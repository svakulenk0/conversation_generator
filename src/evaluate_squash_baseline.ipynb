      "What are the symptoms of anemia?\n",
      "Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a disorder characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), movement problems, increased susceptibility to infection, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function. The anemia in this condition begins in infancy. Since the anemia results from the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic anemia. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. When the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. The movement problems are caused by impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. This impairment leads to muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), tremors, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Affected individuals may also develop seizures. Weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. Individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells. These immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The most common infections in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. People with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often don't survive past childhood due to respiratory failure. In a few rare cases, affected individuals without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood. The deficiency is most commonly caused by mutations in TPI1, although mutations in other isoforms have been identified. A common marker for TPI deficiency is the increased accumulation of DHAP in erythrocyte extracts; this is because the defective enzyme no longer has the ability to catalyze the isomerization to GAP. The point mutation does not affect the catalysis rate, but rather, affects the assembly of the enzyme into a homodimer.\n",

      "The symptoms of pernicious anemia come on slowly. Untreated, it can lead to neurological complications, and in serious cases, death. Many of the signs and symptoms are due to anemia itself, when anemia is present. Symptoms may consist of the triad of tingling or other skin sensations ( paresthesia ), tongue soreness ( glossitis ), and  fatigue  and general weakness. It presents with a number of further common symptoms, including  depressive mood, low-grade  fever s,  diarrhea,  dyspepsia, weight loss,  neuropathic pain,  jaundice, sores at the corner of the mouth ( angular cheilitis ), a look of exhaustion with pale and dehydrated or cracked lips and dark circles around the eyes, as well as brittle nails, and thinning and early greying of the hair. Because PA may affect the nervous system, symptoms may also include difficulty in  proprioception, memory changes, mild cognitive impairment (including difficulty concentrating and sluggish responses, colloquially referred to as  brain fog ), and even psychoses, impaired urination, loss of sensation in the feet, unsteady gait, difficulty in walking,  muscle weakness  and clumsiness. Anemia may also lead to tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), cardiac murmurs, a yellow waxy  pallor, altered blood pressure ( low  or  high ), and a  shortness of breath  (known as \"the sighs\"). The deficiency also may present with thyroid disorders. In severe cases, the anemia may cause evidence of congestive heart failure. A complication of severe chronic PA is  subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, which leads to distal sensory loss (posterior column), absent ankle reflex, increased knee reflex response, and extensor plantar response. Other than anemia, hematological symptoms may include  cytopenia s, intramedullary  hemolysis, and pseudothrombotic microangiopathy. Pernicious anemia can contribute to a delay in physical growth in children, and may also be a cause for delay in puberty for adolescents.\n",

The symptoms can be related to an underlying cause or the anemia itself.Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of  weakness  or  tired, and sometimes poor concentration. They may also report  shortness of breath  on exertion.  In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing  cardiac output.  The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as  palpitation s,  angina  (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent  claudication  of the legs, and symptoms of  heart failure.On examination, the signs exhibited may include  pallor  ( pale   skin, lining  mucosa,  conjunctiva  and  nail beds ), but this is not a reliable sign.  There may be signs of specific causes of anemia, e.g.,  koilonychia  (in iron deficiency),  jaundice  (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells — in hemolytic anemia), bone deformities (found in  thalassemia  major) or  leg   ulcers  (seen in  sickle-cell disease ).In severe anemia, there may be signs of a  hyperdynamic circulation :  tachycardia  (a fast heart rate),  bounding pulse,  flow murmurs, and  cardiac   ventricular hypertrophy  (enlargement).  There may be signs of  heart failure. Pica, the consumption of non-food items such as ice, but also paper, wax, or grass, and even hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency, although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of  hemoglobin.Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced academic performance in children of school age.

This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak.
