37	what else can you tell me about wage slavery?	As per  Noam Chomsky , analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the  Enlightenment  era. In his 1791 book On the Limits of State Action, classical  liberal  thinker  Wilhelm von Humboldt  posited that "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the labourer works under external control, "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is." Both the  Milgram  and  Stanford experiment s have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.
37	who conducted the stanford prison experiment?	Also, researchers from  Western Kentucky University  argued that  selection bias  may have played a role in the results. The researchers recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying "a psychological study" (the control group), and some with the words "prison life" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the "prison study" were higher in traits such as  social dominance ,  aggression ,  authoritarianism , etc. and were lower in traits related to  empathy  and  altruism  when statistically compared to the control group participants.
37	when was the stanford prison experiment conducted?	The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted by Professor Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University in 1971 and was designed to explore the psychological impact of the prison environment on prisoners and prison guards.
37	who was the subject of the milgram experiment?	The  Milgram experiment  was a study done in the early 1960s that helped measure a person's moral character. Subjects from different  socio-economic group s were tested on their willingness to press a  buzzer  that caused a participant— posing as a  subject — in another room to express great  pain  and distress for giving a wrong answer to a test question. When the subjects raised questions about what they are being asked to do, the  experiment er applied mild pressure in the form of appealing to the need to complete the experiment. The Milgram experiment caused a huge amount of criticism among individuals.  In post-experiment interviews with subjects Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the wrongness of what they were doing. Although the subjects may have had moral values, many were criticized on whether they were a truly moral character.
37	who was the author of the milgram experiment?	This programme also included a re-enactment of the  Milgram experiment  — originally carried out by  Yale University  psychologist  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s – with the aim of selecting four of the most obedient of the group. Sixty-five percent of the subjects in this experiment were willing to administer what they believed to be lethal  electric shock s to another person on the instruction of an  authority figure  (unbeknownst to the subjects, no electric shocks were actually administered). These were roughly the same results Milgram himself had observed.
37	what else can you tell me about the milgram experiment?	In one classical study, Stanley Milgram (as part of the  Milgram experiment ) created a highly controversial and often replicated study. The experiment involved  deception  of the participants. In the experiment, participants were told they were going to contribute to a study about punishment and learning, but the actual focus was on how long they would listen to and obey orders from the experimenter. The participants were instructed that they had to shock a person in another room for every wrong answer on a learning task, and the shocks increased with intensity for each wrong answer. If participants questioned the procedure, the researcher would encourage them further. The  dependent variable  for this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered.

The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted by Professor Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University in 1971 and was designed to explore the psychological impact of the prison environment on prisoners and prison guards.ut despite overwhelming evidence pointing to the immorality of the experiment, it was not until Zimbardoâs girlfriend of the time, graduate student Christine Maslach, expressed concerns about the conditions inside the prison that the experiment was aborted.
37	what was the significance of the milgram experiment?	The  Milgram experiment  is the name of a 1961 experiment conducted by American psychologist  Stanley Milgram . In the experiment Milgram had an authority figure order research participants to commit a disturbing act of harming another person. After the experiment he would reveal that he had deceived the participants and that they had not hurt anyone, but the research participants were upset at the experience of having participated in the research. The experiment raised broad discussion on the ethics of recruiting participants for research without giving them full information about the nature of the research.
37	what was the name of the study conducted at stanford?	The Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) was a study of the  psychological  effects of perceived power. Specifically, the study focused on the power struggle between  prisoner s and  prison guard s. The experiment was conducted at  Stanford University  on August 14–20, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  using college students. It was funded by the  U.S. Office of Naval Research  and was of interest to both the  U.S. Navy  and  Marine Corps  as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners.  The experiment is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.
37	in what year did the stanford prison experiment take place?	In 1971,  Stanford University   psychologist   Philip Zimbardo  conducted the  Stanford prison experiment  in which twenty-four male students were randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. The participants adapted to their roles beyond Zimbardo's expectations with prison guards exhibiting  authoritarian  status and psychologically abusing the prisoners who were passive in their acceptance of the abuse. The experiment was largely controversial with criticisms aimed toward the lack of scientific principles and a control group, and for ethical concerns regarding Zimbardo's lack of intervention in the prisoner abuse.

37	how did the experiment affect the experiment?	The Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the  research ethics  of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and  inflicted insight  suffered by the participants. In Milgram's defense, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were "glad" or "very glad" to have participated; 15 percent chose neutral responses (92% of all former participants responding). Many later wrote expressing thanks. Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants. Six years later (at the height of the  Vietnam War ), one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram, explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress:

A few hung on to the idea of orthogenesis as late as the 1950s by claiming that the processes of  macroevolution , the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of  microevolution .
56	what was darwin's theory of natural selection?	Summary of Scientific Theories about Evolution before Darwin's Discovery of Natural Selection. Darwin's theory of Natural Selection is generally regarded as a significant landmark in the origin of organisms and evolution process. Before Darwin, many scientists like him alleged that species evolved from other species or antecedent.
56	what year did charles darwin publish on the origin of species?	Soon after these discoveries, Ichthyornis was recognized for its significance to the theory of evolution recently published by Charles Darwin. Darwin himself told Marsh in an 1880 letter that Ichthyornis and  Hesperornis  offered "the best support for the theory of evolution" since he had first published  On the Origin of Species  in 1859. (While  Archaeopteryx  was the first known Mesozoic avialan and is now known to have also had teeth, the first specimen with a skull was not described until 1884). Others at the time also recognized the implications of a nearly modern bird with reptilian teeth, and feared the controversy it caused. One Yale student described various men and women urging Marsh to conceal Ichthyornis from the public because it lent too much support to evolutionary theory. Many accused Marsh of having tampered with the fossils or intentionally created a hoax by associating reptilian jaws with the body of a bird, accusations that continued to surface even as late as 1967. However, an overwhelming majority of researchers have demonstrated that Marsh's interpretation of the fossils was correct, and he was fully vindicated by later finds.

56	what did charles darwin do in his early years?	In 1859,  Charles Darwin  placed the whole theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so. This changed the attitudes of most exponents of the scientific method. Darwin's discoveries revolutionised the zoological and botanical sciences, by introducing the  theory  of  evolution  by  natural selection  as an explanation for the diversity of all animal and plant life. The subject-matter of this new science, or branch of biological science, had been neglected: it did not form part of the studies of the collector and systematist, nor was it a branch of anatomy, nor of the physiology pursued by medical men, nor again was it included in the field of microscopy and the cell theory. Almost a thousand years before Darwin, the Arab scholar  Al-Jahiz  (781 – 868) had already developed a rudimentary theory of natural selection , describing the  Struggle for existence  in his Book of Animals where he speculates on how environmental factors can affect the characteristics of species by forcing them to adapt and then passing on those new traits to future generations. However, his work had largely been forgotten, along with many other early advances of Arab scientists, and there is no evidence that his works were known to Darwin.
56	what else is important about macroevolution?	Macroevolution includes changes occurring on geological time scales, in contrast to microevolution, which occurs on any time scale. Macroevolution and the modern synthesis. Within the modern synthesis of the early 20th century, macroevolution is thought of as the compounded effects of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one â the only difference between them is of time and scale.
56	who was the author of on the origin of species?	The most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck ; based on the  inheritance of acquired characteristics  (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist  Charles Darwin , combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell,  Thomas Malthus 's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on  natural selection ; similar evidence led  Alfred Russel Wallace  to independently reach the same conclusions.  Charles Darwin 's early interest in nature led him on a  five-year voyage  on  which established him as an eminent  geologist  whose observations and theories supported  Charles Lyell 's  uniformitarian  ideas, and publication of his  journal of the voyage  made him famous as a popular author. Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and  fossil s he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the  transmutation of species  and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when  Alfred Russel Wallace  sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of  both of their theories .Darwin's  On the Origin of Species , published on 24 November 1859, a seminal work of scientific literature, was to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.

56	what is the difference between macroevolution and microevolution?	Microevolution can be contrasted with macroevolution, which is the occurrence of large-scale changes in gene frequencies in a population over a geological time period (i.e. consisting of either rapid or extended microevolution). The difference is largely one of approach.
56	what else did charles darwin do in his later years?	In the early 19th century Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 â 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution. In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor.

In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor.

56	what other terms are used to describe macroevolution?	Macroevolution is  evolution  on a scale at or above the level of  species , in contrast with  microevolution , which refers to smaller evolutionary changes of  allele frequencies  within a species or population. Macroevolution and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time scales.
56	what is the best explanation for the great diversity of life we see?	Answer: Evolution explains the diversity of life that we see. Explanation: Darwin's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection is by far the best explanation for the great diversity of life that we see. Before Darwin's time, science knew that life evolved, since they saw the fossils (fossils were a popular spectacle back then) and their resemblance to extant life.
56	what are the four fundamental forces of evolution?	Mechanisms of Evolutionary Change. Microevolution (evolution on a small-scale) refers to the changes in allele frequencies within a single population. Allele frequencies in a population may change due to four fundamental forces of evolution: Natural Selection, Genetic Drift, Mutations and Gene Flow. Mutations are the ultimate source of new alleles in a gene pool. Two of the most relevant mechanisms of evolutionary change are: Natural Selection and Genetic Drift.
56	when was charles darwin's theory of evolution published?	Darwin's Theory. In 1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for adaptation and speciation. He defined natural selection as the principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is preserved.
56	what did charles darwin think about evolution?	Charles Darwin  had argued that  humanity evolved in Africa , because this is where  great ape s like  gorillas  and  chimpanzees  lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the  fossil  record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like  Charles Lyell , a  geologist , and  Alfred Russel Wallace , who had thought of the  theory of evolution  around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to  gibbon s and  orangutan s, they identified  Southeast Asia  as the cradle of humanity because this is where these great apes lived. Dutch anatomist  Eugène Dubois  favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.
56	how many processes are involved in microevolution?	Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population. This change is due to four different processes: mutation, selection (natural and artificial), gene flow, and genetic drift. This change happens over a relatively short (in evolutionary terms) amount of time compared to the changes termed 'macroevolution' which is where greater differences in the population occur.
56	what evidence did he use to support the theory?	This evidence explicates that evolution does occur, and is able to show the natural processes by which the biodiversity of life on Earth developed. Additionally, this evidence supports the modern evolutionary synthesis âthe current scientific theory that explains how and why life changes over time.urther evidence comes from the field of biogeography because evolution with common descent provides the best and most thorough explanation for a variety of facts concerning the geographical distribution of plants and animals across the world.
56	what else is interesting about the term darwinism?	Darwinism is a  theory  of  biological   evolution  developed by the English  naturalist   Charles Darwin  (1809-1882) and others, stating that all  species  of  organism s arise and develop through the  natural selection  of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and  reproduce . Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of  transmutation of species  or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published  On the Origin of Species  in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories, but subsequently referred to specific concepts of natural selection, of the  Weismann barrier  or in  genetics  of the  central dogma of molecular biology . Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution,  creationists  have appropriated it to refer to the  origin of life , and it has even been applied to concepts of  cosmic evolution , both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work—in place of other theories, including  divine design  and  extraterrestrial origins .
56	who was the author of "the origin of species"?	While on the Erebus, Hooker had read proofs of  Charles Darwin 's  Voyage of the Beagle  provided by  Charles Lyell  and had been very impressed by Darwin's skill as a naturalist. They had met once, before the Antarctic voyage embarked. After Hooker's return to England, he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the  Galápagos Islands . Hooker agreed and the pair began a lifelong friendship. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the  transmutation of species  and  natural selection , and Hooker showed interest. In 1847 he agreed to read Darwin's "Essay" explaining the theory, and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback. Their correspondence continued throughout the  development of Darwin's theory  and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was "the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy".
56	when was on the origins of species published?	Darwin began formulating his theory of natural selection in the late 1830s but he went on working quietly on it for twenty years. He wanted to amass a wealth of evidence before publicly presenting his idea. During those years he corresponded briefly with Wallace (right), who was exploring the wildlife of South America and Asia. Wallace supplied Darwin with birds for his studies and decided to seek Darwin's help in publishing his own ideas on evolution. He sent Darwin his theory in 1858, which, to Darwin's shock, nearly replicated Darwin's own. Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker arranged for both Darwin's and Wallace's theories to be presented to a meeting of the Linnaean Society in 1858. Darwin had been working on a major book on evolution and used that to develop On the Origins of Species, which was published in 1859.

56	what did charles darwin say about evolution?	The work is an examination of  naturalist   Charles Darwin  and the  theory  of  evolution  he proposed and marshaled evidence for in  The Origin of Species . A brief account of his visit to the  Galápagos Islands  brings up the issue of  human origins , leading into a discussion of early theories on the formation and age of the earth and evolution. A biographical sketch of Darwin follows, covering his youth, his naturalistic studies on the voyage of the  Beagle  and subsequent life, focusing on his scientific researches and writings. The history of the theory of human evolution as currently understood is then presented, with sections on the work of  Mendel , the development of the science of  genetics , and the  Scopes Trial . It includes a selected bibliography and index.
56	what did charles darwin say about the theory?	The recent African origin of modern humans is the mainstream model that describes the origin and  early dispersal  of  anatomically modern humans .  The theory is called the (Recent) Out-of-Africa model in the popular press, and academically the recent single-origin hypothesis (RSOH), Replacement Hypothesis, and Recent African Origin (RAO) model.  The hypothesis that humans have a single origin (monogenesis) was published in  Charles Darwin 's  Descent of Man  (1871).  The concept was speculative until the 1980s, when it was corroborated by a study of present-day  mitochondrial DNA , combined with evidence based on  physical anthropology  of archaic  specimens .  According to genetic and fossil evidence,  archaic Homo sapiens  evolved to  anatomically modern humans  solely in  Africa , between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, with members of one branch leaving Africa by 60,000 years ago and over time replacing earlier human populations such as  Neanderthals  and  Homo erectus .
56	when did darwin publish on the origin of species?	The modern understanding of evolution began with the 1859 publication of  Charles Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species . In addition,  Gregor Mendel 's work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of  genetics . Fossil discoveries in  paleontology , advances in  population genetics  and a global network of scientific research have provided further details into the mechanisms of evolution. Scientists now have a good understanding of the origin of new species ( speciation ) and have observed the speciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal  scientific theory  that  biologist s use to understand life and is used in many disciplines, including  medicine ,  psychology ,  conservation biology ,  anthropology ,  forensics ,  agriculture  and other  social-cultural  applications.
56	what is charles darwin's theory of evolution?	Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection underlies all modern biology. It enables us to decipher our genes and fight viruses, and to understand Earth's fossil record and rich biodiversity. Simple yet at times controversial, misunderstood and misused for social goals, the theory remains unchallenged as the central concept of biology. Charles Darwin, reluctant revolutionary, profoundly altered our view of the natural world and our place in it. Charles Darwin looked closely at life. The vast and marvelous diversity of life on Earth, from barnacles to butterflies, ostriches to orchids, made him curious.
56	what is the advantage of sexual reproduction?	As the snails can reproduce both sexually and asexually, the snail has been used as a model organism for studying the costs and benefits of sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction allows all members of a population to produce offspring and avoids the costs involved in finding mates. However, asexual offspring are  clonal , so lack variation. This makes them susceptible to parasites, as the entire clonal population has the same resistance mechanisms. Once a strain of parasite has overcome these mechanisms, it is able to infect any member of the population. Sexual reproduction mixes up resistance genes through  crossing over  and the random assortment of gametes in  meiosis , meaning the members of a sexual population will all have subtly different combinations of resistance genes. This variation in resistance genes means no one parasite strain is able to sweep through the whole population. New Zealand mudsnails are commonly infected with  trematode  parasites, which are particularly abundant in shallow water, but scarce in deeper water. As predicted, sexual reproduction dominates in shallow water, due to its advantages in parasite resistance. Asexual reproduction is dominant in the deeper water of lakes, as the scarcity of parasites means that the advantages of resistance are outweighed by the costs of sexual reproduction.
56	what is significant about the fossil record?	Further important evidence from the fossil record is the absence of transitional forms between species. Darwin was concerned that the thousands of intermediate stages between creatures needed to prove his theory were not in evidence, but he expected they would eventually be found.

61	what is the name of the main character in the justice league?	The concept of  justice  is a major theme throughout this text. However, the actions of the Justice League in their quest to justify  Sue Dibny's  death are challenged by the seemingly reoccurring theme of  revenge . It can be considered a conflicting matter when determining what is considered justice and what is considered revenge. Justice is more commonly viewed as resolving a matter politically and/or ethically while revenge is seen as imposing suffering on an individual who has made another suffer. The Justice League has the desire for retribution for Sue Dibny's death, however the question lies in the matter of where this desire comes from: personal revenge or unbiased justice. Many factors go into determining what motive the Justice League had in their investigation of Sue's death in terms of revenge and justice. In regards to the characters in the Justice League, the connotation of their title as "Justice League" plays a major role in how their actions can be perceived as justifiable. It can be a preconceived misconception to give the Justice League assured justification in any of their actions, seeing as how their title can lead one to believe their actions are based off their "police" force resemblance. Therefore their actions in the finding of Sue Dibny's killer can be easily observed as acts of justice and of ethical value. Contrarily, these actions can be viewed as an act of revenge carried out by vigilantes. An aspect of the League's situation that makes it susceptible to be viewed as revenge is that it is a personal matter, seeing as how a member in the league (Ralph Dibny) is personally effected from crime. It can be argued that Ralph Dibny, having gone through the suffering of losing his wife, is seeking revenge and the imposition of suffering for the one(s) who is found guilty for the death of his wife. Both themes hold value to the text and can pertain to the given situation, however it is a matter of an individual's perception of the meaning of both themes in association with the comic's context.

61	what else was special about this time period	In 2013, DC began publication of Batman '66, a comic book series telling all-new stories set in the world of the 1966–68 TV series.  Jeff Parker  writes the series, which features cover art by  Mike Allred  and interior art by different artists each issue. In the course of this series, the Bookworm, the Minstrel, Sandman, Olga Queen of the Cossacks, Zelda The Great, Shame, and Marsha Queen of Diamonds all have their first appearance in Batman comics. Penguin, Joker, Riddler, Catwoman and Mr. Freeze also appear in the series. Issue #3 of Batman '66 introduced the  Red Hood  and  Dr. Quinn  into the series continuity. In issue #7, Batman used a new vehicle, the Bat-Jet, to follow False-Face to Mount Rushmore. The series was to have introduced  Killer Croc  into the continuity, as well as a new villainess named Cleopatra. In April 2014, the first five issues were compiled into the Batman '66 Vol. 1 trade paperback.  Kevin Smith  and  Ralph Garman  likewise worked on a Batman and Green Hornet crossover, titled Batman '66 meets The Green Hornet. The six-issue mini-series began publication in June 2014.

Thus far, this has not been the case, although several such alternative Earths inhabitants and representative metahumans remain undisclosed.
61	who is a member of the justice league of america?	Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the  Justice League of America  and the  Outsiders . Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of World's Finest and  Superman/Batman  series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In  Superman/Batman  #3 (December 2003),  Superman  observes, "Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him."
61	what was the first appearance of the justice league?	The pilot episode (later re-broadcast as the opening two episodes of season 1) aired a month prior to the debut of the regular series and introduced four characters:  Robin ,  Aqualad ,  Kid Flash , and  Speedy . It established their desire for greater recognition and respect, namely, a promotion from sidekicks to full-fledged superheroes. Met with opposition from their respective mentors in the Justice League,  Batman ,  Aquaman ,  Flash , and  Green Arrow , the protégés react in different ways. Speedy resigns from being Green Arrow's partner and begins calling himself Red Arrow. The others seek to persuade their mentors of their worth by secretly taking on a Justice League mission to investigate the  Cadmus  building. During their infiltration of Cadmus' headquarters, the three heroes find a clone of  Superman  named  Superboy . After the discovery, the team finds out Cadmus is creating living weapons called Genomorphs. The episode deals with this revelation, the origin of Superboy, and how this relates to a mysterious group of people called the Light. In the end, Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, and Superboy negotiate with Batman to organize a covert operations team as a practical contrast to the Justice League, whose celebrity status makes it difficult to maintain secrecy or initiate stealth operations. After consulting with his colleagues, Batman establishes Young Justice in a secret cave located inside a former Justice League headquarters,  Mount Justice , a hollowed-out mountain. Here the teens are trained by  Black Canary , given missions by Batman and are watched over by  Red Tornado  until episode twelve when this job is passed over to rotating Justice League members.  Miss Martian  makes an appearance at the end of the episode and joins as the fifth member.

79	who was the first president of the american sociological association?	The first college course entitled "Sociology" was taught in the United States at  Yale  in 1875 by  William Graham Sumner . In 1883  Lester F. Ward , the first president of the American Sociological Association, published Dynamic Sociology—Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez-faire sociology of  Herbert Spencer  and Sumner. Ward's 1200 page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the  University of Kansas , lectured by  Frank W. Blackmar . The Department of Sociology at the  University of Chicago  was established in 1892 by  Albion Small , who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894.  George Herbert Mead  and  Charles Cooley , who had met at the  University of Michigan  in 1891 (along with  John Dewey ), would move to Chicago in 1894.

79	what is the common analogy between functionalism and anthropology?	A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and  anthropology , functionalism addresses the  social structure , referred to as  social organization  in among the classical theorists, as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by  Herbert Spencer ) is to regard  norm s and  institution s as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as  Marcel Mauss ,  Bronisław Malinowski  and  Radcliffe-Brown . It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of  social evolutionism , in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As  Giddens  states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."
79	what was herbert spencer's early social science?	The early sociology of  Herbert Spencer  came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms.
79	what is the relation between comte and sociology?	Figure 1: Auguste Comte, Father of Sociology.

79	what is at the heart of all social relationships?	The following are three primary assumptions of modern conflict theory: 1  Competition over scarce resources is at the heart of all social relationships. 2  Inequalities in power and reward are built into all social structures. 3  Change occurs as a result of conflict between competing interests rather than through adaptation.

79	what did he do at the university of bordeaux?	Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker,  Émile Durkheim  (1858–1917), who developed positivism in greater detail. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the  University of Bordeaux  in 1895, publishing his  Rules of the Sociological Method . In 1896, he established the journal  L'Année Sociologique . Durkheim's seminal monograph,  Suicide  (1897), a case study of suicide rates among  Catholic  and  Protestant  populations, distinguished sociological analysis from  psychology  or  philosophy . It also marked a major contribution to the concept of  structural functionalism .

79	who is the father of social conflict theory?	Social conflict  is the struggle between segments of society over valued resources. From the perspective of social conflict theory, in the West, by the nineteenth century, a small population had become capitalists. Capitalists are people who own and operate factories and other businesses in pursuit of profits. In other words, they own virtually all large-scale means of production. However, capitalism turned most other people into industrial workers, whom Marx called proletarians. Proletarians are people who, because of the structure of capitalist economy, must sell their labor for wages. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class, gender and race conflict, and contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro level analysis of society that sees society as an arena of inequality that generates conflict and social change. Karl Marx is the father of the  social conflict theory , which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology. Other important sociologists associated with this theory include Harriet Martineau, Jane Addams and W.E.B. Du Bois. This sociological approach doesn't look at how social structures help society to operate, but instead looks at how "social patterns" can cause some people in society to be dominant, and others to be oppressed. However, some criticisms to this theory are that it disregards how shared values and the way in which people rely on each other help to unify the society.
79	when was isidore marie auguste franã§ois xavier comte born?	Isidore Marie Auguste FranÃ§ois Xavier Comte (French pronunciation: â; 19 January 1798 â 5 September 1857) was a French philosopher who founded the discipline of praxeology and the doctrine of positivism. He is sometimes regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.
79	who translated the positive philosophy of auguste comte?	Positivism is the objective and value-free observation, comparison, and experimentation applied to scientific inquiry. Positivism was Comte's way of describing the science needed for sociology to takes its place among the other scientific disciplines. His core work, The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte was translated by a British-born philosopher named Harriet Martineau (1802-1876).
79	what are some other important aspects of conflict theory?	Conflict theorists, and therefore Dahrendorf, often took the exact opposite view of functionalists.  Whereas functionalists believe that society was oscillating very slightly, if not completely static, conflict theorists said that every society at every point is subject to process of change". He believes that there is "dissension and conflict at every point in the social system" and "many societal elements as contributing to disintegration and change". They believe order comes from coercion from those at the top. They believe that power is an important factor in social order. Dahrendorf believes that both conflict theory and consensus theory are necessary because they reflect the two parts of society.
79	what else can you tell me about functionalism?	Mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience. By providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data, mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works. This is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states (mental states) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms.

31	what happens to the lining of the esophagus?	1. Reflux. What it feels like: Heartburn, a burning, stinging sensation rising from your stomach and chest to your throat; a sour taste in your mouth or constant need to clear your throat; episodes of coughing. If these symptoms happen frequently, you may have gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). What causes it: The valve between the esophagus and the stomach doesn't work properly, allowing stomach acid to leak upward. Severe cases can damage the lining of the esophagus, putting you at risk for esophageal cancer.
31	what else can you tell me about the disease?	Identification. The first signs of throat cancer vary considerably, which makes the disease difficult to detect and diagnose in early stages. The most commonly experienced early symptoms include a persistent sore throat, a lump in the neck, difficulty swallowing, ear or neck pain, and a change in voice.
31	what else can you tell me about esophageal cancer?

31	how many different types of cancer are there?	CIP2A is over-expressed in several common human malignancies including, human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ),  colon cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. Notably, in these cancer types CIP2A over-expression is observed with very high frequency;  in breast cancer around 40% of cancer patients are over-expressing CIP2A whereas in all other studied cancer types the frequency is between 65-87 percent. In breast cancer CIP2A expression correlates with disease aggressivity whereas in gastric and lung cancer CIP2A expression predicts for poor patient survival.

31	what is the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme?	An explosion of new knowledge, accumulated mainly over the last 20 years, has proved that lung cancers should be considered an extremely  heterogeneous  family of  neoplasms  with widely varying genetic, biological, and clinical characteristics, particularly their responsiveness to the large number of newer treatment protocols. Well over 50 different histological variants are now recognized under the 2004 revision of the  World Health Organization  ("WHO-2004") typing system, currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme. Recent studies have shown beyond doubt that the old clinical classification paradigm of "SCLC vs. NSCLC" is now obsolete, and that correct "subclassification" of lung cancer cases is necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management.

67	what is the abbreviation for red blood cells?	RBC: Short for red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen and carbon dioxide through the blood. This rather remarkable feat is thanks to hemoglobin, the pigment that makes red cells (and blood) look red. The red blood cells are also known as red corpuscles or erythrocytes (literally, red hollow vessels). RBC also stands for the red cell count, the number of red blood cells in a given volume of blood.
67	how many types of red blood cells are there?	Erythrocytes or red blood cells carry oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the bloodstream. So oxygen is carried inside of these cells. It is delivered to the tissues (w â¦ hich are composed of cells) when oxygen-containing red blood cells enter a capillary that passes through a tissue. The oxygen leaves the red blood cells and passes through the wall of the capillary where it can be taken up by the cells of the tissue. Blood type refers to particular proteins called antigens on the surface of these red blood cells. Some people's red blood cells have the A antigen on their surface; these people have type A blood. Some people have the B antigen and are type B. Some have both (AB) and some have neither (type O). Any given person will only have one blood type (you only have type O or type A blood) and all of the red blood cells in that person are the same type. No one of these blood types is any better or worse than transporting oxygen.

Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.
67	what else can you tell me about vitamin b12?	It can also be made in a laboratory. Vitamin B12 is used for treating and preventing vitamin B12 deficiency, a condition in which vitamin B12 levels in the blood are too low. It is also used to treat pernicious anemia, a serious type of anemia that is due to vitamin B12 deficiency and is found mostly in older people. Injecting vitamin B12 as a shot, as well as taking through the nose or by mouth, is effective for treating low red blood cell counts caused by poor absorption of vitamin B12. 2  Vitamin B12 deficiency. 3  Taking vitamin B12 by mouth, through the nose, or as a shot is effective for treating vitamin B12 deficiency.
67	how many possible causes of anemia are there?	The various causes of different types of anemia will be discussed in later chapters, but first it is important to consider what all anemias and people with anemia have in common. As stated earlier, anemia is the condition characterized by an abnormal decrease in the body's total red blood cell mass. There are two possibilities as to what happens then to the blood's physical properties. The first is that, as the mass of red cells goes down, so does the total volume of blood.
67	what part of the body is affected by anemia?	Symptoms include tachycardia, hypotension, lethargy, and weakness. Anemia is a decrease in the mass of red blood cells, the result of lack of production, loss of red blood cells, or destruction of red blood cells. There are two types of anemia: regenerative and non-regenerative. In non-regenerative anemia, the cause is usually a decrease in erythropoietin (a hormone controlled by the kidneys that influences red blood cell production as a response to low oxygen in tissues) or bone marrow abnormalities. The bone marrow does not effectively respond to the decrease levels of red blood cells.
67	how many easy fatigue and loss of energy symptoms are there in anemia?	Symptoms. Diagnosis and Treatment. Symptoms common to many types of anemia include the following: 1  Easy fatigue and loss of energy. 2  Unusually rapid heart beat, particularly with exercise. 3  Shortness of breath and headache, particularly with exercise. 4  Difficulty concentrating. 5  Dizziness.6  Pale skin. 7  Leg cramps. 8  Insomnia.ymptoms.

67	what are some other symptoms of pernicious anemia?	A lack of vitamin B12 (vitamin B12 deficiency) causes the signs and symptoms of pernicious anemia. Without enough vitamin B12, your body can't make enough healthy red blood cells, which causes anemia.Some of the signs and symptoms of pernicious anemia apply to all types of anemia. Other signs and symptoms are specific to a lack of vitamin B12.ithout enough vitamin B12, your body can't make enough healthy red blood cells, which causes anemia. Some of the signs and symptoms of pernicious anemia apply to all types of anemia. Other signs and symptoms are specific to a lack of vitamin B12.
67	what are some other possible causes of anemia?	The symptoms of pernicious anemia come on slowly. Untreated, it can lead to neurological complications, and in serious cases, death. Many of the signs and symptoms are due to anemia itself, when anemia is present. Symptoms may consist of the triad of tingling or other skin sensations ( paresthesia ), tongue soreness ( glossitis ), and  fatigue  and general weakness. It presents with a number of further common symptoms, including  depressive mood , low-grade  fever s,  diarrhea ,  dyspepsia , weight loss,  neuropathic pain ,  jaundice , sores at the corner of the mouth ( angular cheilitis ), a look of exhaustion with pale and dehydrated or cracked lips and dark circles around the eyes, as well as brittle nails, and thinning and early greying of the hair. Because PA may affect the nervous system, symptoms may also include difficulty in  proprioception , memory changes, mild cognitive impairment (including difficulty concentrating and sluggish responses, colloquially referred to as  brain fog ), and even psychoses, impaired urination, loss of sensation in the feet, unsteady gait, difficulty in walking,  muscle weakness  and clumsiness. Anemia may also lead to tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), cardiac murmurs, a yellow waxy  pallor , altered blood pressure ( low  or  high ), and a  shortness of breath  (known as "the sighs"). The deficiency also may present with thyroid disorders. In severe cases, the anemia may cause evidence of congestive heart failure. A complication of severe chronic PA is  subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord , which leads to distal sensory loss (posterior column), absent ankle reflex, increased knee reflex response, and extensor plantar response. Other than anemia, hematological symptoms may include  cytopenia s, intramedullary  hemolysis , and pseudothrombotic microangiopathy. Pernicious anemia can contribute to a delay in physical growth in children, and may also be a cause for delay in puberty for adolescents.
67	what is the list of fruits and vegetables high in iron?	While iron is better absorbed from heme (meat) sources, non-heme (plant) iron is better regulated causing less damage to the body. High iron foods include clams, liver, sunflower seeds, nuts, beef, lamb, beans, whole grains, dark leafy greens (spinach), dark chocolate, and tofu. The current daily value (DV) for iron is 18 milligrams (mg). Below is a list of high iron foods. For more high iron foods see the lists of high iron foods by nutrient density, iron rich foods (heme and non-heme), and the list of fruits and vegetables high in iron. #1: Squash and Pumpkin Seeds.
67	people with anemia have a low number of red blood cells.	Blood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms.More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells.Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.ron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells.

50	what is the indian regional navigation satellite system?	The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) with an operational name of NAVIC ("sailor" or "navigator" in  Sanskrit ,  Hindi  and many other Indian languages, which also stands for NAVigation with Indian Constellation) is an autonomous regional  satellite navigation  system that is being set up by  India , that will be used to provide accurate real-time positioning and timing services over India and the region extending to  around India. The NAVIC system will consist of a constellation of 3 satellites in  Geostationary orbit  (GEO), 4 satellites in  Geosynchronous orbit  (GSO), approximately  altitude above earth surface, and two satellites on the ground as stand-by, in addition to ground stations. The system was developed because access to foreign government-controlled  global navigation satellite system s is not guaranteed in hostile situations, as happened to the Indian military in 1999 when it was dependent on the American  Global Positioning System  (GPS) during the  Kargil War . The Indian government approved the project in May 2006.
50	what was the first satellite navigation system?	The TRANSIT system, also known as NAVSAT or NNSS (for Navy Navigation Satellite System), was the first  satellite navigation system  to be used operationally. The system was primarily  used by the  U.S. Navy  to provide accurate location information to its  Polaris   ballistic missile submarine s, and it was also used as a navigation system by the Navy's  surface ship s, as well as for  hydrographic survey  and  geodetic surveying . Transit provided continuous navigation satellite service from 1964, initially for Polaris submarines and later for civilian use as well.
50	when did the first artificial satellite come into being?	The first artificial satellite,  Sputnik 1 , was launched in October 1957. In November,  Laika  became the first animal in orbit.
50	what is the name of the first artificial satellite?	Satellites are objects orbiting a planet. The moon is a natural satellite. Artificial satellites are those put into orbit by man. The first artificial satellite was Sputnik I launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Now almost fifty years later there are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth at various heights.
50	how many satellites are in the constellation?	The constellation consists of 66 active satellites in orbit required for global coverage, and additional spare satellites to serve in case of failure. Satellites are in  low Earth orbit  at a height of approximately  and  inclination  of 86.4°. Orbital velocity of the satellites is approximately .  Satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via  inter-satellite links. Each satellite can have four inter-satellite links: two to neighbors fore and aft in the same orbital plane, and two to satellites in neighboring planes to either side. The satellites orbit from pole to same pole with an orbital period of roughly 100 minutes. This design means that there is excellent satellite visibility and service coverage even at the North and South poles. The over-the-pole orbital design produces "seams" where satellites in counter-rotating planes next to one another are traveling in opposite directions.  Cross-seam inter-satellite link hand-offs would have to happen very rapidly and cope with large  Doppler shifts ; therefore, Iridium supports inter-satellite links only between satellites orbiting in the same direction. The constellation of 66 active satellites has 6  orbital plane s spaced 30 degrees apart, with 11 satellites in each plane (not counting spares). The original concept was to have 77 satellites, which is where the name Iridium came from, being  the element  with the atomic number 77 and the satellites evoking the  Bohr model  image of electrons orbiting around the Earth as its nucleus. This reduced set of 6 planes is sufficient to cover the entire Earth's surface at every moment.

50	what was the first  artificial earth satellite?	To the surprise of many, the  USSR  launched  Sputnik 1  as the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957. After several failed Vanguard launches,  Wernher von Braun  and his team convinced President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  to use one of their US Army missiles for the Explorer program (there then being no inhibition about using military rockets to get into space). On November 8, 1957, the US Secretary of Defense instructed the US Army to use a modified  Jupiter-C  rocket to launch a satellite. The US achieved this goal only four months later with Explorer 1, on February 1, 1958, but after  Sputnik 2  in November 3, 1957, making Explorer 1 the third artificial Earth satellite.  Vanguard 1  became the fourth, launched on March 17, 1958. The  Soviet  victory in the " Space Race " would be followed by considerable political consequences,one of which was the creation of the US space agency  NASA  on July 29, 1958.

34	what else can you tell me about the bronze age?	An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by  smelting  its own  copper  and alloying with  tin ,  arsenic , or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Copper-tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in  Western Asia  before trading in bronze began in the  third millennium BC . Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the  Neolithic  period, with the  Chalcolithic  serving as a transition. Although the  Iron Age  generally followed the Bronze Age, in some areas (such as  Sub-Saharan Africa ), the Iron Age intruded directly on the Neolithic from outside the region.

34	what else can you tell me about the archaeology?	There are some objections to the interpretation of the structure as being a road at all, including the fact that several burial  cist s along the structure's course protrude through its surface by up to 0.4m, highly unusual for a road surface. Since 1997, authorities including English Heritage have accepted the possibility that the structure may not be a road. Archaeological consultant Blaise Vyner suggested in 1997 that the structure may be the collapsed and heavily robbed remains of a  Neolithic  or  Bronze Age  boundary wall or dyke. There are other Neolithic remains on the North York Moors, including boundary dikes, although Knight et al. report that the later Neolithic is very poorly represented archaeologically in the North York Moors area and neolithic use of the moors was likely very limited in extent. Bronze Age presence in the moors, including earthworks, is well represented generally in the archaeology of the area, and therefore is a more plausible origin. Evidence against the identification of the causeway as an early Neolithic structure includes the statement by Elgee in 1912 that the causeway had been identified as cutting across an earlier British earthwork just north of Julian Park, suggesting that it must post-date it. One possibility that could explain several of the anomalies in trying to definitively identify the site is the suggestion by Knight et al. that it was commonly observed practice in the area for dykes to be reused as trackways.

Their plumage differs slightly by subspecies, but is generally dark to black for males, with buff to cream highlights, and generally drab brown for females.
