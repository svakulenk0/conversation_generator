68	what is the difference between whey protein forms?	Whey is a by-product of the cheese-making process. Whey can be processed to yield whey protein in three forms: whey isolate, whey concentrate, or whey hydrolysate. The difference between the whey protein forms is the composition of the product, particularly the protein content.

37	what was the significance of the experiment?	Milgram 18  was reproduced to test the participants in a 2008 television special " The Heist ". Created by  Derren Brown  and  Andy Nyman  for British station  Channel 4, the Milgram experiment helped determine which candidates were the most responsive to authority. The four most responsive and psychologically sound candidates at the end of the show were indirectly given the opportunity to rob a (fake) armoured bank van.
37	what else can you tell me about wage slavery?	As per  Noam Chomsky, analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the  Enlightenment  era. In his 1791 book On the Limits of State Action, classical  liberal  thinker  Wilhelm von Humboldt  posited that "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the labourer works under external control, "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is." Both the  Milgram  and  Stanford experiment s have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.
37	who conducted the stanford prison experiment?	Also, researchers from  Western Kentucky University  argued that  selection bias  may have played a role in the results. The researchers recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying "a psychological study" (the control group), and some with the words "prison life" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the "prison study" were higher in traits such as  social dominance,  aggression,  authoritarianism, etc. and were lower in traits related to  empathy  and  altruism  when statistically compared to the control group participants.
37	who was the subject of the milgram experiment?	The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted by Professor Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University in 1971 and was designed to explore the psychological impact of the prison environment on prisoners and prison guards.
37	what year was the stanford prison experiment?	This programme also included a re-enactment of the  Milgram experiment  — originally carried out by  Yale University  psychologist  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s – with the aim of selecting four of the most obedient of the group. Sixty-five percent of the subjects in this experiment were willing to administer what they believed to be lethal  electric shock s to another person on the instruction of an  authority figure  (unbeknownst to the subjects, no electric shocks were actually administered). These were roughly the same results Milgram himself had observed.

56	what year did charles darwin publish on the origin of species?	Soon after these discoveries, Ichthyornis was recognized for its significance to the theory of evolution recently published by Charles Darwin. Darwin himself told Marsh in an 1880 letter that Ichthyornis and  Hesperornis  offered "the best support for the theory of evolution" since he had first published  On the Origin of Species  in 1859. (While  Archaeopteryx  was the first known Mesozoic avialan and is now known to have also had teeth, the first specimen with a skull was not described until 1884). Others at the time also recognized the implications of a nearly modern bird with reptilian teeth, and feared the controversy it caused. One Yale student described various men and women urging Marsh to conceal Ichthyornis from the public because it lent too much support to evolutionary theory. Many accused Marsh of having tampered with the fossils or intentionally created a hoax by associating reptilian jaws with the body of a bird, accusations that continued to surface even as late as 1967. However, an overwhelming majority of researchers have demonstrated that Marsh's interpretation of the fossils was correct, and he was fully vindicated by later finds.

56	who was the author of on the origin of species?	Macroevolution includes changes occurring on geological time scales, in contrast to microevolution, which occurs on any time scale. Macroevolution and the modern synthesis. Within the modern synthesis of the early 20th century, macroevolution is thought of as the compounded effects of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one â the only difference between them is of time and scale.
56	when was on the origin of species published?	The most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck ; based on the  inheritance of acquired characteristics  (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist  Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell,  Thomas Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on  natural selection ; similar evidence led  Alfred Russel Wallace  to independently reach the same conclusions.  Charles Darwin's early interest in nature led him on a  five-year voyage  on  which established him as an eminent  geologist  whose observations and theories supported  Charles Lyell's  uniformitarian  ideas, and publication of his  journal of the voyage  made him famous as a popular author. Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and  fossil s he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the  transmutation of species  and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when  Alfred Russel Wallace  sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of  both of their theories.Darwin's  On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, a seminal work of scientific literature, was to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.
56	when was charles darwin's theory of evolution published?	Answer: Evolution explains the diversity of life that we see. Explanation: Darwin's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection is by far the best explanation for the great diversity of life that we see. Before Darwin's time, science knew that life evolved, since they saw the fossils (fossils were a popular spectacle back then) and their resemblance to extant life.
56	what did charles darwin think about evolution?	Mechanisms of Evolutionary Change. Microevolution (evolution on a small-scale) refers to the changes in allele frequencies within a single population. Allele frequencies in a population may change due to four fundamental forces of evolution: Natural Selection, Genetic Drift, Mutations and Gene Flow. Mutations are the ultimate source of new alleles in a gene pool. Two of the most relevant mechanisms of evolutionary change are: Natural Selection and Genetic Drift.

79	who is the author of the functionalist perspective?	By Ashley Crossman. The functionalist perspective, also called functionalism, is one of the major theoretical perspectives in sociology. It has its origins in the works of Emile Durkheim, who was especially interested in how social order is possible or how society remains relatively stable.rom this perspective, disorganization in the system, such as deviant behavior, leads to change because societal components must adjust to achieve stability. When one part of the system is not working or is dysfunctional, it affects all other parts and creates social problems, which leads to social change.

31	what is another name for common throat cancer?	CIP2A is over-expressed in several common human malignancies including, human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ),  colon cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. Notably, in these cancer types CIP2A over-expression is observed with very high frequency;  in breast cancer around 40% of cancer patients are over-expressing CIP2A whereas in all other studied cancer types the frequency is between 65-87 percent. In breast cancer CIP2A expression correlates with disease aggressivity whereas in gastric and lung cancer CIP2A expression predicts for poor patient survival. To date high CIP2A expression has been observed to predict poor patient prognosis in more than dozen human cancer types, which makes it one of the most frequently altered human oncoprotein with clinical relevance.

32	how many different types of shark teeth are there?	There are four different types of shark teeth. While sharksâ teeth do share the common traits described above, they have very different shapes and uses. There are four basic groups of shark diets and because of this there are four basic types of shark teeth.-Sharks that typically eat fish have long, narrow, needle-like teeth ideal for gripping something as slippery and streamlined as a fish.-Sharks that are benthic feeders, eating bivalves and crustaceans, have thick, plate-like teeth perfect for crushing the shells of their prey. sharkâs teeth are arranged in rows, the number of which varies from species to species. The row nearest the front of the mouth is the âworkingâ row of teeth (though some sharks use up to the first 8 rows of teeth), and they are the largest teeth in a sharksâ mouth.

59	what are some of the most common sports injuries?	In this Article. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is a ligament within the knee. Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect bones. The PCL -- similar to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) -- connects the thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia). Although it is larger and stronger than the ACL, the PCL can be torn.
59	how many major ligaments are there in the knee?	A concussion can be caused by direct blows to the head, gunshot wounds, violent shaking of the head, or force from a whiplash type injury. Both closed and open head injuries can produce a concussion. A concussion is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. A concussion is caused when the brain receives trauma from an impact or a sudden momentum or movement change. The blood vessels in the brain may stretch and cranial nerves may be damaged. A person may or may not experience a brief loss of consciousness.
59	what is the goal of treatment for an acl injury?	Surgery for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries involves reconstructing or repairing the ACL. 1  ACL reconstruction surgery uses a graft to replace the ligament. 2  Repair surgery typically is used only in the case of an avulsion fracture (a separation of the ligament and a piece of the bone from the rest of the bone).urgery for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries involves reconstructing or repairing the ACL. 1  ACL reconstruction surgery uses a graft to replace the ligament. 2  Repair surgery typically is used only in the case of an avulsion fracture (a separation of the ligament and a piece of the bone from the rest of the bone).

67	what is one of the substances transported with assistance of red blood cells?	Red blood cells and haemoglobin. Oxygen is one of the substances transported with the assistance of red blood cells. The red blood cells contain a pigment called haemoglobin, each molecule of which binds four oxygen molecules. Oxyhaemoglobin forms. The oxygen molecules are carried to individual cells in the body tissue where they are released. The binding of oxygen is a reversible reaction.
67	what is the cause of the megaloblastic anemia?	Low levels of vitamin B12 are a cause of megaloblastic anemia, in which red blood cells are larger than normal. Other possible causes include folate deficiency or various metabolic disorders.
67	what is the main function of red blood cells?	The primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen to body cells and deliver carbon dioxide to the lungs. A red blood cell has what is known as a biconcave shape. Both sides of the cell's surface curve inward like the interior of a sphere.This shape aids in a red blood cell's ability to maneuver through tiny blood vessels to deliver oxygen to organs and tissues.Red blood cells are also important in determining human blood type. Blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain identifiers on the surface of red blood cells. red blood cell has what is known as a biconcave shape. Both sides of the cell's surface curve inward like the interior of a sphere. This shape aids in a red blood cell's ability to maneuver through tiny blood vessels to deliver oxygen to organs and tissues.

67	what is the benefit of iron supplementation?	Red Blood Cells. Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are the most abundant cell type in the blood. Other major blood components include plasma, white blood cells, and platelets. The primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen to body cells and deliver carbon dioxide to the lungs.A red blood cell has what is known as a biconcave shape. Both sides of the cell's surface curve inward like the interior of a sphere.s more red blood cells enter blood circulation, oxygen levels in the blood and tissues increase. When the kidneys sense the increase in oxygen levels in the blood, they slow the release of erythropoietin. As a result, red blood cell production decreases. Red blood cells circulate on average for about 4 months.

67	what part of the body is affected by iron deficiency?	Anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin).Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body.Very severe anemia may even cause death.s a result, you may feel tired or weak.

Very severe anemia may even cause death.
67	what is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells?	What are the three formed elements in blood? The three formed elements of blood are: white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes ). Which formed element in blood is a nucleated cell? Leukocytes (white blood cells - WBCs) are nucleated cells that are formed in the bone marrow from the same stem cells as red blood cells.
67	how many oxygen molecules does haemoglobin bind?	Fortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed.Commonly eaten combinations, such as beans and tomato sauce or stir-fried tofu and broccoli, also result in generous levels of iron absorption.ortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed.

50	who launched the first artificial satellite?	In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik.  Scientists at  Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory  took a series of measurements of Sputniks  doppler shift  yielding the satellite's position and velocity.  This team continued to monitor Sputnik and the next satellites into space, Sputnik II and Explorer I.  In March 1958 the idea of working backwards, using known satellite orbits to determine an unknown position on the Earth's surface began to be explored.  This led to the TRANSIT satellite navigation system.  The first TRANSIT satellite was placed in polar orbit in 1960.  The system, consisting of 7 satellites, was made operational in 1962.  A navigator using readings from three satellites could expect accuracy of about 80 feet.

77	what else can you tell me about the recipes?	Goulash is a rustic stew or soup made with beef and vegetables, and usually seasoned with paprika. Goulash originates in Hungary and in many variations it remains a popular recipe throughout Eastern Europe. Goulash can also be made with veal, pork or lamb in addition to beef.

34	what else can you tell me about the bronze age?	An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by  smelting  its own  copper  and alloying with  tin,  arsenic, or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Copper-tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in  Western Asia  before trading in bronze began in the  third millennium BC. Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the  Neolithic  period, with the  Chalcolithic  serving as a transition. Although the  Iron Age  generally followed the Bronze Age, in some areas (such as  Sub-Saharan Africa ), the Iron Age intruded directly on the Neolithic from outside the region.

75	how many different kinds of turkeys are there?	Turkeys are large, long-legged birds that can grow up to four feet in height and weigh up to 30 lbs in the wild.  They have a long, broad, rounded tail with 14-19 blunt feathers.  They have a naked, wrinkled head and feathered body.  The North American wild turkey – Meleagris gallopavo – has five distinct subspecies (Eastern, Rio Grande, Florida [Osceola], Merriam's, and Gould's).  Hybrids also exist where the ranges of these subspecies overlap.  All are native only to North America, though transplanted populations exist elsewhere.  Their plumage differs slightly by subspecies, but is generally dark to black for males, with buff to cream highlights, and generally drab brown for females.  The feathers are quite iridescent and can take on distinct reddish/copper hues in sunlight.  Their feathers are well defined with broad, square ends, giving the bird the appearance of being covered in scales.  Males have a “beard” of coarse black bristles hanging from the center of their upper breasts and tend to have more vibrantly colored plumage than do females. They breed in the spring and their typical clutch size is between 10 and 12 eggs.  The  ocellated turkey  (Meleagris ocellata), a different species of turkey, currently exists only in a portion of the Yucatán peninsula.  After the 19th and early 20th centuries, wild turkey populations dropped significantly because of hunting and habitat loss.  However, populations now flourish again due to hunting management and transplanting.  The ocellated turkey, not commonly hunted, is currently threatened due to ongoing habitat loss in the Yucutan.
75	what is the national symbol of the united states?	Bronze turkeys are the product of crossing domestic turkeys brought from England, with the  wild turkey. These matings produced a bird that was larger and more robust than the European turkeys, and tamer than wild turkeys. Though the Bronze turkey type was created in the 18th century, the actual name was not used until the 1830s, when a strain developed in the  U.S. state  of  Rhode Island  was named the  Point Judith  Bronze. The name later spread to be used in reference to the breed as a whole, and was in the process simplified to just "Bronze". In the  British Isles, the Bronze was associated with Cambridge, and was called the Cambridge Bronze, but again this name has been simplified to just "Bronze".
