All modern openers are equipped with “force settings” that make the door reverse if it encounters too much resistance while closing or opening. Any garage door opener sold in the United States after 1992 requires safety eyes—sensors that prevent the door from closing if obstructed. Force settings should cause a door to stop or reverse on encountering more than approximately 20 lbs (9.07 kg) of resistance. Safety eyes should be installed a maximum of six inches above the ground. Many garage door injuries, and nearly all garage door related property damage, can be avoided by following these precautions.

As more jobs are using this virtual platform as a standard procedure, the amount of information that is available to be hacked is also increasing. This information may be confidential and if found by the wrong people, detrimental to the business and its customers. One well publicised case was the hacking of the online cheating site Ashley Madison. Consumers joined this site to arrange affairs (cheat on their partners) with others on the site. This information was then leaked enabling the “cheaters” partners to see what they have been up to. This was obviously disastrous for the online business and its customers. Consumers are also vulnerable to hackers as a business would benefit greatly from information that a hacker could obtain such as personal opinions, or even where they spend their free time (Newe, 2015). In addition if the hackers can get the consumers credit card details the consumer could lose money. This creates a demand for ever increasing sophistication in security services and programmes.

In particular, as the Internet of Things spreads widely, cyber attacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat. If a front door's lock is connected to the Internet, and can be locked/unlocked from a phone, then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone. People could stand to lose much more than their credit card numbers in a world controlled by IoT-enabled devices.  Thieves have also used electronic means to circumvent non-Internet-connected hotel door locks.

81_8	CAR_ca9b6a1f2c4a089ef25403a72739a38401a0c666	Medical devices such as  pacemakers , insulin pumps,  operating room  monitors,  defibrillators , and  surgical instruments , including deep-brain stimulators, can incorporate the ability to transmit vital  health information  from a patient's body to  medical professionals . Some of these devices can be remotely controlled. This has engendered concern about privacy and security issues, human error, and technical glitches with this technology. While only a few studies have looked at the susceptibility of medical devices to hacking, there is a risk.  In 2008, computer scientists proved that pacemakers and defibrillators can be hacked wirelessly via radio hardware, an antenna, and a personal computer. These researchers showed they could shut down a combination heart defibrillator and pacemaker and reprogram it to deliver potentially lethal shocks or run out its battery.  Jay Radcliff, a security researcher interested in the security of medical devices, raised fears about the safety of these devices.  He shared his concerns at the Black Hat security conference. Radcliff fears that the devices are vulnerable and has found that a lethal attack is possible against those with insulin pumps and glucose monitors.  Some medical device makers downplay the threat from such attacks and argue that the demonstrated attacks have been performed by skilled security researchers and are unlikely to occur in the real world.  At the same time, other makers have asked software security experts to investigate the safety of their devices.  As recently as June 2011, security experts showed that by using readily available hardware and a user manual, a scientist could both tap into the information on the system of a wireless insulin pump in combination with a glucose monitor.  With the PIN of the device, the scientist could wirelessly control the dosage of the insulin.  Anand Raghunathan, a researcher in this study, explains that medical devices are getting smaller and lighter so that they can be easily worn. The downside is that additional security features would put an extra strain on the battery and size and drive up prices.  Dr. William Maisel offered some thoughts on the motivation to engage in this activity.  Motivation to do this hacking might include acquisition of private information for financial gain or competitive advantage; damage to a device manufacturer's reputation; sabotage; intent to inflict financial or personal injury or just satisfaction for the attacker.  Researchers suggest a few safeguards.  One would be to use rolling codes.  Another solution is to use a technology called "body-coupled communication" that uses the human skin as a wave guide for wireless communication.

In some cases, the channels do not even have to be from the same television provider, since many providers use similar encryption systems, or use cards which have the capacity to store information for decoding those channels also. The information on how to hack the card is normally held within small, underground groups, to which public access is not possible. Instead, the hacking groups may release their hack in several forms. One such way is simply to release the encryption algorithm and key. Another common release method is by releasing a  computer program  which can be used by the smart card user to reprogram their card. Once complete, the now illegally modified smart card is known as a "MOSC." (Modified Original Smart Card). A third such method, more common in recent times, is to sell the information gained on the encryption to a third party, who will then release their own smart card, such as the K3 card. This third party, for legal reasons, will then use a fourth party to release encrypted files, which then allow the card to decode encrypted content.

The agency commented that the bill has language that may allow GMO material to escape labeling: the bill requires labeling if the food contains “genetic material”, but that may exempt secondary products like oil, starches, sweeteners, or proteins derived from GMO substrates. The agency  questioned the specificity of  the definition of bioengineered food when it would not apply to GMOs that could also be achieved by ‘conventional breeding”. The FDA has also voiced some concerns about food information being presented in electronic codes.

It was enacted on July 29, 2016 when  President Obama  signed then  Senate Bill  764 (S.764). While the law is officially termed A bill to reauthorize and amend the  National Sea Grant College Program  Act, and for other purposes, it evolved over time into "the legislative vehicle for a measure concerning bioengineered food disclosure". The bill was crafted by Sen.  Pat Roberts  (R-KS) and  Debbie Stabenow  (D-MI). The  "GMO labeling bill"  was introduced by its sponsor, Sen.  Roger F. Wicker  (R-MS), cosponsored by Sen.  Dan Sullivan  (R-AK), and  passed Senate and House in June 2016. The law overturned relevant state laws such as Vermont's GMO labeling law that had called for strict and transparent GMO food labeling in Vermont after July 1, 2016.
82_1	CAR_14e62ec6fa1fb134487c7a2ce2a490b937880bb0	Genetically modified organism s (GMO) are  organism s whose  genetic  material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as  recombinant DNA technology . Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause  food safety  and  food labeling  concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the  Biosafety Protocol , regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.

A statewide ballot question that would have mandated labeling of GMO products in California was defeated in 2012. The measure, known as  Proposition 37  was leading by a wide margin in early polling  but was defeated after an advertising blitz bankrolled by Monsanto, the largest supplier of genetically engineered seeds, Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo., and other large food business interests.  The ballot question's results were closely watched across the country as advocates for the measure hoped that it would pass and spur the federal government to mandate labeling of GMO foods as well.  In the wake of the labeling law proposal's defeat, an organization called  March Against Monsanto  was formed to continue to keep alive the public debate about labeling GMO food products. In 2013, a ballot initiative that would have required labels on GMO foods sold in the state of Washington was defeated by voters, again after a campaign against the initiative was led by major food companies.

All food (including  processed food ) or  feed  which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled. As of 2010 GMOs unapproved by the EC had been found twice and returned to their port of origin: First in 2006 when a shipment of rice from the U.S. containing an experimental GMO variety (LLRice601) not meant for commercialisation arrived at  Rotterdam , the second time in 2009, when trace amounts of a GMO maize approved in the US were found in a non-GM soy flour cargo. In 2012, the EU imported about 30 million tons of GM crops for animal consumption.

The original bill S. 764  - “A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes” -  had nothing to do with food and stalled after having passed the Senate. Hollowed out of its content it was replaced with a bill to defund  Planned Parenthood . This bill was then replaced with a bill creating to outlaw state-level GMO labeling and setting a voluntary GMO labeling bill. When this bill failed, the S. 764 husk was used to rush through the present bill, just in time before the Vermont GMO food labeling requirement would have been activated on July 1.

Although labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in many countries, it is not required in the United States and no distinction between marketed GMO and non-GMO foods is recognized by the US FDA. In a May 2014 article in  The Economist  it was argued that, while GM foods could potentially help feed 842 million malnourished people globally, laws such as those being considered by Vermont's governor, Peter Shumlin, to require labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients, could have the unintended consequence of interrupting the process of spreading GM technologies to impoverished countries that suffer with  food security  problems.

Advocates of such labelling claim that the consumer should make the choice whether to expose themselves to any possible  health risk  from consuming such foods.  Detractors point to studies that conclude  genetically modified food  is safe, and point out that for many commodity products, the identity of the grower and the custody chain are not known.
82_2	CAR_11a62de61f9acb61e79afcc17bc051aebeea4f8e	One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. A study investigating voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%. In Canada and the United States labeling of GM food is voluntary, while in Europe all food (including  processed food ) or  feed  which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled. Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Australia require labeling so consumers can exercise choice between foods that have genetically modified, conventional or organic origins.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause  food safety  and  food labeling  concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the  Biosafety Protocol , regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.

The  European Commission  argued that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice, avoid potential  misleading  of consumers and facilitate the withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or the environment are discovered.  A 2007 study on the effect of labeling laws found that once labeling went into effect, few products continued to contain GM ingredients. The study also found that costs were higher in food-exporting than in food-importing countries.

It simply requires labeling of food produced using genetic engineering, so we can choose whether to buy those products or not. We have a right to know."Opponents argued that "Prop. 37 is a deceptive, deeply flawed food labeling scheme, full of special-interest exemptions and loopholes.

Although labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in many countries, it is not required in the United States and no distinction between marketed GMO and non-GMO foods is recognized by the US FDA. In a May 2014 article in  The Economist  it was argued that, while GM foods could potentially help feed 842 million malnourished people globally, laws such as those being considered by Vermont's governor, Peter Shumlin, to require labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients, could have the unintended consequence of interrupting the process of spreading GM technologies to impoverished countries that suffer with  food security  problems.

It can either be qualitative, showing which  genetically modified organism  (GMO) is present, or quantitative, measuring in which amount a certain GMO is present. Being able to detect a GMO is an important part of GMO labeling, as without detection methods the  traceability of GMOs  would rely solely on documentation.

Advocates of such labelling claim that the consumer should make the choice whether to expose themselves to any possible  health risk  from consuming such foods.  Detractors point to studies that conclude  genetically modified food  is safe, and point out that for many commodity products, the identity of the grower and the custody chain are not known.

The  European Commission  argued that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice, avoid potential  misleading  of consumers and facilitate the withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or the environment are discovered.  A 2007 study on the effect of labeling laws found that once labeling went into effect, few products continued to contain GM ingredients.

The compromise chosen by some countries  - notably the European Union - has been to implement regulations specifically governing co-existence and  traceability . Traceability has become commonplace in the food and feed supply chains of most countries in the world, but the traceability of GMOs is made more challenging by the addition of very strict legal thresholds for unwanted mixing.  Within the  European Union , since 2001, conventional and organic food and feedstuffs can contain up to 0.9% of authorised GM material without being labelled GM  (any trace of non-authorised GM products and would cause shipments to be rejected.).

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause  food safety  and  food labeling  concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the  Biosafety Protocol , regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.

All GMOs, along with  irradiated food , are considered "new food" and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science based food evaluation by the  European Food Safety Authority  (EFSA).  The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: "safety," "freedom of choice," "labelling," and "traceability."  The EFSA reports to the  European Commission  who then draft a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and if accepted it will be adopted by the EC or passed on to the  Council of Agricultural Ministers . Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal, if no majority is reached the proposal is passed back to the EC who will then adopt the proposal. However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are "justifiable reasons" that the variety may cause harm to humans or the environment. The member state must then supply sufficient evidence that this is the case.  The Commission is obliged to investigate these cases and either overturn the original registrations or request the country to withdraw its temporary restriction.  The laws of the EU also stipulated that member nations establish coexistence regulations. In many cases national coexistence regulations include  minimum distances between fields of GM crops and non-GM crops. The distances for GM maize from non-GM maize for the six largest biotechnology countries are; France: 50 meters, Britain: 110 meters for grain maize and 80 for silage maize, Netherlands: 25 meters in general and 250 for organic or GM-free fields, Sweden: 15–50 meters, Finland: data not available, and Germany: 150 meters and 300 from organic fields. Larger minimum distance requirements discriminate against adoption of GM crops by smaller farms.

In February 2008, the French government used the safeguard clause to ban the cultivation of  MON 810  after Senator  Jean-François Le Grand , chairman of a committee to evaluate biotechnology, said there were "serious doubts" about the safety of the product. Twelve scientists and two economists on the committee accused Le Grand of misrepresenting the report and said they did not have "serious doubts", although questions remained concerning the impact of Bt-maize on health and the environment. The EFSA reviewed studies the French government had submitted to back up its claim, and concluded that there was no new evidence to undermine its prior safety findings and considered the decision "scientifically unfounded". The  High Council for Biotechnology  subcommittee dealing with economic, ethical and social aspects recommended an additional "GMO-free" label for anything containing less than 0.1% GMO which is due to come in late 2010. In 2011, the  European Court of Justice  and the French  Conseil d'État  ruled that the French farm ministry ban of MON 810 was illegal, as it failed "to give proof of the existence of a particularly high level of risk for the health and the environment".

On the other hand, the United States still takes on a less hands-on approach to the regulation of GMOs, with the FDA and USDA only looking over pesticide and plant health facets of GMOs. Despite the overall global increase in the production in GMOs, the European Union has still stalled GMOs fully integrating into its food supply.

European research programs such as  Co-Extra , Transcontainer, and SIGMEA are investigating appropriate tools and rules for  traceability . The  OECD  has introduced a "unique identifier" which is given to any GMO when it is approved, which must be forwarded at every stage of processing. Such measures are generally not used in North America because they are very costly and the industry admits of no safety-related reasons to employ them.  The EC has issued guidelines to allow the  co-existence of GM and non-GM crops  through buffer zones (where no GM crops are grown).

The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries. In the EU, animals must be tagged with details of their origin and stamped with the traceability code of the abattoir when slaughtered. The tools used may vary from one country to another and can include ear tags, passports and bar codes, but must carry the same information.
82_5	CAR_13c9e6746b3b17f354633aafb3404d8ce56943ed	Many consumers are critical of genetically modified plants and their products, while, conversely, most experts in charge of GMO approvals do not perceive concrete threats to health or the environment. The compromise chosen by some countries  - notably the European Union - has been to implement regulations specifically governing co-existence and  traceability . Traceability has become commonplace in the food and feed supply chains of most countries in the world, but the traceability of GMOs is made more challenging by the addition of very strict legal thresholds for unwanted mixing.  Within the  European Union , since 2001, conventional and organic food and feedstuffs can contain up to 0.9% of authorised GM material without being labelled GM  (any trace of non-authorised GM products and would cause shipments to be rejected.).
82_5	CAR_1753b9b0cff473423fdf8789002c1dde4fecc9b9	The unique identifier has been integrated in the  Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety  and in the  European Union  legislation on the labelling and traceability of genetically modified organisms (Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003). Detailing the unique identifier, the regulation demands the forwarding of written documentation of the identity of a GMO at every stage of the production process. This allows a GMO to be traced even if, for example, due to intensive processing, it can no longer be detected. Using this unique identifier, information on all approved transgenic GMOs is accessible through the  Biosafety Clearing-House , the information exchange platform of the Cartagena Protocol.
82_5	CAR_1d7865d754d5fe2d722170f73ee1b9e23e6e297b	In food processing software, traceability systems imply the use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number, generally through the use of a  barcode  /  RFID ) which can be traced through the entire production flow, linking all sections of the business, including suppliers & future sales through the supply chain.  Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability software to find the particular transaction and/or product within the supply chain.

82_5	CAR_21a81b158dcb8dca692a2b0d91161f7b4b03b7e0	In May 2003, the US and twelve other countries filed a formal complaint with the  World Trade Organization  that the EU was violating international trade agreements, by blocking imports of US farm products through its ban on GM food. The countries argued that the EU's regulatory process was far too slow and its standards were unreasonable given the scientific evidence showing that the crops were safe. The case was lobbied by  Monsanto  and France's  Aventis , as well as by US agricultural groups such as the  National Corn Growers Association . In response, in June 2003, the  European Parliament  ratified a  U.N.   biosafety protocol  regulating international trade in GM food, and in July agreed to new regulations requiring labeling and traceability, as well as an opt-out provision for individual countries. The approval of new GMOs resumed in May 2004. While GMOs have been approved since then, approvals remain controversial and various countries have utilized opt-out provisions. In 2006, the World Trade Organization ruled that the pre-2004 restrictions had been violations, although the ruling had little immediate effect since the moratorium had already been lifted.

82_5	CAR_4df8d4a836a0bf30c6e3114533706f4ff8a6d91f	Those new laws provided the  European Union  (EU) with possibly the most stringent GMO regulations in the world. All GMOs, along with  irradiated food , are considered "new food" and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science based food evaluation by the  European Food Safety Authority  (EFSA).  The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: "safety," "freedom of choice," "labelling," and "traceability."  The EFSA reports to the  European Commission  who then draft a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and if accepted it will be adopted by the EC or passed on to the  Council of Agricultural Ministers . Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal, if no majority is reached the proposal is passed back to the EC who will then adopt the proposal. However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are "justifiable reasons" that the variety may cause harm to humans or the environment. The member state must then supply sufficient evidence that this is the case.  The Commission is obliged to investigate these cases and either overturn the original registrations or request the country to withdraw its temporary restriction.  The laws of the EU also stipulated that member nations establish coexistence regulations. In many cases national coexistence regulations include  minimum distances between fields of GM crops and non-GM crops. The distances for GM maize from non-GM maize for the six largest biotechnology countries are; France: 50 meters, Britain: 110 meters for grain maize and 80 for silage maize, Netherlands: 25 meters in general and 250 for organic or GM-free fields, Sweden: 15–50 meters, Finland: data not available, and Germany: 150 meters and 300 from organic fields. Larger minimum distance requirements discriminate against adoption of GM crops by smaller farms.

The  European Commission  argued that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice, avoid potential  misleading  of consumers and facilitate the withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or the environment are discovered.  A 2007 study on the effect of labeling laws found that once labeling went into effect, few products continued to contain GM ingredients. The study also found that costs were higher in food-exporting than in food-importing countries.

The EU introduced its Trade Control and Expert System, or  TRACES , in April 2004. The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries. Australia has its  National Livestock Identification System  to keep track of livestock from birth to slaughterhouse.
82_5	CAR_77c137a8880390f598261d1af5ac8f5fb832d87e	In  food processing  ( meat processing , fresh produce processing), the term traceability refers to the recording through means of barcodes or RFID tags & other tracking media, all movement of product and steps within the production process. One of the key reasons this is such a critical point is in instances where an issue of contamination arises, and a recall is required. Where traceability has been closely adhered to, it is possible to identify, by precise date/time & exact location which goods must be recalled, and which are safe, potentially saving millions of dollars in the recall process. Traceability within the food processing industry is also utilised to identify key high production & quality areas of a business, versus those of low return, and where points in the production process may be improved.

By biochemical means ( polymerase chain reaction ) even tiny traces of GMOs can be detected and identified—provided that suitable testing tools exist for the GMO assumed to be present. In the EU, such a tool must be part of the application documents for the approval for commercialisation.

Due to high demand from European consumers for freedom of choice between GM and non-GM foods. EU regulations require measures to avoid mixing of foods and feed produced from GM crops and conventional or organic crops, which can be done via  isolation distances  or  biological containment  strategies.  (Unlike the US, European countries require labeling of GM food.)  European research programs such as  Co-Extra , Transcontainer, and SIGMEA are investigating appropriate tools and rules for  traceability . The  OECD  has introduced a "unique identifier" which is given to any GMO when it is approved, which must be forwarded at every stage of processing. Such measures are generally not used in North America because they are very costly and the industry admits of no safety-related reasons to employ them.  The EC has issued guidelines to allow the  co-existence of GM and non-GM crops  through buffer zones (where no GM crops are grown). These are regulated by individual countries and vary from 15 meters in Sweden to 800 meters in Luxembourg. All food (including  processed food ) or  feed  which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.

Researchers are investigating methods either to prevent GM crops from producing pollen at all (for example  male-sterile plants ), or to develop GM crops with pollen that nonetheless does not contain the additional, genetically engineered material. In an example of the latter,  transplastomic plants  can be generated in which the genetic modification has been integrated in the DNA of  chloroplasts  - the cell nucleus contains no transgenes and thus the pollen contains no chloroplasts and thus no transgenes. Two important research projects on co-existence are and  Co-Extra . With the end of the de facto moratorium on genetically modified plants in Europe, several research programmes (e.g.  SIGMEA ,  Co-Extra , and  Transcontainer ) have begun investigating biological containment strategies for GMOs.
82_6	CAR_5ec97f5bb36766ccac7617b4461075adea603c35	Currently, it is highly unlikely that the presence of unexpected or even unknown GMOs will be detected, since either the DNA sequence of the transgene or its product, the protein, must be known for detection. In addition, even testing for known GMOs is time-consuming and costly, as current reliable detection methods can test for only one GMO at a time. Therefore, research programmes such as  Co-Extra  are developing improved and alternative testing methods, for example  DNA microarray s.

Research is now underway to develop multiplex PCR methods that can simultaneously detect many different transgenic lines. Another major challenge is the increasing prevalence of transgenic crops with  stacked traits . This refers to transgenic cultivars derived from crosses between transgenic parent lines, combining the transgenic traits of both parents. One GM maize variety now awaiting a decision by the European Commission,  MON863  x  MON810  x  NK603 , has three stacked traits. It is resistant to an herbicide and to two different kinds of insect pests. Some combined testing methods could give results that would triple the actual GM content of a sample containing this GMO.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause  food safety  and  food labeling  concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the  Biosafety Protocol , regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.

82_7	CAR_53aa669da60357416a274819ceebabe1ccf8dd3c	Founded in 2005, the Non-GMO Project's mission is "to preserve and build sources of non-GMO products, educate consumers, and provide verified non-GMO choices". It's third party verification and labeling for non-GMO food and products. They also work with food manufacturers, distributors, growers, and seed suppliers to develop standards for detection of GMOs and for the reduction of contamination risk of the non-GMO food supply with GMOs. FoodChain Global Advisors, a part of  Global ID Group, provides the technical capabilities.

DNA based detection looks for a part of the foreign DNA inserted in a GMO. For technical reasons, certain DNA sequences are shared by several GMOs. Protein-based methods detect the product of the transgene, for example the  Bt toxin . Since different GMOs may produce the same protein, construct-specific detection can test a sample for several GMOs in one step, but is unable to tell precisely which of the similar GMOs are present. Especially in the USA, protein-based detection is used for the construct-specific approach.
82_7	CAR_5993c5fb59f434f68eb6a470e15a3bc2f2a9ece3	In 1997, an independent test by the  New York Times  looking for traces of  GMO s in 11 soy and corn-based products found Eden's milk to be the only product that tested clean, a finding that Eden Foods attributed to their extensive certification and testing program.
82_7	CAR_5ec97f5bb36766ccac7617b4461075adea603c35	Currently, it is highly unlikely that the presence of unexpected or even unknown GMOs will be detected, since either the DNA sequence of the transgene or its product, the protein, must be known for detection. In addition, even testing for known GMOs is time-consuming and costly, as current reliable detection methods can test for only one GMO at a time. Therefore, research programmes such as  Co-Extra  are developing improved and alternative testing methods, for example  DNA microarray s.
82_7	CAR_5f09f5da8af05523da3af51553191d7dbf4fff51	Whether or not a GMO is present in a sample can be tested by Q-PCR, but also by  multiplex PCR . Multiplex PCR uses multiple, unique primer sets within a single PCR reaction to produce amplicons of varying sizes specific to different DNA sequences, i.e. different transgenes. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and  amplicon  sizes, i.e., their  base pair  length, should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by  gel electrophoresis .

The database also stores pertinent information on the food item, such as labels, suppliers, expiration dates, and pricing, which is cataloged for manufacturers to make use of. Food manufacturers can send samples of their products, where individual  DNA barcode  regions are identified for each component of the food. The genetic codes are then compared with similar sequences in their DNA database, which can reveal the presence of GMOs, pathogens, and contaminants.

This helps verify GMO-free labeling and address health risks for those with allergens. The process starts with DNA extraction to detect GMO traces, which are then tested for quality and finally assigned a rank within the database.

At the request of the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning in 2002 was a study on biosafety by the Head of the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, in which extensive modifications were made possible, the manner of their creation, the levels of security depending on the type of modification of the organism in which it is created and the then state of the field in Macedonia.In cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency since early 2005, Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food participated in a project titled "Improving the system of food safety in the Republic of Macedonia", which is focused on establishing system to control the presence of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in various types of food products. In June 2005, the laboratory was equipped with an automatic DNA analyzer, Real-time PCR and a new camera for documentation of the gels. Within this project were made and training of team members at the Institute for the Control of Foodstuffs in Lower Saxony, Department of Genetic Engineering and Laboratory for GMO control at the National Institute of Biology in Ljubljana, Slovenia, two renowned institutions the field of GMOs. This project was entirely funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency for a total of about 250,000 Euros.Ministry of Health, which includes a Directorate for Food, issued in 2006 authorizing the Laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and GM at the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Food for the control of GMOs in different foodstuffs. Except for routine laboratory analysis and actively participate in the development of professional tests organized by the ISTA (International Seed Testing Association) proving the competence of staff and quality equipment that performed the analysis. But during the analysis down to a small percentage of GMO present in a nutritional product, there are many critical points that can lead to unrealistic results. The laboratory used different measures in order to maximally avoid these critical points. However, the rapid development of analytical techniques today shows that there are alternative methods that are far faster and have greater accuracy in terms of ever used. Moreover, the application of such methods in most cases shortens the time for analysis by reducing the procedures and thus the price of each copy skriniranje drastically decline.Except in the field of GM laboratory participated in the implementation of other projects in the field of genetic engineering and biotechnology. Because of their number on this occasion would only mentions: project "Application of molecular marker for stress syndrome in selection of pigs," project "Application of molecular markers for dairy proteins (κ-casein and β-aktoglobulin) in selection of dairy cows and sheep, an international project entitled "Identification and conservation of animal genetic resources in Southeastern Europe", financed by the Agricultural Faculty in Oslo, Norway and the project proposal TSE genotyping and breeding program in small ruminants in the Republic of Macedonia ".

They have expressed concerns about the objectivity of regulators and rigor of the regulatory process, about contamination of the non-GM food supply, about effects of GMOs on the environment and nature, and about the consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs.
82_7	CAR_943965c65d2c47f4ccf89e7d9baf7bd010535d33	In the U.S., three government organizations regulate GMOs. The  FDA  checks the chemical composition of  organisms for potential  allergens . The  United States Department of Agriculture  (USDA) supervises field testing and monitors the distribution of GM seeds. The  United States Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) is responsible for monitoring pesticide usage, including plants modified to contain proteins toxic to insects. Like USDA, EPA also oversees field testing and the distribution of crops that have had contact with pesticides to ensure environmental safety. In 2015 the Obama administration announced that it would update the way the government regulated GM crops.
82_7	CAR_a823bf4e7fea397136b4b406f318414d94a110e1	The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use  substantial equivalence  to determine if further testing is required, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China only authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis.  In the U.S. the FDA determined that GMO's are " Generally Recognized as Safe " (GRAS) and therefore do not require additional testing if the GMO product is substantially equivalent to the non-modified product.  If new substances are found, further testing may be required to satisfy concerns over potential toxicity, allergenicity, possible gene transfer to humans or genetic outcrossing to other organisms.
82_7	CAR_b2b002496633abf60fbce266f705d1903b204a8e	Consensus among scientists and regulators pointed to the need for improved testing technologies and protocols.  Transgenic  and  cisgenic  organisms are treated similarly when assessed. However, in 2012 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) GMO Panel said that "novel hazards" could be associated with transgenic strains. In a 2016 review, Domingo concluded that studies in recent years had established that GM soybeans, rice, corn, and wheat do not differ from the corresponding conventional crops in terms of short-term human health effects, but recommended that further studies of long-term effects be conducted.

82_7	CAR_e134a98652b4935b8f13591fad796ff746095331	The method works by pairing the targeted genetic sequence with custom designed complementary bits of DNA called  primers . In the presence of the target sequence, the primers match with it and trigger a chain reaction. DNA replication enzymes use the primers as docking points and start doubling the target sequences. The process is repeated over and over again by sequential heating and cooling until doubling and redoubling has multiplied the target sequence several million-fold. The millions of identical fragments are then purified in a slab of gel, dyed, and can be seen with UV light. It is not prone to contamination. Irrespective of the variety of methods used for DNA analysis, only PCR in its different formats has been widely applied in GMO detection/analysis and generally accepted for regulatory compliance purposes. Detection methods based on DNA rely on the complementarity of two strands of DNA double helix that hybridize in a sequence-specific manner. The DNA of GMO consists of several elements that govern its functioning. The elements are promoter sequence, structural gene and stop sequence for the gene.
82_7	CAR_ef1121e0a382dca7bffdf33a03ed9e9657fe65f4	Traceability does not rely solely on documentation. By biochemical means ( polymerase chain reaction ) even tiny traces of GMOs can be detected and identified—provided that suitable testing tools exist for the GMO assumed to be present. In the EU, such a tool must be part of the application documents for the approval for commercialisation. For most products and production stages, testing methods are available to monitor and enforce the compliance with traceability regulations.
82_7	CAR_f623d3242c208ddd2671b53ffb56d657dc190ce3	The detection of genetically modified organisms in food or feed is possible by biochemical means. It can either be qualitative, showing which  genetically modified organism  (GMO) is present, or quantitative, measuring in which amount a certain GMO is present. Being able to detect a GMO is an important part of GMO labeling, as without detection methods the  traceability of GMOs  would rely solely on documentation.

There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. The European Union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the EU and approval for import and processing. While only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing. The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about coexistence of GM and nonGM crops. Depending on the coexistence regulations, incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ.
82_8	CAR_13c9e6746b3b17f354633aafb3404d8ce56943ed	Many consumers are critical of genetically modified plants and their products, while, conversely, most experts in charge of GMO approvals do not perceive concrete threats to health or the environment. The compromise chosen by some countries  - notably the European Union - has been to implement regulations specifically governing co-existence and  traceability . Traceability has become commonplace in the food and feed supply chains of most countries in the world, but the traceability of GMOs is made more challenging by the addition of very strict legal thresholds for unwanted mixing.  Within the  European Union , since 2001, conventional and organic food and feedstuffs can contain up to 0.9% of authorised GM material without being labelled GM  (any trace of non-authorised GM products and would cause shipments to be rejected.).

Concerns center on both food safety and the erosion of agricultural biodiversity.  While the European Union regulates genetically engineered foods as they would any other new product requiring extensive testing to provide it is safe for human consumption, the U.S. does not. The Food and Drug Administration generally considers a food with origins from genetically modified organisms (GMO) to be as safe as its conventional counterpart.  Numerous studies have backed industry claims that GMO foods appear to be safe for human consumption, including an examination of more than 130 research projects conducted in the European Union prior to 2010 and work published by the American Medical Association's Council on Science and Public Health.

The EU has been under domestic pressure to restrict the growth and import of  genetically modified foods  until their safety is proven to the satisfaction of the populace. On the other hand, the United States is under pressure from its agricultural businesses to force the EU to accept imports, seeing the EU's restrictions as alarmist and protectionist.

Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use  substantial equivalence  as the starting point when assessing safety, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis.  Many countries allow the import of GM food with authorization, but either do not allow its cultivation (Russia, Norway, Israel) or have provisions for cultivation, but no GM products are yet produced (Japan, South Korea).  Most countries that do not allow for GMO cultivation do permit research.
82_8	CAR_7c2fcb9edebb92e131fad5241c0630399d3a1884	The European Union has heavily contrasted its regulations and restrictions regarding genetic engineering compared to those of the United States. The European Parliament's Committee on the Environmental, Public Health, and Consumer Protection pushed forward and adopted a "safety first" principle regarding the case of GMOs, calling for any negative health consequences from GMOs to be held liable. On the other hand, the United States still takes on a less hands-on approach to the regulation of GMOs, with the FDA and USDA only looking over pesticide and plant health facets of GMOs. Despite the overall global increase in the production in GMOs, the European Union has still stalled GMOs fully integrating into its food supply. This has definitely affected various countries, including the United States, when trading with the EU.

Marked differences distinguish the US from Europe. Crops not intended as foods are generally not reviewed for food safety. GM foods are not tested in humans before marketing because they are not a single chemical, nor are they intended to be ingested using specific doses and intervals, which complicate  clinical study  design. Regulators examine the genetic modification, related protein products and any changes that those proteins make to the food.

82_8	CAR_ef401a18f4f95523ee060e42b474d433f61b6cad	The  coexistence  has raised significant concern in many European countries and so EU law also requires that all GM food be traceable to its origin, and that all food with GM content greater than 0.9% be labelled.  Due to high demand from European consumers for freedom of choice between GM and non-GM foods. EU regulations require measures to avoid mixing of foods and feed produced from GM crops and conventional or organic crops, which can be done via  isolation distances  or  biological containment  strategies.  (Unlike the US, European countries require labeling of GM food.)  European research programs such as  Co-Extra , Transcontainer, and SIGMEA are investigating appropriate tools and rules for  traceability . The  OECD  has introduced a "unique identifier" which is given to any GMO when it is approved, which must be forwarded at every stage of processing. Such measures are generally not used in North America because they are very costly and the industry admits of no safety-related reasons to employ them.  The EC has issued guidelines to allow the  co-existence of GM and non-GM crops  through buffer zones (where no GM crops are grown). These are regulated by individual countries and vary from 15 meters in Sweden to 800 meters in Luxembourg. All food (including  processed food ) or  feed  which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.
82_8	CAR_f44b3e532f818ccad971a360fdb5de3a41cb4243	The approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of  genetic engineering  technology and the development and release of  genetically modified organisms  (GMOs) vary from country to country, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the United States and Europe. The U.S. regulatory policy is governed by the  Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology  The policy has three tenets:  "(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of genetic modification (GM) techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products."  European Union  by contrast enacted  regulatory laws in 2003 that provided possibly the most stringent GMO regulations in the world. All GMOs, along with  irradiated food , are considered "new food" and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the  European Food Safety Authority  (EFSA).  The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: "safety," "freedom of choice," "labelling," and "traceability."
82_8	MARCO_4027034	One key area where the US and EU differ is genetically modified foods. The EU has some of the strictest GM regulations in the world and has authorised just 52 GM foods to date. The US, on the other hand, is the largest commercial grower of GM crops in the world. There is also concern that US producers will be able to sell their meat in European markets, even though it is produced to different standards.
82_8	MARCO_6858676	The regulatory approach used in Europe requires new and separate laws that are specific to genetically engineered (âGMOâ) foods and crops. By contrast, the United States regulates GMOs for food safety and for environmental safety using the laws that were already in place to govern non-GMO foods and crops. â¢
82_8	MARCO_8273445	These differences, which grow out of variations in political, economic, and cultural characteristics, have raised challenges for trade, agricultural, and consumer policy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the underlying factors that have contributed to divergent U.S. and European views on GMOs. After a brief overview of the historical and cultural differences dividing U.S. and EU attitudes, we focus primarily on consumer labelling strategies and international trade.

82_9	CAR_01261fc64032615f50930b35a170b8346a77ad18	Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) is used to measure the quantity of a PCR product (preferably real-time, QRT-PCR). It is the method of choice to quantitatively measure amounts of  transgene  DNA in a food or feed sample. Q-PCR is commonly used to determine whether a DNA sequence is present in a sample and the number of its copies in the sample. The method with currently the highest level of accuracy is quantitative real-time PCR. QRT-PCR methods use fluorescent dyes, such as Sybr Green, or fluorophore-containing DNA probes, such as  TaqMan , to measure the amount of amplified product in real time. If the targeted genetic sequence is unique to a certain GMO, a positive PCR test proves that the GMO is present in the sample.

Clear Labs markets their services to manufacturers who want to assess the quality of their supply in terms of accurate labeling, genetically modified organisms ( GMO ) traces, pathogen contamination, and allergens. Clear Labs was accredited by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) in 2005, and the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) in 2016, meeting international standards in biological testing. The company employs a team of 15 as of April 2016.

It also allows for sharing of assessments of low-level GMO contamination (LLP, low-level presence). 
82_9	CAR_353921d2c03d87c16645cc856d51c6e8e3848007	qPCR using reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) can be used to detect  GMO s given its sensitivity and dynamic range in detecting DNA. Alternatives such as DNA or protein analysis are usually less sensitive. Specific primers are used that amplify not the transgene but the  promoter ,  terminator  or even intermediate sequences used during the process of engineering the vector. As the process of creating a transgenic plant normally leads to the insertion of more than one copy of the transgene its quantity is also commonly assessed. This is often carried out by relative quantification using a control gene from the treated species that is only present as a single copy.
82_9	CAR_365c71f9c660ddec1d2d94a0611e6e8450e0e713	This food traceability system uses DNA sampling to track product through the entire supply chain from each individual animal. Until now,  Track and trace  systems have provided the highest level of transparency about product. DNA analysis has become the next step in providing retailers and processors with assurances about origin and product claims.
82_9	CAR_5669ae19c48aee4d3cb399c9fac8fb123be5aa7e	The construct-specific detection methods can either be DNA or  protein  based. DNA based detection looks for a part of the foreign DNA inserted in a GMO. For technical reasons, certain DNA sequences are shared by several GMOs. Protein-based methods detect the product of the transgene, for example the  Bt toxin . Since different GMOs may produce the same protein, construct-specific detection can test a sample for several GMOs in one step, but is unable to tell precisely which of the similar GMOs are present. Especially in the USA, protein-based detection is used for the construct-specific approach.
82_9	CAR_5ec97f5bb36766ccac7617b4461075adea603c35	Currently, it is highly unlikely that the presence of unexpected or even unknown GMOs will be detected, since either the DNA sequence of the transgene or its product, the protein, must be known for detection. In addition, even testing for known GMOs is time-consuming and costly, as current reliable detection methods can test for only one GMO at a time. Therefore, research programmes such as  Co-Extra  are developing improved and alternative testing methods, for example  DNA microarray s.
82_9	CAR_5f09f5da8af05523da3af51553191d7dbf4fff51	Whether or not a GMO is present in a sample can be tested by Q-PCR, but also by  multiplex PCR . Multiplex PCR uses multiple, unique primer sets within a single PCR reaction to produce amplicons of varying sizes specific to different DNA sequences, i.e. different transgenes. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and  amplicon  sizes, i.e., their  base pair  length, should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by  gel electrophoresis .
82_9	CAR_683a5f05be48eb4e51df854841d4c60fc6d0c6d1	An event-specific detection searches for the presence of a DNA sequence unique to a certain GMO, usually the junction between the transgene and the organism's original DNA. This approach is ideal to precisely identify a GMO, yet highly similar GMOs will pass completely unnoticed. Event-specific detection is PCR-based.
82_9	CAR_74d1183f157062175b71e534e2b4a17aa3ccd191	Researchers at Clear Labs use  DNA barcoding  to identify the DNA sequence of individual food samples and record it in their proprietary database for future use. The database also stores pertinent information on the food item, such as labels, suppliers, expiration dates, and pricing, which is cataloged for manufacturers to make use of. Food manufacturers can send samples of their products, where individual  DNA barcode  regions are identified for each component of the food. The genetic codes are then compared with similar sequences in their DNA database, which can reveal the presence of GMOs, pathogens, and contaminants.
82_9	CAR_7d210c088f292749ee9580775b4f6ef96c96ce8b	In 2014 a panel of experts set up by the UK  Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  argued that "A regulatory system based on the characteristics of a novel crop, by whatever method it has been produced, would provide a more effective and robust regulation than current EU processes , which consider new crop varieties differently depending on the method used to produce them." They said that new forms of "genome editing" allow targeting specific sites and making precise changes in the DNA of crops. In the future it would become increasingly difficult if not impossible to tell which method has been used (conventional breeding or genetic engineering) to produce a novel crop. They proposed that existing EU regulatory system should be replaced with a more logical system like that used for new medicines.
82_9	CAR_7dc309882a647d5d1f9d2545979314c2f99f9c35	Two evaluations, Comprehensive GMO Screen and Crop-specific Deep GMO Test are offered, which help food manufacturers to determine if there are any genetically modified components in their food products. This helps verify GMO-free labeling and address health risks for those with allergens. The process starts with DNA extraction to detect GMO traces, which are then tested for quality and finally assigned a rank within the database.

82_9	CAR_d0ee16f93408feddc1dbd5bfb58a7a2747609b57	Almost all transgenic plants contain a few common building blocks that make unknown GMOs easier to find. Even though detecting a novel gene in a GMO can be like finding a needle in a haystack, the fact that the needles are usually similar makes it much easier. To trigger gene expression, scientists couple the gene they want to add with what is known as a  transcription promoter . The high-performing 35S promoter is a common feature to many GMOs. In addition, the stop signal for gene transcription in most GMOs is often the same: the NOS  terminator . Researchers now compile a set of genetic sequences characteristic of GMOs. After genetic elements characteristic of GMOs are selected, methods and tools are developed for detecting them in test samples. Approaches being considered include microarrays and anchor PCR profiling.
82_9	CAR_e134a98652b4935b8f13591fad796ff746095331	The method works by pairing the targeted genetic sequence with custom designed complementary bits of DNA called  primers . In the presence of the target sequence, the primers match with it and trigger a chain reaction. DNA replication enzymes use the primers as docking points and start doubling the target sequences. The process is repeated over and over again by sequential heating and cooling until doubling and redoubling has multiplied the target sequence several million-fold. The millions of identical fragments are then purified in a slab of gel, dyed, and can be seen with UV light. It is not prone to contamination. Irrespective of the variety of methods used for DNA analysis, only PCR in its different formats has been widely applied in GMO detection/analysis and generally accepted for regulatory compliance purposes. Detection methods based on DNA rely on the complementarity of two strands of DNA double helix that hybridize in a sequence-specific manner. The DNA of GMO consists of several elements that govern its functioning. The elements are promoter sequence, structural gene and stop sequence for the gene.
82_9	CAR_ef1121e0a382dca7bffdf33a03ed9e9657fe65f4	Traceability does not rely solely on documentation. By biochemical means ( polymerase chain reaction ) even tiny traces of GMOs can be detected and identified—provided that suitable testing tools exist for the GMO assumed to be present. In the EU, such a tool must be part of the application documents for the approval for commercialisation. For most products and production stages, testing methods are available to monitor and enforce the compliance with traceability regulations.
82_9	CAR_f623d3242c208ddd2671b53ffb56d657dc190ce3	The detection of genetically modified organisms in food or feed is possible by biochemical means. It can either be qualitative, showing which  genetically modified organism  (GMO) is present, or quantitative, measuring in which amount a certain GMO is present. Being able to detect a GMO is an important part of GMO labeling, as without detection methods the  traceability of GMOs  would rely solely on documentation.
82_9	CAR_fa6845f7274f80985362fd9bbe9895e92a55189a	Improving PCR based detection of GMOs is a further goal of the European research programme Co-Extra. Research is now underway to develop multiplex PCR methods that can simultaneously detect many different transgenic lines. Another major challenge is the increasing prevalence of transgenic crops with  stacked traits . This refers to transgenic cultivars derived from crosses between transgenic parent lines, combining the transgenic traits of both parents. One GM maize variety now awaiting a decision by the European Commission,  MON863  x  MON810  x  NK603 , has three stacked traits. It is resistant to an herbicide and to two different kinds of insect pests. Some combined testing methods could give results that would triple the actual GM content of a sample containing this GMO.
82_9	MARCO_480559	Genetic modification involves insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a normal cell where it integrates with the host DNA. Genetic analysis uses molecular techniques to detect the inserted transgenic DNA (GMO) in a sample. The method most commonly used for this purpose is PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). The PCR technique amplifies (copies) the DNA billions of times in order for detection and quantitation to be possible.
82_9	MARCO_480560	Primers bind to an area of the DNA near or within the GMO sequence such that only this area of the DNA genome is amplified. Because the primers are specific to the transgenic DNA sequence and because the DNA is amplified many billion-fold in this process, PCR is a highly sensitive and specific GMO detection method. There are various ways to detect GM DNA in a sample, based on the structure of the foreign DNA sequence, or transgene.

82_9	MARCO_6753957	Types of GMOs. GMO varieties exist for crops such as alfalfa, canola, corn, cotton, papaya, rice, soybean, sugar beet, summer squash, and tobacco. Currently, 95% of U.S. soybean and 90% of U.S. corn is genetically modified.MO varieties of each crop may contain one or more of these events through a process known as gene stacking. GMO testing involves identification of a defined portion of the relevant genetic element (transgene) inserted in order to confer a new trait on the plant.
82_10	CAR_1dfebcaadf2e2abbb4a84b141755d0601a8edcf0	In addition to agricultural measures, there may be also biological tools to prevent the genetically modified crop from fertilising conventional fields. Researchers are investigating methods either to prevent GM crops from producing pollen at all (for example  male-sterile plants ), or to develop GM crops with pollen that nonetheless does not contain the additional, genetically engineered material. In an example of the latter,  transplastomic plants  can be generated in which the genetic modification has been integrated in the DNA of  chloroplasts  - the cell nucleus contains no transgenes and thus the pollen contains no chloroplasts and thus no transgenes. Two important research projects on co-existence are and  Co-Extra . With the end of the de facto moratorium on genetically modified plants in Europe, several research programmes (e.g.  SIGMEA ,  Co-Extra , and  Transcontainer ) have begun investigating biological containment strategies for GMOs.

Towards such safety, a major hurdle is posed by the potential  outcrossing  of the  transgene  via pollen movement. Plastid transformation, which yields transplastomic plants in which the pollen does not contain the transgene, not only increases biosafety, but also facilitates the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic agriculture. Therefore, developing such crops is a major goal of research projects such as  Co-Extra  and Transcontainer.
82_10	CAR_b2b002496633abf60fbce266f705d1903b204a8e	Consensus among scientists and regulators pointed to the need for improved testing technologies and protocols.  Transgenic  and  cisgenic  organisms are treated similarly when assessed. However, in 2012 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) GMO Panel said that "novel hazards" could be associated with transgenic strains. In a 2016 review, Domingo concluded that studies in recent years had established that GM soybeans, rice, corn, and wheat do not differ from the corresponding conventional crops in terms of short-term human health effects, but recommended that further studies of long-term effects be conducted.

However, preliminary results from  Co-Extra , a current project within the EU research program, show that although cleistogamy reduces gene flow, it is not at the moment a consistently reliable tool for  biocontainment ; due to a certain instability of the cleistogamous trait, some flowers may open and release genetically modified pollen.
83_1	CAR_23c3b79994286a1b89dbc6cf83c1c4687a024955	Bumble bees are generally host to a diversity of  parasitoids  in which the larvae grows inside the living host. The majority of parasitoids for bumble bees are flies and about 30 percent or more bees within the area can be infected. The process of parasitism consists of the fly attaching to the bee in flight and inserting her oviposits between the terga of the bee. The larval fly hatches within the bee host and develops by feeding on the host’s tissues. The bee lives for about two weeks before dying. The fly then pupates and spends the winter inside the bee, fully developed, before it emerges the following year. North American bumblebees are also hosted by one parasitoid wasp and the moth, B. variabilis.  Hibernating queen bumble bees are parasitized by a nematode worm,  Sphaerularia bombi . This parasite does not reduce life span, but instead causes the sterilization of the queen. It has been observed that affected queens forage two to three weeks later than those that are unaffected.  Parasitic microorganisms also use bees as their host. Parasitic microorganisms’ effects may be lethal or sublethal. Pathogens may be transmitted within a colony or the bee may be infected at flowers. Tracheal mites ( Locustacarus buchneri ) leads to reduced foraging efficiency by living in the bee’s alveoli. Certain protozoans and fungi consume the host tissue or gut substances of the bumble bee’s digestive tract, decreasing foraging efficiency, life span, and thus the colony fitness. Bees may contain symbiotic bacteria that offer some immunity to pathogens. Further exposure to habitat loss as well as pesticide exposure may lead to bee predisposition, thus promoting the species’ decay.
83_1	CAR_551d8a007a54f896eecf91b15605a6955ee10021	This bee is a very important part of pollination. For many species of plant, such as species of Viscaria, only bees and butterflies have proboscides long enough to pollinate effectively. For example, studies show B. lapidarius was more numerous and had a higher feeding density than other species studied. Further, Bombus lapidarius is important in pollinating many other species, including Centaurea scabiosa. A study found that though Apis mellifera was also involved in pollination of this species, B. lapidarius greatly outnumbers Apis and other bee species in number and importance in pollination. Though initially attracted to flowers by the color, the scent is what drives attention as the bees approach flowers. it has been suggested that some individuals are better able to interpret differences in scent in the flowers than others. It has been suggested that these differences in ability developed evolutionarily as different types of bees developed specific roles within the colony. How long a bee stays at a particular flower seems to be connected to behavior, as it appeared the bees assumed low pollen reward, despite increased pollen levels in experiments. However, the amount of pollen transferred in a visit from B. lapidarius was only affected by the amount of pollen in the flower that individual was at. Further, it appeared that variation in duration of visits to different flowers was related to differences in foraging speed, not differences in how well the bee was able to remove nectar. Bees will typically forage in patches, but show no clear directionality in their foraging. Further, pollinating bees will usually visit the nearest neighboring plants, thus gene flow between plants tends to be pretty limited. Other experiments also indicated that body size is an important factor in how bumblebees pollinate. It would appear that size affects how often the bee will visit flowers as well as how well the bee could pollinate. Smaller bees seem to pollinate more effectively than larger bees. Yet, there did not appear to be a correlation between floral display size and body size. Therefore, it was suggested that bumblebees of all different sizes respond in the same way to floral display size.
83_1	CAR_601a5df8ba2422e5556ef039cb5f502f60eed1ad	Carpenter bees pollinate  passionflower  both in their native habitats and in commercial settings. Interestingly, they provide better pollination than honey bees for the passionflower. For some species, their foraging activity led to an increase in tomato weight by 10% relative to a combination of wind and insect pollination. This efficiency of pollination by the carpenter bees in pollinating tomatoes is drastically improved by their ability to buzz the anthers, which is unique to the Carpenter bees. In a study done in Israel, honeydew melons pollinated by  X. pubescens , relative of X. varipuncta, was three times higher compared to honey bee pollination. As a result, one can clearly see the importance these bees can have commercially in producing better fruits as well. Carpenter bees are important pollinators of cotton in Pakistan, India, and Egypt as well. X. varipuncta is compared favorably with honey bees as pollinators of cotton in field cages in the United States.
83_1	CAR_63a2d2397b22e8ee92ccf2dcaae92012a6f99c24	The sweat bee has a simple nesting architecture consisting of a vertical tunnel into the ground ending in a compartment reserved for brood-rearing. They nest underground, like  Lasioglossum zephyrum , but they do not form the same complex structures. Nest entrances are frequently concealed using scattered foliage. For L. malachurum, thousands of nests can be found located within a small region in nesting aggregations, which suggests that the bees likely have some sort of identification mechanism for their own specific nests. In fact, nest entrances and brood cell linings are both impregnated with secretions from the  Dufour's gland  of the bee, which plays a role in nest orientation. Nests are dug into hard, compact soil and can be sealed from within by the queen using her abdomen. Because nests are dug into hard soil, construction of a nest represents a significant energy expense to a queen, which explains why gynes frequently usurp other nests rather than founding one of their own. L. malachurum is a  Western Palaearctic  species and nests can be found across  Southern England  and the  Channel Islands , most of  continental Europe , and  North Africa .

Both features help pollen grains adhere to their bodies, but they also have specialized pollen-carrying structures; in most bees, this takes the form of a structure known as the  scopa , which is on the hind legs of most bees, and/or the lower abdomen (e.g., of  megachilid  bees), made up of thick, plumose  seta e.  Honey bee s,  bumblebee s, and their relatives do not have a scopa, but the hind leg is modified into a structure called the corbicula (also known as the " pollen basket "). Most bees gather  nectar , a concentrated energy source, and pollen, which is high  protein  food, to nurture their young, and inadvertently transfer some among the flowers as they are working.  Euglossine  bees pollinate orchids, but these are male bees collecting floral scents rather than females gathering nectar or pollen. Female orchid bees act as pollinators, but of flowers other than orchids.  Eusocial  bees such as honey bees need an abundant and steady  pollen source  to multiply.
83_1	CAR_73d17330061fec8f382fec8356d79192871883e9	Behaviourally, one of the most obvious characteristics of bees is that they collect pollen to provide provisions for their young, and have the necessary adaptations to do this. However, certain wasp species such as  pollen wasp s have similar behaviours, and a few species of bee  scavenge  from carcases to feed their offspring. The world's largest species of bee is thought to be the Indonesian resin bee  Megachile pluto , whose females can attain a length of . The smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in the tribe  Meliponini  whose workers are less than  in length.
83_1	CAR_77452802e5a66cb77dcc3a6892ef4f06ae9d0025	In Japan,  beekeeper s often prefer  European honey bee s because they are more productive than the endemic  Japanese honey bee s. However, it can be difficult to maintain a captive hive of European honey bees, as the giant hornets are devastating to the bee hives. Once a Japanese giant hornet has located a hive of European honey bees it leaves  pheromone  markers around it that quickly attract nest-mates to converge on the hive.  An individual hornet can kill forty European honey bees a minute while a group of 30 hornets can destroy an entire hive containing 30,000 bees in less than four hours. The hornets kill and dismember the bees, returning to their nest with the bee thoraxes, which they feed to their larvae, leaving heads and limbs behind. The honey and bee larvae are also taken to feed the hornet larvae.
83_1	CAR_851af56b990d7affffa2ee40fd605e074b5be593	Lasioglossum hemichalceum, otherwise known as L. erythrurum, is a  sweat bee  that is known to occupy certain regions of  Australia . Large numbers of unrelated female members will typically share a single nest. Unlike other bees, these nests are constructed underground by the independent efforts of the females. L. hemichalceum will typically begin creating new colonies during the summer, and will conduct brood production in late November through the first few months of spring.  The genetic relatedness of L. hemichalceum members varies depending on the members' relationships with one another.  Unlike other species of bees, the members of this species do not demonstrate aggressive behavior towards one another.  In addition, an interesting fact about L. hemichalceum is that as the size of the colony increases, the reproductive potential of each female does not change.  This is different from other species of bees.
83_1	CAR_acc261a08fca8b39467fc94227900b578b00b5b3	In the 1990s a student biologist, Olivia Messinger, did a census of bees at Pinnacles.  She found that the park has more bees per unit area than we know of, anywhere else on earth, around 400 species.  Most of these bees are solitary bees, not living in colonies like European honeybees, and most live for only three to four weeks.  And since flowers bloom here throughout the growing season, there are many niches for all the bee species.  An interesting five-minute video is found at sfnps.org/bees
83_1	CAR_d996ef0d2891c95b167f0b67e58a1ddb0e4991a7	The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms  pollinated  by insects such as  beetle s, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are  specialized  as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of  coevolution , flowers developed floral rewards such as  nectar  and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as  scopal hairs  and  pollen baskets  to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have  scopal hairs  located on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess  pollen baskets  on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the  adaptive radiation  of the  angiosperms , and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be  mutualistc .
83_1	CAR_e2bc324a701eae5a6e2384075c93989d6b298bbf	Interestingly, a bee does not experience diminishing returns because of nectar depletion or any other characteristic of the flowers themselves. In fact, the total amount of nectar foraged increases linearly with time spent in a patch. However, the weight of the nectar adds a significant cost to the bee's flight between flowers and its trip back to the hive. Wolf and Schmid-Hempel showed, by experimentally placing varying weights on the backs of bees, that the cost of heavy nectar is so great that it shortens the bees' lifespan. The shorter the lifespan of a worker bee, the less overall time it has to contribute to its colony. Thus, there is a curve of diminishing returns for the net yield of energy that the hive receives as the bee gathers more nectar during one trip.

83_1	CAR_fcb7df5ae96e10a3e83b193bb4af7a11dc68cc95	Since bees are characterized by a distinct color pattern as well as a defensive sting, they have been subject to mimicry in order to gain its known protective mark. Bumble bees are resembled by sawflies, other bees, day-flying moths, beetles, and flies. Cimbicid  sawflies  resemble bees, but have swollen antenna tips as a distinguisher. Other bees, such as carpenter and digger bees, contain a striking resemblance to bumble bees, but males contain a yellow clypeus and females have hindlegs with brushes rather than a pollen basket, which is a characteristic of bumble bees. Clearwing hawk moths (of the family  Sphingidae  such as the species  Hemaris thetis ) resemble bumble bees while foraging through flowers, but are distinct with skinny legs and spindle antennae. Bumble flower beetles ( Scarabaeidae  such as Euphoria inda) maintains a similar flight behavior to bumble bees like flying close to plants and buzzing loudly. The  longhorned beetle  also has a color scheme paralleling bumble bees. Flower flies are especially similar mimics of bumble bees, such as the robber fly, deer bot fly, and bee fly. Bumble bees have developed  Müllerian mimicry , when poisonous species mimic other dangerous species' warning signals, as a reinforced defense against predators.

After a foraging expedition, these  pollen basket s or corbiculae can be seen stuffed full of bright orange or yellow pollen. Stingless bees also collect nectar, which they store in an extension of their gut called a  crop . Back at the hive, the bees ripen or dehydrate the nectar droplets by spinning them inside their mouthparts until honey is formed. Ripening concentrates the nectar and increases the sugar content, though it is not nearly as concentrated as the honey from true honey bees; it is much thinner in consistency, and more prone to spoiling.

This topic is covered in the  Talmud  and is explained to be permissible on the grounds that the bee does not originally make the honey, the flower does, while the bees store and dehydrate the liquid into honey. This is different to  royal jelly , which is produced by bees directly and is considered non-Kosher.
83_2	CAR_3ee5a167ee73a25584ebb61874862189f9b7ebd3	The honey from stingless bees has a lighter color and a higher water content, from 25% to 35%, compared to the honey from the genus Apis. This contributes to its less cloying taste but also causes it to spoil more easily. Thus, for marketing, this honey needs to be processed through desiccation or pasteurization. In its natural state, it should be kept under refrigeration.

The food storage zone contains a honey storage pot and a  pollen  storage pot, but these are often intermixed. The honey of T. iridipennis is a rich source of antioxidant flavanoids. This is because workers collect  honey  from medicinally important herbal plants and flowers. The quantity of honey produced is a relatively small 600-700 grams per year. A study which compared the composition of T. iridipennis honey to those of other Indian bee species found the honey of T. iridipennis to have among the highest amounts of  flavonoids  and  flavonols  and displayed relatively high  Nitric Oxide  scavenging activity.

Honey is a biological mixture of inverted sugars, primarily glucose and fructose. It has antibacterial and anti fungal properties. Honey from the Western honey bee, along with the bee  Tetragonisca angustula , has specific antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria,  Staphylococcus aureus . Honey will not rot or ferment when stored under normal conditions, however it will crystallize over time. Although crystallized honey is acceptable for human use, bees can only use liquid honey and will remove and discard crystallized honey from the hive.
83_2	CAR_739b5c15c5854e83be79fc67846d17f986cb3a04	Pollen brought into the hive for feeding the brood is also stored. It must be packed firmly into comb cells and mixed with a small amount of honey so that it will not spoil. Unlike honey, which does not support bacterial life, stored pollen will become  rancid  without proper care. It has to be kept in honey cells.
83_2	CAR_85f67efc7ebb3ff6aeb00f917f0cdbe3609166d9	Bee pollen is the pollen ball that has been packed by worker  honeybee s into pellets. Bee bread is also the bee  pollen  with added  honey  and bee secretions and stored in  brood cell s, chambers of honeybees or of wood and mud created by female ground-nesting (such as the Leafcutting Bee)  bee s. With the Leafcutting Bee, when the pollen ball is complete, a single female lays an egg on top of the pollen ball, and seals the brood cell. Pollen balls are harvested as food for humans. Bee pollen is sometimes referred to as  ambrosia .Where as with Honeybees, the thing to keep in mind is that the forager bees that gather pollen do not eat it themselves, since when they transition to foraging, they stop producing the proteolytic enzymes necessary to digest it. So the foragers unload the pollen they’ve gathered directly into open cells located at the interface between the brood and stored honey, creating a typical band of what is called beebread - the substance which is the main food source for honey bee larvae and workers.
83_2	CAR_932595ed3e70fad784cb9f507551596d449c34b1	Worker bees combine pollen, honey and glandular secretions and allow it to ferment in the comb to make bee bread. The fermentation process releases additional nutrients from the pollen and can produce antibiotics and fatty acids which inhibit spoilage. Bee bread is eaten by  nurse bees  (younger workers) who then produce the protein-rich royal jelly needed by the queen and developing larvae in their hypopharyngeal glands.

It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most  microorganism s do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant  endospore s of the bacterium  Clostridium botulinum , which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in  botulism .
83_2	CAR_e33e5a6bd8f49cf7e569457fec752c79be3bc393	Honey is produced by bees from  nectar  collection which serves the dual purpose to support  metabolism  of muscle activity during  foraging  and for long-term food storage as honey. During foraging, bees access part of the nectar collected to support metabolic activity of flight muscles, with the majority of collected nectar destined for  regurgitation , digestion, and storage as honey. In cold weather or when other food sources are scarce, adult and  larva l bees use stored honey as food.
83_2	CAR_e5d7e34db4b630393a14f07a38a434e40f6fe96a	Leaving the hive, foraging bees collect sugar-rich flower nectar and return to the hive where they use their "honey stomachs" to ingest and regurgitate the nectar repeatedly until it is partially digested. Bee  digestive enzymes  -  invertase ,  amylase , and  diastase  - and  gastric acid  hydrolyze sucrose to a mixture of glucose and fructose. The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion for as long as 20 minutes until the product reaches storage quality. It is then placed in  honeycomb  cells left unsealed while still high in water content (about 20%) and natural yeasts, which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the newly formed honey to ferment. The process continues as hive bees flutter their wings constantly to circulate air and  evaporate  water from the honey to a content around 18%, raising the sugar concentration, and preventing  fermentation . The bees then cap the cells with wax to seal them. As removed from the hive by a  beekeeper , honey has a long shelf life and will not ferment if properly sealed.
83_2	CAR_f3929f90abbfb69766244762f09da24e8d3917f6	Meliponiculture is the practice of stingless bee keeping. This is where bee keepers maintain, reproduce, and utilize stingless bee colonies for their own profit. These colonies tend to be managed through artificial hives so that the bee keepers have the ability to propagate the colonies and produce hive products such as honey and pollen. These products are then sold to various buyers from health food stores to gift shops. The honey of T. carbonaria possess a peculiar smell which makes it quite the appealing product.  When the first set of work began in 1984 on this stingless bee, the human industry was practically non-existent. Since then, the interest in stingless bees, more specifically T. carbonaria has greatly increased. This has allowed for the establishment of conservation groups along the eastern regions of Australia. T. carbonaria is the most popular species that bee keepers tend to, followed by the A. australis and then T. hockingsi. The main reason for most people to keep T. carbonaria is for enjoyment and conservation. With this, the amount of honey produced is constantly increasing at a fast pace. T. carbonaria is the main species that bee keepers produce honey with, out of the stingless bees in Australia. Bee keepers report that one of the major limiting factors in propagating colonies is the availability of queens. More research is needed on queen rearing to fix this limiting factor.

A ratio of 1 part sugar to 4 parts water is a common recipe, although hummingbirds will defend feeders more aggressively when sugar content is at 35%, indicating preference for nectar with higher  sweetness  and sugar content.   Brown, turbinado, and "raw" sugars contain  iron , which can be deadly to hummingbirds if consumed over long periods.  Honey  is made by  bees  from the nectar of flowers, but it is not good to use in feeders because when it is diluted with water,  microorganisms  easily grow in it, causing it to spoil rapidly.
83_2	MARCO_1279411	More has been written about honeybees than any other species of insect. The human fascination with this insect began thousands of years ago when people discovered what wonderfully tasty stuff honey is! Honey is a thick liquid produced by certain types of bees from the nectar of flowers. While many species of insects consume nectar, honeybees refine and concentrate nectar to make honey. Indeed, they make lots of honey so they will have plenty of food for times when flower nectar is unavailable, such as winter.

83_2	MARCO_1457727	We often get calls when people discover their honey has darkened or crystallized. Improper storage of honey can cause this problem. Honey should be stored in a cool, dry area inside a tightly covered container. Over time the honey will darken and flavor will change but it will be safe to eat indefinitely. As it darkens, it may lose some flavor or become cloudy. As the honey becomes cloudy, you may even notice crystals in it. This will not make the honey unsafe as long as it has been stored properly. Honey stored in the refrigerator will crystallize more quickly. If your honey has crystallized, you can place the container in warm water and stir the honey until the crystals dissolve. Resist the urge to use boiling hot water to melt crystals as this can damage the color and flavor of the honey. If your honey foams or smells like alcohol, discard it as it has spoiled.
83_2	MARCO_1954594	The nectar collected is what the worker bee uses to make honey. So the bee arrives at a flower, and proceeds to drink as much nectar as she can hold. She then passes the nectar to another worker bee (the nectar is held on her tongue) so the water in it can evaporate. This way it is highly concentrated, and never spoils. Seriously, the honey bee is brilliant!

83_2	MARCO_6587871	It is, of course, true that honey is a wonderful foodâfor bees! The popularly fostered idea among health seekers that honey is a wholesome, nutritious and natural sweet for humans is fallacious. Honey is the product of the beeâs stomach.The bee ingests pollen from flowers and, in its stomach, mixes it with formic, manite and other acids. Then the honey is deposited in cone cells and, by the wind created by a multitude of bees wings, substantially dehydrated.s a food for us honey is woefully mineral and vitamin deficient. Humans require infinitely more food factors than bees. While honey contains several very desirable sugars, these have been rendered toxic by the protective acids imparted to them by the bees. These acids are the beesâ preservatives.

83_2	MARCO_6987554	It is very unlikely the honey was bad. Properly stored, honey can last many years without even any degradation of flavor, let alone spoiling. In the extreme, honey can last centuries, though the flavor and color will be affected the longer it is stored. That being said, it is possible for honey to go âbadâ if improperly stored, though that depends somewhat on what you mean by âbadâ.
83_2	MARCO_6987560	Very few bacteria or microorganisms can survive in an environment like that, they just die. Theyâre smothered by it, essentially.â What Harris points out represents an important feature of honeyâs longevity: for honey to spoil, there needs to be something inside of it that can spoil. With such an inhospitable environment, organisms canât survive long enough within the jar of honey to have the chance to spoil. Honey is also naturally extremely acidic. âIt has a pH that falls between 3 and 4.5, approximately, and that acid will kill off almost anything that wants to grow there,â Harris explains.
83_2	MARCO_7223270	Honey also has trace elements in it -- stuff that bees picked up while going from plant to plant. These will depend on region, so depending on the source of your honey it could have varying small amounts of minerals like zinc and selenium, as well as some vitamins. And because honey doesn't break down in nature, it doesn't contain preservatives or other additives.
83_2	MARCO_7679417	The water content of honey is a key factor in why it doesnât spoil. At 17%, its water content is much lower than that of bacteria or fungi. Honey also has a low water activity; this is a measure of the amount of water in a substance that is available to support microbial growth.
83_3	CAR_07626cc57e5dfa5d8662dea7b6e49df6d8cbdace	American foulbrood (AFB), caused by the spore-forming  Paenibacillus larvae    (formerly classified as Bacillus larvae and Paenibacillus larvae ssp larvae/pulvifaciens), is the most widespread and destructive of the bee brood diseases. P. larvae is a rod-shaped bacterium.  Larvae up to three days old become infected by ingesting spores present in their food. Young larvae less than 24 hours old are most susceptible to infection.  Spores germinate in the gut of the larva and the vegetative bacteria begin to grow, taking nourishment from the larva. Spores will not germinate in larvae over three days old. Infected larvae normally die after their cell is sealed. The vegetative form of the bacterium will die, but not before it produces many millions of spores. American foulbrood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and can remain viable for more than 40 years in honey and beekeeping equipment. Each dead larva may contain as many as 100 million spores.  This disease only affects the bee larvae, but is highly infectious and deadly to bee brood. Infected larvae darken and die.
83_3	CAR_0b9fcd7633550b31f761039ef7197e5520022a43	The outlook for meliponines in Mesoamerica is uncertain. The number of active Melipona beekeepers is rapidly declining in favor of the more economical, nonindigenous Africanized  Apis mellifera . The high honey yield, 100 kg or more annually, along with the ease of hive care and ability to create new hives from existing stock, commonly outweighs the negative consequences of "killer bee" hive maintenance. Furthermore,  Africanized honey bee s do not visit some flora, such as those in the  tomato family , and several forest trees and shrubs, which rely on the native stingless bees for pollination. A decline in populations of native flora has already occurred in areas where stingless bees have been displaced by Africanized honey bees. An additional blow to the art of meliponine beekeeping is that many of the meliponine beekeepers are now elderly, and their hives may not be cared for once they die. The hives are considered similar to an old family collection, to be parted out once the collector dies or to be buried in whole or part along with the beekeeper upon death. In fact, a survey of a once-popular area of the Mayan lowlands shows the rapid decline of beekeepers, down to around 70 in 2004 from thousands in the late 1980s. It is traditional in the Mayan lowlands that the hive itself or parts of the hive be buried along with the beekeeper to volar al cielo, "to fly to heaven". Conservation efforts are underway in several parts of Mesoamerica.
83_3	CAR_137dad62d40881e65365fca755681b5bcb8af5d0	A single African bee sting is no more  venomous  than a single European bee sting, though African honeybees respond more quickly when disturbed than do European honey bees. They send out three to four times as many workers in response to a threat. They will also pursue an intruder for a greater distance from the hive. Although people have died as a result of 100-300 stings, it has been estimated that the average lethal dose for an adult is 500-1100 bee stings. In terms of industrial honey production, the African bee produces far less honey than its European counterpart, whilst producing more swarms and absconding (abandoning its nest). For this reason, African races of Honeybees are less desirable than European races, except where the proclivity of African bees give beekeepers no other option due to the Africans' tendency to invade and take over European nests.

If the queen is infected, her ovaries degenerate and egg production drops due to atrophy of the oocytes, after which she is likely to be superseded. The disease pattern described by Higes et al.. in Spain for N. ceranae is slightly different from that of N. apis. The changes in the digestive system were substantially more serious than with N. apis, related to particularly heavy and spacious cell lesions. Conversely, classical symptoms were missing from N. ceranae, such as diarrhea, crawling, large numbers of dead bees in the apiary, etc. Bees tend to die away from the apiary, which causes a reduction in food gathered and can eventually lead to colony collapse. Ritter (CVUA Freiburg) reported symptoms can arise throughout the year from N. ceranae, in contrast to N. apis. In the winter, some colonies died within a short time and the bees lay dead in the box (in Spain, hives usually remained empty). Whether these features are related to the new form of Nosema cannot be conclusively proven.
83_3	CAR_2c673ee4b797955d201a8e9b8b5d350fcfd7f8df	According to the  European Food Safety Authority  (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the  British Beekeepers Association  reported the bee population in the United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no harmonisation was used in the way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.
83_3	CAR_32593600ac45a6d370ec87061ddadc3914d759e9	These parasites may be at least partially responsible for declining wild bee populations. They cause the bees to lose their ability to distinguish between flowers that contain  nectar  and those that don't. They make many mistakes by visiting nectar scarce flowers and in so doing, slowly starve to death. Commercially bred bees are used in greenhouses to pollinate plants, for example tomatoes, and these bees typically harbor the parasite, while wild bees do not. It is believed that the commercial bees transmitted the parasite to wild populations in some cases. They escape from the greenhouses through vents; a simple mesh could help prevent this .
83_3	CAR_3d9b873a80654ed0a3e4b7394354ec88bc5486a4	When healthy bees are fed pollen filled with fungicides, insecticides and other agriculture chemicals, they are more likely to be infected by  Nosema ceranae , a parasitic microsporidian fungus associated with widespread death of honey bees.  Hives of western honey bees infected with Nosema ceranae are wiped out within eight days indicating that CCD may be caused by N. ceranae. A research team claim to have ruled out many other potential causes, however, a 2009 survey of US CCD-affected bee populations found only about half of the colonies sampled, both in CCD and control populations, were infected with N. ceranae.
83_3	CAR_45f928a503178d2de64d9ee8b04e1de3f48788d1	In 2007, one of the patterns reported by the CCD Study Group at Pennsylvania State was that all producers in a preliminary survey noted a period of "extraordinary stress" affecting the colonies in question prior to their die-off, most commonly involving poor nutrition and/or drought. This was the only factor that all of the cases of CCD had in common in the report; accordingly, there appeared to be at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon was correlated to nutritional stress that may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This was similar to the findings of another independent survey done in 2007 in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not.

83_3	CAR_4f6a5fe0cc6ddfef0a740b53cc2226df79b1afba	In areas of suitable temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This is the reason why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as  Varroa destructor , some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, it is possible that the Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.

The Atlantic Rainforest has very high levels of biodiversity but human fragmentation of the forest is leading to huge loss. Due to the interconnectedness of the environment the loss of one plant or insect could cause many others to go extinct. As seen above, T. angustula bees are quite important for pollinating many plants and providing good quality honey. Steps are taken to understand the diet of these bees and their nest sites in order to keep them from dying out in an area. Conservation of the forest is a priority of many scientists and preservationists, and the survival of stingless bees plays a factor in the importance of keeping these forests.

After trying to keep the bees in the Simpson home, Lisa and Marge find an abandoned greenhouse for the bees to live in. However, the site of the greenhouse is exactly where Mr. Burns plans to construct his new arena.

In early 2007, abnormally high die-offs (30–70% of hives) of European honey bee colonies occurred in North America; such a decline seems unprecedented in recent history. This has been dubbed "colony collapse disorder" (CCD); it is unclear whether this is simply an accelerated phase of the general decline due to  stochastic ally more adverse conditions in 2006, or a novel phenomenon. CCD is unique due to the lack of evidence as to what causes the sudden die-off of adult worker bees, as well as few to no dead bees found around the hive.
83_3	CAR_94181c44870a0d1c71ec328736ce99874e45cc58	Chinese researchers found Nosema ceranae in spring 2005 in  Taiwan  for the first time, and it has now been seen on western honey bees.  The new pathogen was discovered in 2005 in  Spain  and was observed to have a notably higher virulence than the western version. The disease caused by N. ceranae in western honey bees in Spain is related to heavier disease patterns deviating from the previously typical findings (unusually heavy intestine injuries in the bees, no  diarrhea , preferential affliction of older collecting bees). Bees die far away from the dwellings, as when they leave they are too weak to return. This leads to collapse of the bee colony. Within a few years, a strongly increased propagation of Nosema was observed, and its occurrence was happening all year round due to the higher resistance of N. ceranae. A higher reinfection rate of the bee colonies is assumed, since the pathogen survives longer in the external environment.
83_3	CAR_9fb068b4dba23d50b8cc6cad6d04eadc446fa58d	According to a 2007 article, the  mite   Varroa destructor  remains the world's most destructive honey bee killer, due in part to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and  acute bee paralysis virus , which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the  immune system  of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the  University of Guelph  in Canada, studied 413  Ontario  bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses which led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.
83_3	CAR_a9e7550595fcc6011ae2d89b42047afec088ec6a	The most significant difference between the two types is how quickly N. ceranae can cause a colony to die. Bees can die within 8 days after exposure to N. ceranae, a finding not yet confirmed by other researchers. The forager caste seems the most affected, leaving the colony presumably to forage, but never returning. This results in a reduced colony consisting mostly  of nurse bees with their queen, a state very similar to that seen in CCD. Little advice on treatment is available, but it has been suggested that the most effective control of N. ceranae is the antibiotic  fumagillin  as recommended for N. apis.The  genome  of N. ceranae was sequenced in 2009. This should help scientists trace its  migration  patterns, establish how it became dominant, and help measure the spread of infection by enabling diagnostic tests and treatments to be developed.

83_3	CAR_cb1805e63aaab5a903b052a775bd5632b4ef0c68	One possible cause is the infestation of parasites,   namely Varroa mites ( Varroa destructor ). These mites attach to the bee and drain the bee of its lymph-like body fluid, dehydrating the bee which results in a suppressed immune system and an increased risk to disease.  In addition, the mites leave an open wound on the bee, allowing viruses such as deformed wing virus, acute bee paralysis virus, and many other potentially lethal diseases to easy infect and dominate the bee due to its already weak immune system.

83_3	CAR_e1beb322733e156d4f382d77dacf0ed1ea578912	Pesticides used on bee forage are far more likely to enter the colony by the pollen stores rather than  nectar (because pollen is carried externally on the bees, while nectar is carried internally, and may kill the bee if too toxic), though not all potentially lethal chemicals, either natural or man-made, affect the adult bees; many primarily affect the brood, but brood die-off does not appear to be happening in CCD. Most significantly, brood are not fed honey, and adult bees consume relatively little pollen; accordingly, the pattern in CCD suggests, if contaminants or toxins from the environment 'are' responsible, it is most likely to be via the honey, as the adults are dying (or leaving), not the brood (though possibly effects of contaminated pollen consumed by juveniles may only show after they have developed into adults).

This, however, does not solve all problems associated with spraying and the label instructions should be followed regardless of doing this. Sealing honey bees from flight on hot days can kill bees. Beekeeper notification does not offer any protection to bees, if the beekeeper cannot access them, or to wild native or feral honey bees. Thus, beekeeper notification as the sole protection procedure does not really protect all the pollinators of the area, and is, in effect, a circumventing of the label requirements. Pesticide losses are a major factor in  pollinator decline .

83_4	CAR_23c3b79994286a1b89dbc6cf83c1c4687a024955	Bumble bees are generally host to a diversity of  parasitoids  in which the larvae grows inside the living host. The majority of parasitoids for bumble bees are flies and about 30 percent or more bees within the area can be infected. The process of parasitism consists of the fly attaching to the bee in flight and inserting her oviposits between the terga of the bee. The larval fly hatches within the bee host and develops by feeding on the host’s tissues. The bee lives for about two weeks before dying. The fly then pupates and spends the winter inside the bee, fully developed, before it emerges the following year. North American bumblebees are also hosted by one parasitoid wasp and the moth, B. variabilis.  Hibernating queen bumble bees are parasitized by a nematode worm,  Sphaerularia bombi . This parasite does not reduce life span, but instead causes the sterilization of the queen. It has been observed that affected queens forage two to three weeks later than those that are unaffected.  Parasitic microorganisms also use bees as their host. Parasitic microorganisms’ effects may be lethal or sublethal. Pathogens may be transmitted within a colony or the bee may be infected at flowers. Tracheal mites ( Locustacarus buchneri ) leads to reduced foraging efficiency by living in the bee’s alveoli. Certain protozoans and fungi consume the host tissue or gut substances of the bumble bee’s digestive tract, decreasing foraging efficiency, life span, and thus the colony fitness. Bees may contain symbiotic bacteria that offer some immunity to pathogens. Further exposure to habitat loss as well as pesticide exposure may lead to bee predisposition, thus promoting the species’ decay.

83_4	CAR_32593600ac45a6d370ec87061ddadc3914d759e9	These parasites may be at least partially responsible for declining wild bee populations. They cause the bees to lose their ability to distinguish between flowers that contain  nectar  and those that don't. They make many mistakes by visiting nectar scarce flowers and in so doing, slowly starve to death. Commercially bred bees are used in greenhouses to pollinate plants, for example tomatoes, and these bees typically harbor the parasite, while wild bees do not. It is believed that the commercial bees transmitted the parasite to wild populations in some cases. They escape from the greenhouses through vents; a simple mesh could help prevent this .

Good management requires keeping the hive free of  pests  and  disease , and ensuring that the bee colony has room in the  hive  to expand. Chemical treatments, if used for parasite control, must be done in the off-season to avoid any honey contamination. Exterminators therefore often offer bee-safe and honey-safe treatment methods targeted towards beekeepers.

This was the only factor that all of the cases of CCD had in common in the report; accordingly, there appeared to be at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon was correlated to nutritional stress that may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This was similar to the findings of another independent survey done in 2007 in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not.

Some beekeepers place wet frames outside so that it will be reclaimed by the bees. This must be done early in the morning or late in the evening as the bees will aggressively harvest such a rich source.

When a bee comes in contact with pesticides while foraging, the bee may die immediately without returning to the hive. In this case, the  queen bee , brood, and nurse bees are not contaminated and the colony survives. Alternatively, the bee may come into contact with an insecticide and transport it back to the colony in contaminated pollen or nectar or on its body, potentially causing widespread colony death.
83_4	CAR_e1beb322733e156d4f382d77dacf0ed1ea578912	Pesticides used on bee forage are far more likely to enter the colony by the pollen stores rather than  nectar (because pollen is carried externally on the bees, while nectar is carried internally, and may kill the bee if too toxic), though not all potentially lethal chemicals, either natural or man-made, affect the adult bees; many primarily affect the brood, but brood die-off does not appear to be happening in CCD. Most significantly, brood are not fed honey, and adult bees consume relatively little pollen; accordingly, the pattern in CCD suggests, if contaminants or toxins from the environment 'are' responsible, it is most likely to be via the honey, as the adults are dying (or leaving), not the brood (though possibly effects of contaminated pollen consumed by juveniles may only show after they have developed into adults).

Much of this has to do with the effect of  agrichemicals , like  insecticides ,  herbicides  and large quantities of synthetic  fertilizers , on what are considered beneficials. Citing the reduction or elimination of various organisms as a side effect of agrichemical-based farming, some argue that critical damage is being done to the  ecosystem , to the point where conventional agriculture is  unsustainable . For example, if bee populations are reduced by insecticides aimed at other pests, pollination is inhibited and crops don't appear. If soil microorganisms are killed off, natural soil regeneration is inhibited, and reliance on mechanical and chemical inputs to keep the soil viable is increased. The longer term impact of these conditions has not been determined. Commercial ventures currently exist to provide pollinators and  biological pest control .

Some possible explanations could include  habitat fragmentation ,  climate change ,  disease ,  agrochemical s, and other factors. As stated previously, B. ruderatus has seen a population decline in Britain and has disappeared completely from many of its previous sites. Declines in bee populations can lead to other ecological issues, such as declines in the success of plant species that rely on their pollination.
83_5	CAR_0bae4b6568c48f3334c3eb5721680c2b6d9f286d	The largest threat facing B. frigidus is climate change, as these bees inhabit a specialized climate. As temperature rises, the bees may be driven either farther north or to extinction. With increasing temperatures, snow does not pack as tightly. This leads to earlier melting, and during the summer, water isn’t as readily available. This causes the habitat to dry out and fewer plants bloom, thus reducing nectar supply for the bees.

A specific study in  Illinois  shows that there was a severe decline in the middle of the 20th century from 1940-1960. In the state of Illinois specifically, intensive  farming  and urban development have taken away the natural landscapes and habitats that these bees would normally occupy. This decline in B. terricola corresponded with the huge growth in  agriculture  and urban development. Furthermore, the Nosema bombi parasite may also contribute to the decline in populations of B. terricola as they particularly attack these bees.

Honey bees that are genetically inclined towards resources high in sucrose like concentrated nectar will not be able to sustain themselves in harsher environments. The noted PER to low sucrose concentration in Africanized honey bees may be a result of selective pressure in times of scarcity when their survival depends on their attraction to low quality resources.

There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or  limed , or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to  oil palm  plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.
83_5	CAR_155e5150a036f1d2b8755557a0d6c986d37fb269	As stingless bees are harmless to humans, they have become an increasingly attractive addition to the suburban backyard. Most meliponine beekeepers do not keep the bees for  honey , but rather for the pleasure of conserving a native species whose original  habitat  is declining due to human development. In return, the bees  pollinate  crops, garden flowers, and bushland during their search for nectar and pollen.  While a number of beekeepers fill a small niche market for bush honey, native meliponines only produce small amounts and the structure of their hives makes the honey difficult to extract. Only in warm areas of Australia such as  Queensland  and northern  New South Wales  can the bees produce more honey than they need for their own survival. Harvesting honey from a nest in a cooler area could weaken or even kill the nest.

Britain adopted the  Environmental Stewardship  scheme with the goal of enhancing the supply of pollen and nectar sources for bumblebees.

In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee,  Bombus subterraneus , which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with  Natural England , Hymettus and the  RSPB , has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from  Skåne  in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at  Dungeness  in Kent. The queens were checked for  mites  and  American foulbrood  disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of  Romney Marsh  have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five "Schedule 41 priority" species: the ruderal bumblebee,  Bombus ruderatus ;  the red-shanked carder bee,  Bombus ruderarius ; the shrill carder bee,  Bombus sylvarum ; the brown-banded carder bee,  Bombus humilis  and the moss carder bee,   Bombus muscorum .

Aside from pathogen spillover, however, novel pesticides also impact populations of B. affinis.   Neonicotinoid s in particular are pesticides that are toxic to bees, however, they are commonly used for pest control on crops and turf.  Because B. affinis nests are built underground, they are uniquely susceptible to this pesticide's use on turf.  Lastly, increases in urbanization and industrialization have meant the loss of native habitats.  While other species such as  B. bimaculatus , the two-spotted bumble bee, have adapted well to urban environments, B. affinis has not.  It is not known, however, whether or not the reduction of native food plants in particular has impacted B. affinis.

This suggests that there is a large amount of allodapine diversity that is not covered by formal scientific taxonomy. Conservation concerns centre on two regions: (i) large-scale habitat loss in Madagascar poses a major threat to that island’s unique bee fauna, including allodapine bees, many of which are still to be scientifically described; and (ii) the Australian region is likely to contain many undescribed socially parasitic species  which are threatened because of their very small populations sizes. Conservation threats to allodapine bees in Asia have not been studied.

In particular, the register, funded by the  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  and administered by the  National Bee Unit , will be used to monitor health trends and help establish whether the honey industry is under threat from supposed colony collapse disorder. Britain's 20,000 beekeepers have been invited to participate. In October 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers’ Association stated, "We still do not believe CCD is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however we are continuing to experience colony losses, many if not most of which can be explained. The approach being taken in UK beekeeping is to raise the profile of integrated bee health management, in other words identifying and trying to eliminate factors which reduce the health status of a colony. This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions."

Many of the permanent flower-rich areas where the bee commonly forages have been destroyed by increased commercial farming. B. muscorum has poor dispersal ability compared to other species of bumblebee, making it more vulnerable to habitat loss. As a result, populations have decreased dramatically in recent decades.

The trend to  monoculture  means that greater concentrations of pollinators are needed at bloom time than ever before, yet the area is  forage  poor or even deadly to bees for the rest of the season. The other trend is the  decline of pollinator populations , due to  pesticide  misuse and overuse, new diseases and  parasite s of bees,  clearcut logging , decline of beekeeping,  suburb an development, removal of  hedge s and other  habitat  from  farm s, and public concern about bees. Widespread  aerial spraying  for  mosquito es due to  West Nile  fears is causing an acceleration of the loss of pollinators.

Since many tropical plant taxa, especially flowering orchid plants, strongly rely on euglossine bee pollinators for  cross-fertilization , declining euglossine bee populations could lead to widespread pollen limitation and low reproductive rates. This decline is most likely attributable to human activity such as habitat disturbance—habitat degradation, pervasive pesticide use, pathogen spillover, forest fragmentation, and climatic alteration.

In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil will be in the more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.

The global dependency on livestock and agriculture has rendered no less than 50% of the earths landmass uninhabitable for bees. The agricultural practice of planting one crop (monoculture) in a given area year after year leads to extreme malnourishment. Regardless if the planted crop does flower and provide food for the bee, the bee will still be malnourished because a single plant cannot meet the nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the crops needed to support livestock (primarily cattle) tend to be grains which do not provide nectar.

In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee,  Bombus subterraneus , which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with  Natural England , Hymettus and the  RSPB , has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from  Skåne  in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at  Dungeness  in Kent. The queens were checked for  mites  and  American foulbrood  disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of  Romney Marsh  have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established.

Through his interpretations of bees, he studied the behavior and the equipment used to house them.After discovering many unanswered questions with the current equipment, Langstroth knew he could provide a solution. Langstroth originally was trying to improve the  Bevan bar hive  because he found that the combs could not be removed and this gave him a huge advantage to create a better hive. Langstroth discovered that the bees kept filling holes necessary to take the hive out with propolis, bee glue, so he came up with a new solution.On his journey to create the perfect frame, Lorenzo found it helpful to write a manual of his findings. His book, Langstroth on the Hive and the Honeybee: A Beekeeper’s Manual, became a fundamental teaching mechanism for students of beekeeping. His book is considered a basic text on the skill of beekeeping because it is more of a “how to” explanation of beekeeping. The book states information related to bees, honey, and beekeeping. Langstroth sees beekeeping “in the present state of public opinion, it requires no little courage to venture upon the introduction of a new hive and system of management; but I feel confident that a new era in bee-keeping has arrived.” Langstroth viewed bees as holy creatures: "Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in 'bees,' and 'God' in every thing".With Langstroth’s love of bees inevitably came his invention of the  moveable bee-frame . The moveable beehives solved the problem by providing a space between the frames and the hive walls, bottom, and top cover. The moveable-frame beehive was patented in 1852, No 9300.This invention of the beehive marks the new era of the beehive. Three advantages Langstroth states of the moveable frame are: 1. “The scientific beekeeper could examine every comb quickly and easily. The Langstroth hive would be cheap, and the combs could be removed with safety to the bees.” 2. “The practical beekeeper, who wished an income from his bees, could propagate queens, make artificial swarms, supply destitute hives with honey or brood, and produce honey ready for the market in boxes or in glass tumblers, and he could protect his hives against the bee moth. In short, he could do almost anything he wanted to do with his bees.” 3. “The farmer could easily procure honey for his own use”.

Imidacloprid was first widely used in the United States in 1996 as it replaced 3 broad classes of insecticides.  In 2006, U.S. commercial migratory beekeepers reported sharp declines in their  honey bee  colonies. This has happened in the past; however, unlike previous losses, adult bees were abandoning their hives.  Scientists named this phenomenon  colony collapse disorder  (CCD). Reports show that beekeepers in most states have been affected by CCD. Although no single factor has been identified as causing CCD, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in their progress report on CCD, stated that CCD may be "a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically."
83_7	CAR_20a4b7b6297c6167f90b6b3a44fc6958291f1e99	Other researchers state that colony collapse disorder is mainly a problem of feeding the bees a  monoculture  diet when they should receive food from a variety of sources/plants. In winter, these bees are given a single food source such as  corn syrup  (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples). The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. Honey bees are only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for honey bees to be introduced to exclusively, including  sweet clover  and  mustard .

The species is found throughout  Eurasia  in fragmented populations, but is most commonly found in the  British Isles . B. muscorum is a  eusocial  insect. The queen is monandrous, mating with only one male after leaving a mature nest to found its own. Males mate territorially and the species is susceptible to inbreeding and bottlenecks. The species builds its nests on or just under the ground in open grassland and forages very close to the nest. In recent years, populations have significantly declined due to loss of natural habitat. B. muscorum is currently listed as  vulnerable  in Europe by the European Red List of Bees.
83_7	CAR_2b00c2ca451f0e5661620148b13e6a7466630e43	Insecticides can kill bees  and may be a cause of  pollinator decline , the loss of bees that  pollinate  plants, and  colony collapse disorder  (CCD), in which worker bees from a  beehive  or  Western honey bee  colony abruptly disappear. Loss of pollinators means a reduction in  crop yield s. Sublethal doses of insecticides (i.e. imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids) affect bee foraging behavior. However, research into the causes of CCD was inconclusive as of June 2007.
83_7	CAR_2edc6f52d19edc9ec11ec51caf363f6e87299dc0	A review of 919 peer-reviewed scientific studies investigating the effects of EMF on wildlife, humans and plants included seven studies involving honey bees; six of these reported negative effects from exposure to EMF radiation, but none specifically demonstrated any link to CCD. The review noted that according to one study, when active mobile phones were kept inside beehives, worker bees stopped coming to the hives after 10 days. The same study also found drastic decrease in the egg production of queen bees in these colonies and stated "electromagnetic radiation exposure provides a better explanation for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) than other theories".  The review authors concluded: "existing literature shows that the EMRs are interfering with the biological systems in more ways than one" and recommended recognising EMF as a pollutant. However, they also noted that "these studies are not representative of the real life situations or natural levels of EMF exposure. More studies need to be taken up to scientifically establish the link, if any, between the observed abnormalities and disorders in bee hives such as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)".
83_7	CAR_3101a38e77ec2a30b6cb836cbdccf1123b54b365	In 2012, a parasitic fly ( Apocephalus borealis ) larva, known to prey on bumble bees and wasps, was found in a test tube containing a dead honey bee believed to have been affected by CCD,   possibly indicating the  phorid  fly may be one cause of CCD. The mature fly lays eggs in the bee's abdomen, which feed on the bee after hatching. Infected bees behave abnormally, foraging at night and gathering around lights like moths. Eventually the bee leaves the colony to die. The phorid fly larvae then emerge from the neck of the bee.
83_7	CAR_34d35ea59b6fdd5bdefece429f6411eba3799921	Several possible causes for CCD have been proposed, but no single proposal has gained widespread acceptance among the scientific community. Suggested causes include: infections with  Varroa  and  Acarapis   mite s;  malnutrition ; various  pathogen s;  genetic factors ;  immunodeficiencies ;  loss of habitat ; changing  beekeeping  practices; or a combination of factors.  A large amount of speculation has surrounded a family of pesticides called  neonicotinoid s as having caused CCD.
83_7	CAR_364b74eb118defab8b525316973e940f38609809	Experts believe that imidacloprid is one of many possible causes of bee decline and the recent bee malady termed  colony collapse disorder  (CCD). In 2011, according to the  United States Department of Agriculture , no single factor alone is responsible for the malady, however  honey bees  are thought to possibly be affected by neonicotinoid chemicals existing as residues in the nectar and pollen which bees forage on.  The scientists studying CCD have tested samples of pollen and have indicated findings of a broad range of substances, including insecticides,  fungicides , and  herbicides .  They note that while the doses taken up by bees are not lethal, they are concerned about possible chronic problems caused by long-term exposure.
83_7	CAR_3d9b873a80654ed0a3e4b7394354ec88bc5486a4	When healthy bees are fed pollen filled with fungicides, insecticides and other agriculture chemicals, they are more likely to be infected by  Nosema ceranae , a parasitic microsporidian fungus associated with widespread death of honey bees.  Hives of western honey bees infected with Nosema ceranae are wiped out within eight days indicating that CCD may be caused by N. ceranae. A research team claim to have ruled out many other potential causes, however, a 2009 survey of US CCD-affected bee populations found only about half of the colonies sampled, both in CCD and control populations, were infected with N. ceranae.
83_7	CAR_420a9a3c5ab869fce637a32dbbb9ec26124e8d0a	In 2008 high levels of the pesticides  fluvalinate  and  coumaphos  were found in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals have been used to try to eradicate  varroa mite s, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. A 2009 study confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between the pesticide and reduced bee longevity. Nosema ceranae, was found in high concentrations in the majority of the bees tested, even after administering large doses of the antibiotic  fumagillin . Maryann Frazier commented, "Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD. We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses and pesticides."
83_7	CAR_437540ebf5760e7a9ee3779423d738f1c8c570d1	As of 2007, a new phenomenon called  colony collapse disorder  (CCD) began affecting  bee  hives all over North America. Initial speculation on possible causes included new parasites, pesticide use, and the use of Bt transgenic crops. The  Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium  found no evidence that pollen from Bt crops is adversely affecting bees.  According to the USDA, "Genetically modified (GM) crops, most commonly Bt corn, have been offered up as the cause of CCD. But there is no correlation between where GM crops are planted and the pattern of CCD incidents. Also, GM crops have been widely planted since the late 1990s, but CCD did not appear until 2006. In addition, CCD has been reported in countries that do not allow GM crops to be planted, such as Switzerland. German researchers have noted in one study a possible correlation between exposure to Bt pollen and compromised immunity to Nosema."   The actual cause of CCD was unknown in 2007, and scientists believe it may have multiple exacerbating causes.
83_7	CAR_45f928a503178d2de64d9ee8b04e1de3f48788d1	In 2007, one of the patterns reported by the CCD Study Group at Pennsylvania State was that all producers in a preliminary survey noted a period of "extraordinary stress" affecting the colonies in question prior to their die-off, most commonly involving poor nutrition and/or drought. This was the only factor that all of the cases of CCD had in common in the report; accordingly, there appeared to be at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon was correlated to nutritional stress that may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This was similar to the findings of another independent survey done in 2007 in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not.
83_7	CAR_56e3314e3c073aafbb365b711a7617807a799cf2	Honey bee s pollinate crops responsible for about a third of the human diet; about $224 billion worth of crops worldwide. Beginning in 2006, beekeepers in the United States began to report unexplained losses of hives — 30 percent and upward — leading to a phenomenon called  colony collapse disorder  (CCD). The cause of CCD remains under debate, but scientific consensus is beginning to emerge suggesting that there is no one cause but rather a combination of factors including lack of foraging plants, infections, breeding, and pesticides—with none catastrophic on their own, but having a synergistic effect when occurring in combination.
83_7	CAR_5702b87a506d86ff8af8a986826b3faba7e59eaa	In 2012, researchers announced findings that sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly more susceptible to infection by the fungus Nosema, thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD.
83_7	CAR_5705e2aa78ecb1d9d76b693515946349e20b3c7e	The WSU work also focused on the impact of the  microsporidia n pathogen  Nosema ceranae , the build-up of which was high in the majority of the bees tested, even after large doses of the antibiotic  fumagillin . Penn State's Dr. Maryann Frazier said, "Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD.

83_7	CAR_578cf30f05b85d1c9df20be4f261a7a050c086e6	In 2006, the  Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group , based primarily at  Pennsylvania State University , was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was the leading cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were the leading cause of colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.
83_7	CAR_666b6f8d6691390605ddc41eba22e7ababd4ee98	Researchers at the USDA Bee Research Laboratory and the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine begin investigating bee feed for the presence of melamine-related compounds as a possible cause of  Colony Collapse Disorder  – the unprecedented die-off of a quarter of the  honeybees  in the United States during 2006 that endangers the human food supply.  Commercial bee feeds are protein-based, containing soy and yeast ingredients; however, no link has been found so far.
83_7	CAR_6b0cd20ef1df8337fdcca72ad5143a699f5ff3f8	Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of  worker   bee s in a colony disappear and leave behind a  queen , plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of  apiculture , and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic rise in the number of disappearances of  western honey bee  (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the  Northern Ireland Assembly  received reports of a decline greater than 50%.
83_7	CAR_6b6cdb836b4bb98b6420ca01889b482e0b885cbb	A 2011 Congressional Research Report describing some of the reasons why scientists believe honey bee colonies are being affected by CCD reported that the  United States Department of Agriculture  had concluded in 2009, "it now seems clear that no single factor alone is responsible for the malady." According to the research report, the neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient  imidacloprid , and similar other chemicals, such as clothianidin and  thiamethoxam , are being studied for a possible link to CCD. Honey bees are thought to possibly be affected by such chemicals, which are known to work their way through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar and pollen that bees forage on. The scientists studying CCD have tested samples of pollen and have indicated findings of a broad range of substances, including insecticides,  fungicides , and  herbicides . They note that the doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but they are concerned about possible chronic problems caused by long-term exposure.
83_7	CAR_72050a2b94a919311c918c0b2337cf5e35ea64cb	Early researchers  commented that the pathway of propagation functions in the manner of a  contagious disease ; however, some sentiment existed that the disorder may involve an  immunosuppressive  mechanism, potentially linked to  "stress" leading to a weakened immune system. Specifically, according to research done in 2007 at the Pennsylvania State University: "The magnitude of detected infectious agents in the adult bees suggests some type of immunosuppression". These researchers initially suggested a connection between  Varroa destructor  mite infestation and CCD, suggesting that a combination of these bee mites,  deformed wing virus  (which the mites transmit) and bacteria work together to suppress immunity and may be one cause of CCD. Parasites, such as varroa mites (Varroa destructor), honey bee tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi), fungal, bacterial and viral diseases, and kleptoparasites such as small hive beetles (Aethina tumida), are all problems that have been introduced within the last 20 years in the continental U.S., and are faced by beekeepers.
83_7	CAR_7e9487f923f93212574605148a2b65c4ad3f153e	One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing  honey bee s (Apis mellifera). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world. The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or  colony collapse disorder  (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577  beekeeper s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists.  Pests ,  pesticide s, and  global warming  are all being considered as possible causes.
83_7	CAR_7e9895c241285aad1cc27c313abb8d7087a1609a	An ecological disaster, such as world crop failure and collapse of  ecosystem services , could be induced by the present trends of  overpopulation ,  economic development , and non- sustainable agriculture . Most of these scenarios involve one or more of the following:  Holocene extinction event ,  scarcity of water  that could lead to approximately one half of the Earth's population being without safe drinking water,  pollinator decline ,  overfishing , massive  deforestation ,  desertification ,  climate change , or massive  water pollution  episodes. A very recent threat in this direction is  colony collapse disorder , a phenomenon that might foreshadow the imminent extinction of the  Western honeybee . As the bee plays a vital role in pollination, its extinction would severely disrupt the food chain.
83_7	CAR_7ee720b0f4594a73cdb5a339d5af8b7d7a9dda2a	According to the USDA, pesticides may be contributing to CCD. A 2013 peer-reviewed literature review concluded neonicotinoids in the amounts typically used harm bees and safer alternatives are urgently needed. At the same time, other sources suggest the evidence is not conclusive, and that clarity regarding the facts is hampered by the role played by various issue advocates and lobby groups.
83_7	CAR_89e7815d14ea61c5db3e1ae88ad7128f613129cc	Imidacloprid was first widely used in the United States in 1996 as it replaced three broad classes of insecticides. In 2006, U.S. commercial migratory beekeepers reported sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Such declines had happened in the past; however unlike the case in previous losses, adult bees were abandoning their hives. Scientists named this phenomenon  colony collapse disorder  (CCD). Reports show that beekeepers in most states have been affected by CCD.  Although no single factor has been identified as causing CCD, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in their progress report on CCD stated that CCD may be "a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically." Several studies have found that sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid increase honey bee susceptibility to the pathogen  Nosema .
83_7	CAR_90b2fc3970f1d04cb73b0fd316a85ab37dc34c96	Perhaps the most confounding possible cause is  colony collapse disorder , where a colony of worker bees suddenly abandons their hive along with their queen bee and a few nurse bees. What makes this phenomenon even more confusing is the lack of bee corpses found around the hive.
83_7	CAR_9c4b73d2d52d14d481d5604133457480f7282a72	In  apiculture  in the United States, HFCS became a sucrose replacement for some  honey bee s starting in the late 1970s. When HFCS is heated to about ,  hydroxymethylfurfural  can form from the breakdown of fructose, and is toxic to bees. One study that followed the concentration of HMF in syrups stored at different temperatures states that past 40 °C the HMF content can dramatically increase. This increase can be predicted by the pH content of the syrup along with other factors. Syrups with higher pH would produce less HMF. HFCS has been investigated as a possible source of  colony collapse disorder . Although some researchers cite it as a cause of CCD, there are also documented reports of CCD occurring with beekeepers who do not feed their bees HFCS. Some researchers also attribute CCD to HFCS that has been produced with genetically modified corn.
83_7	CAR_9e44519bc6b70791867d6771e0f876f94542c5b9	Most beekeepers affected by CCD report that they use  antibiotic s and  miticides  in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals are used makes it seem unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, it is possible that not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides in order to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides for an extended period of time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.
83_7	CAR_9fb068b4dba23d50b8cc6cad6d04eadc446fa58d	According to a 2007 article, the  mite   Varroa destructor  remains the world's most destructive honey bee killer, due in part to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and  acute bee paralysis virus , which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the  immune system  of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the  University of Guelph  in Canada, studied 413  Ontario  bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses which led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.
83_7	CAR_a0e9ebdba7909d1861d6162bbab168e97be042b8	In the United Kingdom, a national bee database was set up in March 2009 to monitor colony collapse as a result of a 15% reduction in the bee population that had taken place over the previous two years. In particular, the register, funded by the  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  and administered by the  National Bee Unit , will be used to monitor health trends and help establish whether the honey industry is under threat from supposed colony collapse disorder. Britain's 20,000 beekeepers have been invited to participate. In October 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers’ Association stated, "We still do not believe CCD is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however we are continuing to experience colony losses, many if not most of which can be explained. The approach being taken in UK beekeeping is to raise the profile of integrated bee health management, in other words identifying and trying to eliminate factors which reduce the health status of a colony. This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions."

The story is centered on the sudden disappearance of  honey bees  from beehives around the world, caused by the poorly understood phenomenon known as  Colony Collapse Disorder  or CCD.  Although the film does not draw any firm scientific conclusions as to the precise cause or causes of CCD, it does suggest a link between  neonicotinoid  pesticides and CCD.
83_7	CAR_b13652369ecb8c8f1723fa27c17591a569b506f7	Pesticides are linked to  Colony Collapse Disorder  and are now considered a main cause, and the toxic effects of  Neonicotinoids  on bees are confirmed. Currently, many studies are being conducted to further understand the toxic effects of pesticides on bees. Agencies such as the  EPA  and  EFSA  are making action plans to protect bee health in response to calls from scientists and the public to ban or limit the use of the pesticides with confirmed toxicity.
83_7	CAR_b4455e38974a3bd36a1c9f8cefdc1010efcc25c7	Industrial apiculture has adopted simple breeding programs for uniform desired traits, and seasonal transportation of colonies over vast distances causes increased infectious exposures from mixing of these domestic and residual displaced wild populations. Brood incubation conditions may be stressful with respect to deficient nutrition, temperature and other basics. This combination of ecological factors, especially the host factor of loss of genetic variation and  hybrid vigor , may account for the apparent multifactorial environmental 'causes' of CCD including concurrent infections.
83_7	CAR_beea96aa3aa082b7938bed743ac040a0ec530765	Colony collapse disorder causes significant economic losses because  many agricultural crops  (although no  staple food s) worldwide are  pollinated  by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the  Food and Agriculture Organization  of the United Nations, the worth of global crops with honey bee's pollination was estimated to be close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the US have increased the cost to farmers renting them for pollination services by up to 20%.
83_7	CAR_c18e80fb172dd612dce49452f50ddd118b54b29f	Fipronil is one of the main chemical causes blamed for the spread of  colony collapse disorder  among bees. It has been found by the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France that even at very low nonlethal doses for bees, the pesticide still impairs their ability to locate their hive, resulting in large numbers of forager bees lost with every pollen-finding expedition. A 2013 report by the  European Food Safety Authority  identified fipronil as "a high acute risk to honeybees when used as a seed treatment for maize and on July 16, 2013 the EU voted to ban the use of fipronil on corn and sunflowers within the EU. The ban took effect at the end of 2013."
83_7	CAR_c1b3734337a1ca415c40be3df3aad6ccc005180a	Colony collapse disorder  is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers. Since  many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees , this represents a threat to the supply of food.
83_7	CAR_c1bcee7ae2957a2acd64bf62980796883f901512	A dramatic rise in the number of annual beehive losses noticed around 2006 spurred interest in factors potentially affecting bee health. When first introduced, neonicotinoids were thought to have low toxicity to many insects, but recent research has suggested a potential toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial insects even with low levels of contact. Neonicotinoids may impact bees’ ability to forage, learn and remember navigation routes to and from food sources. Separate from lethal and sublethal effects solely due to neonicotinoid exposure, neonicotinoids are also being explored with a combination with other factors, such as mites and pathogens, as potential causes of  colony collapse disorder . Neonicotinoids may be responsible for detrimental effects on  bumble bee  colony growth and queen production. For example,  Bombus affinis , a bumblebee endemic to North America, has decreased in nearly 90% of its natural habitats, much of which has been attributed to the use of neonicotoid based pesticides.
83_7	CAR_c36857aa3f67ca9f38224ffd84c6ebcefe936580	When a colony is dying, for whatever cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a  bee yard ), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions for their own use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) is not involved in CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.
83_7	CAR_c958838409329f1769a2405cdad603409be55c94	Apart from colony collapse disorder, losses outside the US have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as  Clothianidin ,  Imidacloprid  and  Thiamethoxam . From 2013 the  European Union  restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of  global warming .
83_7	CAR_c9c5c2b3282c8d6fbd439bdc9892bd3820cb6cea	Neonicotinoids  are one of the leading suspected causes of colony collapse disorder in honey bees. The specific causes are unclear, however, there has been some research to show that neonicotinoids have deleterious health effects on colony queens. Managed honeybee colonies are colonies that are “man-made.” That is, they are not naturally occurring. Rather they are raised and rented out to farmers.
83_7	CAR_ce49d1510429e378a91d159cf8a58b3b0ed891ba	Since it can take decades of studying climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil will be in the more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.
83_7	CAR_d06e5aac04713cc472868379ee312a812d15958d	Varroa mites can only reproduce in a honey bee colony. It attaches to the body of the bee and weakens the bee by sucking  hemolymph . In this process,  RNA virus es such as the  deformed wing virus  (DWV) spread to bees. A significant mite infestation will lead to the death of a honey bee colony, usually in the late autumn through early spring. The Varroa mite is the parasite with the most pronounced economic impact on the  beekeeping  industry. It may be a contributing factor to  colony collapse disorder , as research shows it is the main factor for collapsed colonies in  Ontario , Canada and the United States.
83_7	CAR_d30041223d8d1b433db935a2ac5b9f60cf180b94	This pathogen has been tentatively linked to  colony collapse disorder , a phenomenon reported primarily from the United States, since fall of 2006. Highly preliminary evidence of N. ceranae was reported in a few hives in the Central Valley area of California. "Tests of genetic material taken from a "collapsed colony" in Merced County point to a once-rare microbe that previously affected only Asian bees but might have evolved into a strain lethal to those in Europe and the United States." The researcher did not, however, believe this was conclusive evidence of a link to CCD; "We don't want to give anybody the impression that this thing has been solved." A  USDA  bee scientist has similarly stated, "while the parasite nosema ceranae may be a factor, it cannot be the sole cause. The fungus has been seen before, sometimes in colonies that were healthy." Likewise, a Washington State beekeeper familiar with N. ceranae in his own hives discounts it as being the cause of CCD. In early 2009, Higes et al. reported an association between CCD and N. ceranae was established free of confounding factors, and that weakened colonies treated with  fumagillin  recovered.
83_7	CAR_d863917fe3f0ec32582244ca5ce181f30cb00429	The mechanisms of CCD are still unknown, but many causes are currently being considered, such as  pesticides ,  mite s, fungi, beekeeping practices (such as the use of  antibiotics  or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other  pathogen s, and  immunodeficiencies . The current scientific consensus is that no single factor is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.

Many possible explanations for CCD have been proposed, but no one primary cause has been found. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has indicated in a report to Congress that a combination of factors may be causing CCD, including pesticides, pathogens, and parasites, all of which have been found at high levels in affected bee hives.
83_7	CAR_db4bfde88de0557c44498142cc04239e339f4bf2	Research is beginning to determine the causes of CCD, with the weight of evidence is leaning towards CCD being a  syndrome  rather than a  disease , as it seems to be caused by a combination of various contributing factors rather than a single  pathogen  or  poison . However, in April 2013, after a report was released by the  European Food Safety Authority  identifying the significant risks of the class of pesticides called  neonicotinoids , the  European Union  called for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid pesticides. In 2015, an 11-year British study showed a definitive relationship between increasing agricultural use of neonicotinoid and escalating honey bee colony losses at a landscape level. This is the first field study to establish a link between neonicotinoids and CCD.

He is currently the research leader at the  United States Department of Agriculture 's Beltsville Bee Laboratory (BBL). His research has led to significant breakthroughs in understanding and managing  CCD , a primary cause of North American bee population decline. He is also known for discovering with  Dennis vanEngelsdorp  of  Pennsylvania State University  the ability of bees to detect pesticides and harmful fungi in collected pollen and subsequently quarantine the harmful substances from the rest of the hive. His research has also studied the synergistic effects of  Imidacloprid  on bees, an insecticide derived from nicotine which has been shown to cause CCD.

It is conjectured that  Dicistroviridae , like the IAPV, cause degradation of the  ribosome s, which are responsible for  protein production  of  cells , and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to factors that might not otherwise be lethal.
83_7	CAR_fffab339e95e447c4d3104ec351aacc6a8b43121	In July 2007, the  United States Department of Agriculture  (USDA) released its "CCD Action Plan", which outlined a strategy for addressing CCD consisting of four main components: survey and data collection; analysis of samples; hypothesis-driven research; mitigation and preventive action. The first annual report of the U.S. Colony Collapse Disorder Steering Committee was published in 2009. It suggested CCD may be caused by the interaction of many agents in combination. The same year, the CCD Working Group published a comprehensive descriptive study that concluded: "Of the 61 variables quantified (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single factor was found with enough consistency to suggest one causal agent. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with more pathogens than control populations, suggesting either greater pathogen exposure or reduced defenses in CCD bees."

83_7	MARCO_1339637	Theories about the causes of Colony Collapse Disorder, or CCD, emerged almost as quickly as the bees disappeared. No single cause or definitive answer has yet been identified.Most researchers expect the answer to lie in a combination of contributing factors. Here are ten possible causes of Colony Collapse Disorder.ny disappearance of an insect species would implicate pesticide use as a potential cause, and CCD is no exception. Beekeepers are particularly concerned about a possible connection between Colony Collapse Disorder and neonicotinoids, or nicotine-based pesticides.
83_7	MARCO_1339639	Colony collapse disorder causes significant economic losses because many agricultural crops (although no staple foods) worldwide are pollinated by western honey bees.uropean beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.

83_7	MARCO_1339643	In the fall of 2006, beekeepers in North America began reporting the disappearances of entire colonies of bees, seemingly overnight. In the U.S. alone, thousands of bee colonies were lost to Colony Collapse Disorder.ny disappearance of an insect species would implicate pesticide use as a potential cause, and CCD is no exception. Beekeepers are particularly concerned about a possible connection between Colony Collapse Disorder and neonicotinoids, or nicotine-based pesticides.
83_7	MARCO_1339644	In the fall of 2006, beekeepers began reporting the disappearances of entire colonies of honey bees. Scientists named this phenomenon Colony Collapse Disorder, or CCD. Answer: Colony Collapse Disorder refers to the complete absence of adult honey bees in a colony, with few or no dead adults remaining behind.Though the adult honey bees are gone, the hive will contain capped brood and food stores.eekeepers should be alert to the signs that a colony may collapse: insufficient numbers of worker bees to care for the brood; young adult workers present, but no older workers in the colony; and unwillingness of the bees to accept food from the beekeeper. The queen will still be present.
83_7	MARCO_3195648	Neonicotinoids are especially effective against sap-feeding insects like aphids. Neonicotinoids are a new class of insecticides chemically related to nicotine. The name literally means ânew nicotine-like insecticidesâ.Like nicotine, the neonicotinoids act on certain kinds of receptors in the nerve synapse. They are much more toxic to invertebrates, like insects, than they are to mammals, birds and other higher organisms.he problem with the hypothesis that neonicotinoids are a primary cause of CCD is that researchers are not finding good or consistent correlations between these insecticides and CCD (see http://www.usda.gov/documents/ReportHoneyBeeHealth.pdf).
83_7	MARCO_3867576	From what I understand, it's not as much that they are dying. Global bee populations appear stable and actually are growing. But specific types of bee's have been suffering from what is known as colony collapse disorder (CCD), which is where the bees do not appear to actually die, but just disappear.
83_7	MARCO_4605701	Proposed culprits of bee colony collapse disorder include: Pesticides and insecticidesâNicotinoids such as Imidacloprid and Clothianidin kills insects by attacking their nervous systems. These are known to get into pollen and nectar, and can damage beneficial insects such as bees.

Loss of pollinators means a reduction in  crop yield s. Sublethal doses of insecticides (i.e. imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids) affect bee foraging behavior. However, research into the causes of CCD was inconclusive as of June 2007.

Beginning in 2006, beekeepers in the United States began to report unexplained losses of hives — 30 percent and upward — leading to a phenomenon called  colony collapse disorder  (CCD). The cause of CCD remains under debate, but scientific consensus is beginning to emerge suggesting that there is no one cause but rather a combination of factors including lack of foraging plants, infections, breeding, and pesticides—with none catastrophic on their own, but having a synergistic effect when occurring in combination.
83_8	CAR_628af7691b6ce93928fb537baf3a7e566151d233	A 2007–2008 survey of over 19% of all colonies revealed a total loss of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, the same number of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations were more likely to have this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.
83_8	CAR_652e1c4654a2cce7d24d500297543a91095bb6f2	From 1945 to 2005, bee colonies have decreased from around 6,000,000 colonies to less than 3,000,000 colonies.  Bees pollinate around 70% of the world's crops, and on average, about one in every three bites of food humans consume has been pollinated by a bee.  If the bees were to die out, pollination rates would plummet, likely resulting in less food and skyrocketing market prices.

As it turns out, the sudden, massive stockpile of honey has put every bee out of a job, including the vitally important Pollen Jocks. As a result, without anything to pollinate them, the world's flowers slowly begin to die out. Before long, the only flowers left with healthy pollen are those in a flower parade in  Pasadena, California . Barry and Vanessa travel to the parade and steal a parade float, which they load onto a plane to be delivered to the bees so they can re-pollinate the world's flowers. When the plane's pilot and copilot are  knocked unconscious , Vanessa is forced to land the plane, with help from Barry and the bees from Barry's hive.
83_8	CAR_7e9487f923f93212574605148a2b65c4ad3f153e	One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing  honey bee s (Apis mellifera). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world. The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or  colony collapse disorder  (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577  beekeeper s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists.  Pests ,  pesticide s, and  global warming  are all being considered as possible causes.

83_8	CAR_d996ef0d2891c95b167f0b67e58a1ddb0e4991a7	The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms  pollinated  by insects such as  beetle s, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are  specialized  as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of  coevolution , flowers developed floral rewards such as  nectar  and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as  scopal hairs  and  pollen baskets  to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have  scopal hairs  located on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess  pollen baskets  on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the  adaptive radiation  of the  angiosperms , and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be  mutualistc .

83_8	MARCO_8119561	Honey bees are going extinct because of excessive use of pesticides in crops and certain blood-sucking parasites that only reproduce in bee colonies. Itâs true that the extinction of bees would mean the end of humanity. For many of us, honeybees are annoying.
83_8	MARCO_8266703	Where would we be without bees? As far as important species go, they are top of the list. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. Honey bees are responsible for $30 billion a year in crops. Thatâs only the start. We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables. It gets worse. We are losing bees at an alarming rate.
83_8	MARCO_8266710	The variety of foods available would diminish, and the cost of certain products would surge. The California Almond Board, for example, has been campaigning to save bees for years. Without bees and their ilk, the group says, almonds âsimply wouldnât exist.â Weâd still have coffee without bees, but it would become expensive and rare. The coffee flower is only open for pollination for three or four days.
83_8	MARCO_8266711	Life Without Bees. Bees are a key determinant of our lifestyle and diet which, however, remains unrecognized by many. If one day bees significantly decline or go extinct, this will have a drastic impact on the economy, our relationships, peopleâs lifestyle and diet, whether we want it or not. Quite often the first thing that comes to mind when one hears the word bee, is honey. Nice, tasty, healthy and sweet honey.
83_8	MARCO_8303038	With the frequent die-offs of. the European honey bee in recent years, preserving our native pollinators has. increased in importance. Among the bees that make nests in the. ground, are bumble bees, in the family. Apidae, which mostly nest in pre-existing. cavities, dug by rodents or other small. animals. Bumble bees are social, with. colonies started anew each year by an. overwintered queen bee.
83_8	MARCO_8452507	Only 13 absolutely require animal pollination, while 30 more are âhighly dependentâ on it. Production of the remaining crops would likely continue without bees with only slightly lower yields. So if honeybees did disappear for good, humans would probably not go extinct (at least not solely for that reason). But our diets would still suffer tremendously. The variety of foods available would diminish, and the cost of certain products would surge. The California Almond Board, for example, has been campaigning to save bees for years.
83_8	MARCO_8452508	Without bees and their ilk, the group says, almonds âsimply wouldnât exist.â Weâd still have coffee without bees, but it would become expensive and rare. The coffee flower is only open for pollination for three or four days. If no insect happens by in that short window, the plant wonât be pollinated. There are plenty of other examples: apples, avocados, onions, and several types of berries rely heavily on bees for pollination. The disappearance of honeybees, or even a substantial drop in their population, would make those foods scarce.
83_8	MARCO_8452512	Quick Answer. Deteriorating bee populations, or their extinction, may have a devastating effect on a wide range of agricultural and other plant life the world over. In particular, the disappearance of the honeybee may drastically reduce the number of crops any given country has the capacity to produce.

Seed funding involves a higher risk than normal venture capital funding since the investor does not see any existing projects to evaluate for funding. Hence, the investments made are usually lower (in the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands of dollars range) as against normal venture capital investment (in the hundreds of thousands to the millions of dollars range), for similar levels of stake in the company. Seed funding can be raised online using  equity crowdfunding  platforms such as  SeedInvest ,  Seedrs  and  Angels Den . Investors make their decision whether to fund a project based on the perceived strength of the idea and the capabilities, skills and history of the founders.

Beyond founders' own contributions, some startups raise additional investment at some or several stages of their growth. Not all startups trying to raise investments are successful in their fundraising. The solicitation of funds became easier for startups as result of the  JOBS Act . Prior to the advent of  equity crowdfunding , a form of online investing that has been legalized in several nations, startups did not advertise themselves to the general public as investment opportunities until and unless they first obtained approval from regulators for an  initial public offering  (IPO) that typically involved a listing of the startup's securities on a  stock exchange . Today, there are many alternative forms of IPO commonly employed by startups and startup promoters that do not include an exchange listing, so they may avoid certain regulatory compliance obligations, including mandatory periodic disclosures of financial information and factual  discussion of business conditions by management  that investors and potential investors routinely receive from registered public companies.

Blue Startups appeared on a list of the top 20 "America's top tech accelerators" by The Seed Accelerator Rankings Project, and was selected by Yael Hochberg, Susan Cohen, and Dan Fehder. The company ranked at number 17. It was selected among "150 accelerators, fixed-term, cohort-based programs." An editor for  CNNMoney  named Hawaii one of the top 10 most entrepreneurial states. In this article, the author cited companies like Blue Startups as an example of companies who are "mentoring an expanding network of Internet, software, mobile, and e-commerce firms." The company's services are valued at more than $500,000. Pacific Business News editor Stephanie Silverstein noted that while two other startup companies were having difficulties with money and management, Blue Startups was "off to a strong start." Brandon Bennett, CEO of Happy Hour Pal (one of the companies accepted into Blue Startups through its cohort program), praised Blue Startups for being accommodating to his company and noted that the business atmosphere between him and other startup owners was good. Sagely, one of the companies from Blue Startups' fourth cohort, stated that "the opportunities offered by Blue Startups would be impossible to do on your own." Blue Startups' first three cohorts, as of July 22, 2014, have managed to raise more than $6 million in investment capital. Business owner  Arben Kryeziu  seemed to have an "adamant" desire to fund companies that came out of Blue Startups' cohort programs, as noted by author Evan Nagle. Kryeziu noted that his business, which is similar to Blue Startups, will exist in the area to add to the Hawaiian startup efforts rather than compete in it.

Venture capital  firms and  angel investor s may help startup companies begin operations, exchanging  seed money  for an  equity  stake in the firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing to a range of startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that a very small number of the start-ups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using " bootstrapping ", in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and  credit card  debt to finance the venture.  Factoring  is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of  crowdfunding , for example  equity crowdfunding , in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the  Internet

Although it is usually difficult to raise more than a few hundred thousand dollars from friends and family, most traditional venture capital funds are usually not able to make or evaluate small investments under US$1–2 million. Thus, angel investment is a common second round of financing for high-growth start-ups, and accounts in total for almost as much money invested annually as all venture capital funds combined, but into more than 60 times as many companies (US$20.1 billion vs. $23.26 billion in the US in 2010, into 61,900 companies vs. 1,012 companies).

As such, they require a very high  return on investment . Because a large percentage of angel investments are lost completely when early stage companies fail, professional angel investors seek investments that have the potential to return at least ten or more times their original investment within 5 years, through a defined  exit strategy , such as plans for an  initial public offering  or an  acquisition . Current 'best practices' suggest that angels might do better setting their sights even higher, looking for companies that will have at least the potential to provide a 20x-30x return over a five- to seven-year holding period. After taking into account the need to cover failed investments and the multi-year holding time for even the successful ones, however, the actual effective  internal rate of return  for a typical successful portfolio of angel investments is, in reality, typically as 'low' as 20–30%. While the investor's need for high rates of return on any given investment can thus make angel financing an expensive source of funds, cheaper sources of capital, such as  bank  financing, are usually not available for most early-stage ventures.

Seed funding involves a higher risk than normal venture capital funding since the investor does not see any existing projects to evaluate for funding. Hence, the investments made are usually lower (in the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands of dollars range) as against normal venture capital investment (in the hundreds of thousands to the millions of dollars range), for similar levels of stake in the company. Seed funding can be raised online using  equity crowdfunding  platforms such as  SeedInvest ,  Seedrs  and  Angels Den .

At this level  angel investors  will be the ones participating. The next round is called  Series A . At this point the company already has traction and may be making revenue. In Series A rounds venture capital firms will be participating alongside angels or  super angel  investors. The next rounds are  Series B , C, and D. These three rounds are the ones leading towards the  IPO . Venture capital firms and  private equity  firms will be participating.

Venture capital  firms and  angel investor s may help startup companies begin operations, exchanging  seed money  for an  equity  stake in the firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing to a range of startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that a very small number of the start-ups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using " bootstrapping ", in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and  credit card  debt to finance the venture.  Factoring  is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of  crowdfunding , for example  equity crowdfunding , in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the  Internet

84_3	CAR_dc9f9650520a47574a6fc0a0e7af22a5f2043219	For crowdfunding of equity stock purchases, there is some research in social psychology that indicates that, like in all investments, people don't always do their due diligence to determine if it's a sound investment before investing, which leads to making investment decisions based on emotion rather than financial logic. By using crowdfunding, creators also forgo potential support and value that a single angel investor or venture capitalist might offer. Likewise, crowdfunding requires that creators manage their investors. This can be time consuming and financially burdensome as the number of investors in the crowd rises. Crowdfunding draws a crowd: investors and other interested observers who follow the progress, or lack of progress, of a project. Sometimes it proves easier to raise the money for a project than to make the project a success. Managing communications with a large number of possibly disappointed investors and supporters can be a substantial, and potentially diverting, task.
84_3	CAR_e4619747e10e10bb960487dc8dbdc5ef70ef85e3	The investor-led crowdfunding model differentiates itself from the usual company-led model by necessitating the participation of an experienced  business angel  in every round. This 'lead investor' conducts due diligence on the investment opportunity and negotiates the economic terms of the investment before contributing at least 25% of the round. The intended benefit is that any less experienced investors will 1) have the reassurance of knowing that an experienced investor has already assessed the round and 2) invest on the same economic terms as the lead investor.

84_3	CAR_fbe40a761b27a1764680c6cb3b57f9edf3b1a8bb	There are also financial benefits to the creator. For one, crowdfunding allows creators to attain low-cost capital. Traditionally, a creator would need to look to "personal savings, home equity loans, personal credit cards, friends and family members, angel investors, and venture capitalists." With crowdfunding, creators can find funders from around the world, sell both their product and equity, and benefit from increased information flow. Additionally, crowdfunding that supports pre-buying allows creators to obtain early feedback on the product. Proponents of the crowdfunding approach argue that it allows good ideas which do not fit the pattern required by conventional financiers to break through and attract cash through the  wisdom of the crowd . If it does achieve "traction" in this way, not only can the enterprise secure seed funding to begin its project, but it may also secure evidence of backing from potential customers and benefit from  word of mouth  promotion in order to reach the fundraising goal. Another potential positive effect is the propensity of groups to "produce an accurate aggregate prediction" about market outcomes as identified by author  James Surowiecki  in his book  The Wisdom of Crowds , thereby placing financial backing behind ventures likely to succeed.

In contrast to traditional venture capital which is money used to invest in companies looking to fund growth (also referred to as a  Series A round  of funding), micro venture capital consists of smaller seed investments, typically between $25K to $500K, in companies that have yet to gain traction.

Unless small businesses have collateral and can prove revenue, banks are hesitant to lend money. Often times start up companies and businesses operating for less than a year do not have collateral and private money lenders or angel investors are a better option.

A major route is through  initial public offering  (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed.

Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the  net present value  of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the  First chicago method  which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.

In exchange for the high  risk  that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the companies' ownership (and consequently value). Start-ups like Uber, Airbnb, Flipkart, ReviewAdda, Xiaomi & Didi Chuxing are highly valued startups, where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these early-stage firms; they also often provide strategic advice to the firm's executives on its  business model  and marketing strategies.

However, this participation is usually limited to some areas, such as recruitment, fund raising, or PR relations.
84_6	CAR_a41c4c4dd3dc4ac8dd1372c1c6fd99e80c691e33	Startups have several options for funding.  Venture capital  firms and  angel investor s may help startup companies begin operations, exchanging  seed money  for an  equity  stake in the firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing to a range of startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that a very small number of the start-ups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using " bootstrapping ", in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and  credit card  debt to finance the venture.  Factoring  is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of  crowdfunding , for example  equity crowdfunding , in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the  Internet

Lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business. Venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business. The return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business. This return is generally earned when the venture capitalist "exits" by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner.
84_6	CAR_c952ea685d4f2567d65df23bfc4b92f3850bd970	The second hallmark of corporate VC investments is the extent to which companies in the investment portfolio are linked to the investing company's current operational abilities. For example, a start-up with strong links to the investing company might make use of that company's manufacturing plants, distribution channels, technology, or brand. It might adopt the investing company's business practices to build, sell, or service its products.  An external venture may offer the investing company an opportunity to build new and different capabilities—ones that could threaten the viability of current corporate capabilities. Housing these capabilities in a separate legal entity can insulate them from internal efforts to undermine them. If the venture and its processes fare well, the corporation can then evaluate whether and how to adapt its own processes to be more like those of the start-up. Although it happens far less than commonly thought, the CVC parent company may attempt to acquire the new venture.

In 1983 he moved to  Italy  with a letter of recommendation by  Juan Manuel Fangio  in order to pursue his dream of building a  supercar . At the age of 20, Pagani had designed and built his first  F3 racer . He was a chief engineer at  Lamborghini  and he built the  Countach Evoluzione  concept. He tried to persuade Lamborghini to buy an  autoclave  so they could extend the production of the carbon parts for the Evoluzione. They refused, saying that neither did Ferrari have an autoclave, nor did Lamborghini need one. Pagani borrowed the capital to buy his own autoclave late in 1987 and then, in 1991, he broke away from the company and founded his own consultancy called  Modena Design  which continues to make carbon fiber composites for  Formula One  cars and clients like  Daimler ,  Ferrari  and  Aprilia  .
85_2	CAR_37c9d4bea7fc5c026f13522b154d6e2a1d66629e	The GT4 was a groundbreaking model for Ferrari in several ways: it was the first production Ferrari to feature the mid-engined V8 layout that would become the bulk of the company's business in the succeeding decades, and was the first production Ferrari with  Bertone  (rather than  Pininfarina ) designed bodywork. Pininfarina was upset by the decision to give cross-town rival Bertone the design, considering all they had done for Ferrari. The styling featured angular lines entirely different from its curvaceous 2-seater brother, the  Dino 246 , and was controversial at the time. Some journalists compared it to the Bertone-designed  Lancia Stratos  and  Lamborghini Urraco , also penned by Marcello Gandini.From the cockpit the driver sees only the road. It has perfect 360 degree visibility, no blind spots, upright and comfortable seating position, a real trunk, a back seat for soft luggage, and very easy engine access. Enzo Ferrari himself took a major role in its design, even having a mock-up made where he could sit in the car to test different steering, pedals and cockpit seating positioning.

The cars on the video are a black  Ferrari F355  Berlinetta, a purple  Lamborghini Diablo SE30  and a red  Ferrari F40 .  Jay Kay  appears to be driving the purple Lamborghini with  Stuart Zender  on the co-pilot seat, but the drivers of the other cars are not shown in detail. It has four different edits: Versions 1–3, and the so-called 'Jay's cut' version. Before filming, Jay's Diablo had to be shipped overseas for the video shoot. Apparently, the company which was hired to transport the car had a driver that was keen to drive the car. Jay let the guy drive the car, but he was involved in an accident which wrecked the car, rendering the $239,000 car completely unusable. The car that appears in the video was rented from a local collector. The F40 was provided by the  Pink Floyd  drummer  Nick Mason , who drove in the video as well. While filming, the driver's side window in Jay Kay's Lamborghini was accidentally smashed. Due to the tight timescales involved, the video was still shot, but with the window removed. This is why Jay Kay appears to be driving around the desert late at night with his windows down. Jay Kay mentioned in an interview that the Lamborghini had its windscreen removed to aid with the filming, due to space limitations inside, and the windscreen angle from outside. The missing windscreen can be seen when the Lamborghini overtakes the black Ferrari on an uphill shot. The video was filmed at the  Cabo de Gata , in Spain.

The silicon reacts with the graphite in the carbon-carbon composite to become carbon-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC). These discs are used on some road-going sports cars, supercars, as well as other performance cars including the  Porsche Carrera GT , the  Bugatti Veyron , the  Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 ,  Bentley s,  Ferrari s,  Lamborghini s, some specific high performance  Audi s, and the  McLaren P1 .

He had previously expressed dissatisfaction with Ferrari's  aftersales service , which he perceived to be substandard. Lamborghini brought his misgivings to  Enzo Ferrari 's attention, but was dismissed by the notoriously pride-filled  Modena n. After successfully modifying one of his personally-owned Ferrari 250GTs to outperform stock models, Lamborghini gained the impetus to pursue an automobile manufacturing venture of his own, aiming to create the perfect  touring car  that he felt no one could build for him. Lamborghini believed that a  grand tourer  should have attributes that were lacking in Ferrari's offerings, namely high performance without compromising  tractability , ride quality, and interior appointments. A clever businessman, Lamborghini also knew that he could make triple the profit if the components used in his tractors were installed in a high-performance exotic car instead.
85_2	CAR_dfb14988e096839c4dad8a3d804241f44012b780	Prior to founding his company, Lamborghini had commissioned the engineering firm  Società Autostar  to design a V12 engine for use in his new cars. Lamborghini wanted the engine to have a similar  displacement  to Ferrari's 3-litre V12; however, he wanted the engine to be designed purely for road use, in contrast to the modified racing engines used by Ferrari in its road cars. Autostar was led by  Giotto Bizzarrini , a member of the "Gang of Five" of Ferrari engineers, who had been responsible for creating the famous  Ferrari 250 GTO , but left the company in 1961 after founder  Enzo Ferrari  announced his intention to reorganize the engineering staff. The engine Bizzarrini designed, known today as the  Lamborghini V12 , had a displacement of 3.5 litres, a 9.5:1 compression ratio, and a maximum output of 360 bhp at 9800 rpm. Lamborghini was displeased with the engine's high revolutions and  dry-sump lubrication  system, both characteristic of the racing engines he specifically did not wish to use; when Bizzarrini refused to change the engine's design to make it more "well-mannered", Lamborghini refused to pay the agreed-upon fee of 4.5 million  Italian lire  (plus a bonus for every unit of  brake horsepower  the engine could produce over the equivalent Ferrari engine). Lamborghini did not fully compensate the designer until ordered to do so by the  courts , a terrific irony considering variants of Bizzarrini's V12 design were used by Lamborghini automobiles for nearly half a century, from 1963 to 2010.

In 2012, under pressure from food truck owners and supporters, including the University of Chicago Law School, regulations were changed to allow on-board cooking, however, controversially, food trucks are required to park 200 feet away from any restaurant, which virtually eliminates busy downtown locations.

In winter, daily temperatures in the southwest are cooler with highs in the 60s and lows in the 30s and 40s.[citation needed]In Phoenix, Las Vegas and similar Southwestern desert areas, June is often the driest month, after Pacific-originating winter storms have concluded and before the Southwestern summer "monsoon" begins. The Southwest and the Great Basin are affected by said monsoon from the Gulf of California from July–September. This results in some increase in humidity and cloud cover, bringing higher nighttime low temperatures and localized thunderstorms to the region, which can result in flash flooding. Further eastward in the desert Southwest (Tucson, AZ eastward toward El Paso, TX), winter-season precipitation decreases, while the summer monsoon increasingly provides a summer precipitation maximum. For example, El Paso has a pronounced July to September precipitation maximum. Still, drought has been frequent in the region, often lasting for periods of years or longer. Forest fires across the Western United States (especially the southwest) occur annually.[citation needed]Northern Arizona and New Mexico, central and northern Nevada and most of Utah (outside higher mountain areas) have a temperate semi-desert to desert climate, but with colder and snowier winters than in Phoenix and similar areas, and less-hot summers. Summer high temperatures often reach the 90s, but low temperatures drop into the low 60s and even 50s. As in other temperate desert climates, the dry air results in large differences (sometimes over 40 degrees) between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures. Precipitation, though scarce, often falls year-round, influenced both by summer thunderstorms brought by the Southwestern monsoon (primarily in southern areas), and by winter-season storms from the Pacific Ocean.[citation needed]

Its climate is very mild when compared to the rest of Utah, and typical of the  Mojave Desert , in which it lies. Situated below the Black Ridge and the Hurricane Cliffs, in the northeastern edge of the Mojave Desert. It was part of Mexico and settled by the Southern Paiutes. It was first inhabited by Mormon settlers in 1854, as part of  Brigham Young 's efforts to establish an Indian Mission in the region.  The settlers began growing cotton and other temperate  cash crop s during the later 1850s on land that had fed the Paiute.  The Paiute population was decimated as a result of starvation and disease. The largest community in the region,  St. George , was founded in 1861, when  Brigham Young  selected 300 families to take over the area and grow cotton, grapes, and other crops. The region was nicknamed Dixie by 1860.

At locations south, in Arizona, the climate is so dry that erosion is relatively slow. Further north, the wetter climates encourage growth of forests, which destroy fossils by the actions of roots and soil bacteria. In southern Utah, there are enough strong and wet storms to cause episodic rapid erosion and the consequent exposure of fossil remains, but with insufficient annual average rainfall to support destructive deep rooted plant life.

During the games, other scandals erupted over  contested judging scores  and illegal drug use. Despite the controversies, the games were heralded as a financial success, being one of the few in recent history to profit. In preparation major construction projects were initiated. Local  freeway s were expanded and repaired, and a light rail system was constructed. Olympic venues are now used for local, national, and international sporting events and Olympic athlete training. Tourism has increased since the Olympic games, but business did not pick up immediately following them. Salt Lake City expressed interest in bidding for the  2022 Winter Olympics . However,  Beijing  was selected to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.
86_4	CAR_ddd485a96d6c2d3fa6310fb9b8c32871a77d12e3	Like the  Utah Olympic Oval  and  Soldier Hollow , the park was designed and built specifically for the Olympic games, under the supervision of the  Salt Lake Organizing Committee  (SLOC). The 1989 Olympic referendum, which was passed by Utahns, allowed for tax payer money to fund a winter sports park, which would be used if Salt Lake City won its bid for either the 1998 or 2002 Winter Olympics; Olympic funds and revenue would then be used to repay the state. In 1990 the Utah Sports Authority announced their plans to build the park, which included ski jumps and a bobsled-luge track, in Bear Hollow near Park City. Before construction on the park began, it faced criticism from local landowners and citizens of  Summit County , concerned over traffic and environmental effects. Construction got underway following a groundbreaking ceremony on May 29, 1991. The original estimated cost of the park was $26.3 million and included the ski jumps, bobsled-luge track, and a day lodge, all to be completed by September 1992. The majority of the park was designed and engineered by Eckhoff, Watson and Preator Engineering and its joint venture partner, Van Boerum & Frank Associates, all of Salt Lake City.

According to the study "2002 Olympic Winter Games, Economic, Demographic and Fiscal Impacts," the estimated creation of new job years of employment was 35,424, and additional earnings of $1,544,203,000. It was noted that the increase of Olympic related job started in 1996 and continued till 2003. These effects can be estimated on the ground of historical relationship between job and corresponding population growth. A lot of people migrated into the future place of the  Olympic Games  for expanding and favorable employment opportunities that the Olympics ensured.  Although many of the higher paying jobs created by the Games were occupied by residents, many of the vacated jobs were filled by immigrants who relocated for the better employment opportunities.

The poem has been translated into English by  David Hawkes  as "In Praise of the Orange-Tree". In the poem, the orange-tree is used as a metaphor for certain human qualities, such as "steadfastness". Hawkes explains this by the tradition that this type of orange tree is supposed to grow naturally only in the part of China of which the ancient  land of Chu  was included in (as opposed to the northern plain). The particular orange-tree (ju) mentioned is what David Hawkes calls "citrus nobilis"; but, this type of orange (or, its hybrids) is now usually botanically referred to as Citrus reticulata, or else by the common name of " mandarin orange ".

The tissues may be partially fused together following  grafting  to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot. Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their periclinal chimeras is like to be highly variable.The first such known chimera was probably the  Bizzaria  which is a fusion of the  Florentine citron  and the  sour orange . Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are  Laburnocytisus 'Adamii' , caused by a fusion of a  Laburnum  and a  broom , and "Family" trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a  rootstock .

The orange tree is an  evergreen ,  flowering  tree, with an average height of , although some very old specimens can reach . Its oval  leaves ,  alternately arranged , are  long and have  crenulate  margins. Although the sweet orange presents different sizes and shapes varying from spherical to oblong, it generally has ten segments ( carpel s) inside, and contains up to six seeds (or pips) and a porous white tissue – called  pith  or, more properly,  mesocarp  or albedo—lines its rind. When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet orange is non- climacteric . The Citrus sinensis is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.

Many growers purchased bud wood and then grafted the cuttings to root stock. Within a few years, the successful cultivation of many thousands of the newly discovered Brazilian navel orange led to a California  Gold Rush  of a different kind: the establishment of the citrus industry, which is commemorated in the landscapes and exhibits of the  California Citrus State Historic Park  and the restored packing houses in the downtown's Marketplace district. By 1882, there were more than half a million citrus trees in California, almost half of which were in Riverside. The development of refrigerated  railroad car s and innovative irrigation systems established Riverside as the richest city in the United States (in terms of income per capita) by 1895.

There is general agreement that the arrival of the sweet orange in Europe was linked with the activities of the Portuguese during the fifteenth century, and particularly by  Vasco de Gama 's voyages to the East. Although the  Romans  had been acquainted with lemons and probably  sour oranges  as well as citrons, the different types - sour oranges,  lemon s and sweet  oranges  - reached Europe centuries apart. By withholding water and nutrients, and by using pruning techniques, French gardeners were able to make citrus trees bloom throughout the year, to the delight of Louis XIV. Citrus motifs formed themes in sculpture, mosaics, embroidery, weaving, paintings, poems, and songs throughout history, and orange blossoms remain prized as floral ornaments at weddings.

Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets.  Orange blossom  is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. Orange blossom can be described as smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred to with different names, is a result of the process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of  enfleurage .

87_2	CAR_8fa6c7259ed9e14898fcf18cc91b22606a650054	The navel orange was not new when Tibbets introduced it to United States agriculture. A kind of navel was described and pictured by John Baptisti Ferrarius in 1646. Early Brazilian publications often referred to the Navel orange, or lavanja de ombigo. The Washington navel is sterile – truly  seedless  and utterly devoid of  pollen  with  pistil s deformed in a way that makes seed production from the pollen of other varieties impossible. Hence, the Washington navel orange is propagated by  grafting  a bud from an existing tree onto separate (genetically distinct)  rootstock . The Washington Navel orange is particularly prone to a type of  mutation  in which one branch or "sport" differs genetically from the rest of the tree. It first appeared as a sport on a Selecta sweet orange tree in Bahia, Brazil. A desirable sport like this enables growers to avoid the complications of genetic segregation and recombination by spreading the species through  asexual propagation . Although asexual propagation required a certain amount of effort and level of expertise, this sport was extensively propagated in the vicinity of Bahia. Nowadays many important fruit crops are propagated asexually, including oranges, grapes, avocados, bananas and apples. In fact, all commercial citrus trees are grafted onto rootstock selected for adaptation to the soil, resistance to disease, and influence on fruit quality.

Nevertheless, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside, has suggested that the parent variety was more likely the Portuguese navel orange (Umbigo), described by  Antoine Risso  and  Pierre Antoine Poiteau  in their book Histoire naturelle des orangers ("Natural History of Orange Trees", 1818–1822). The mutation caused the orange to develop a second fruit at its base, opposite the stem, embedded within the peel of the primary orange. Navel oranges were introduced in Australia in 1824 and in Florida in 1835. In 1870, twelve cuttings of the original tree were transplanted to Riverside, California, where the fruit became known as "Washington". This cultivar was very successful, and rapidly spread to other countries. Because the mutation left the fruit seedless and, therefore, sterile, the only method to cultivate navel oranges was to graft cuttings onto other varieties of citrus trees. The  California Citrus State Historic Park  and the  Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center  preserve the history of navel oranges in Riverside.

When the Washington navel orange was publicly displayed at a fair in 1879, the valuable commercial characteristics of the fruit, including their quality, shape, size, color, texture, and seedlessness, were immediately recognized. Tibbets' orange was also ideally suited to Riverside's semiarid weather, and its thick skin enabled it to be packed and shipped. The contrast between this new fruit and that of seedling trees was so striking that most new grove plantings were of Washington navel oranges. Tibbets sold budwood from her trees to local nurserymen, which led to extensive plantings of nursery trees cloned from hers. Since then Washington navel orange budwood and trees have been taken from California across the seas to Japan, Australia, South Africa, and other tropical or semi-tropical districts.

87_7	CAR_17818109b7a798085b34d528c7ab7b62cd95f945	According to a 1917 study by  Palemon Dorsett ,  Archibald Dixon Shamel  and  Wilson Popenoe  of the  United States Department of Agriculture  (USDA), a single  mutation  in a Selecta orange tree planted on the grounds of a monastery near  Bahia , Brazil, probably yielded the first navel orange between 1810 and 1820. Nevertheless, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside, has suggested that the parent variety was more likely the Portuguese navel orange (Umbigo), described by  Antoine Risso  and  Pierre Antoine Poiteau  in their book Histoire naturelle des orangers ("Natural History of Orange Trees", 1818–1822). The mutation caused the orange to develop a second fruit at its base, opposite the stem, embedded within the peel of the primary orange. Navel oranges were introduced in Australia in 1824 and in Florida in 1835. In 1870, twelve cuttings of the original tree were transplanted to Riverside, California, where the fruit became known as "Washington". This cultivar was very successful, and rapidly spread to other countries. Because the mutation left the fruit seedless and, therefore, sterile, the only method to cultivate navel oranges was to graft cuttings onto other varieties of citrus trees. The  California Citrus State Historic Park  and the  Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center  preserve the history of navel oranges in Riverside.

87_7	CAR_b378f5eaae56128f79a156d4c67ca60622c0072e	Single strength orange juice (SSOJ) can either be “not from concentrate” (NFC) orange juice or juice that is reconstituted from a concentrate with the addition of water to reach a specific single strength brix level. The processing of SSOJ also begins with the selection of orange. The most common types of orange used to produce orange juice are the Pineapple orange, Valencia orange, and Washington Navel oranges from Florida and California. The manufacturing journey begins when oranges are delivered to processing plants by trucks holding about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds of fruit. The fruit is unloaded at the plant for inspection and grading to remove unsuitable fruit before the oranges enter the storage bins. An automatic sampler contraption removes oranges for determination of acid and soluble solids. The bins are organized based on ratio of soluble solids to acids in order to blend oranges appropriate to produce juice with uniform flavor. After the fruit leaves the bins, they are scrubbed with detergent on a rotary brush washer and subsequently rinsed with potable water. Throughout the processing stages, there are multiple points with facilities that inspect oranges and discard damaged fruit. The oranges then go through roller conveyors, which expose all sides of the fruit. The roller conveyors are efficiently built as they are well lighted, installed at a convenient height, and width to ensure all inspectors can reach the fruit to determine inadequacies. Some reasons why fruit may be rejected include indication of mold, rot, and ruptured peels. Afterwards, the oranges are separated based on size through machines prior to juice extraction. There are a number of different ways orange juice industry leaders extract their oranges. Some common methods include halving the fruit and pressing/ reaming the orange to extract juice from the orange. One instrument inserts a tube through the orange peel and forces the juice out through the tube by squeezing the entire orange. Despite the variety of machines used to extract juices, all machines have commonalities in that they are rugged, fast, easy to clean, and have the ability to reduce peel extractives into the juice. The extracted juice product does not contain the orange peel, but it may contain pulp and seeds, which are removed by finishers. Finishers have a screw-type design that comprises of a conical helical screw enclosed in a cylindrical screen with perforations the size of 0.020 to 0.045 inches. Thereafter, the finished orange juice flows through blending tanks where the juice is tested for acid and soluble solids. At this stage sugar can be added to the juice depending on if the product will be a sweetened or unsweetened beverage. Following blending, the orange juice is deaerated where air is incorporated into the juice during extraction. The benefits of deaeration include the elimination of foaming, which improves the uniformity of can fill and improvement regarding the efficiency of the heat exchanger. Orange peel oil is essential for maximum flavor, but according to U.S. standards for Grades of Canned Orange Juice, 0.03% of recoverable oil is permitted. Deoiling through the use of vacuum distillation is the mechanism used to regulate the amount of peel oil in the juice. Condensation separates the oil and the aqueous distillate, which is returned to the juice. The next step is one of the most vital in the processing of orange juice. Pasteurization is important in destroying naturally occurring enzymes that are associated with deterioration of the juice. Pectinesterase is infamous for its deteriorative activity in orange juice. In the pasteurization process, juice is generally rapidly heated to 197 °F for about 40 seconds. Several industry leaders use flash pasteurization, which is carried out by tubular or plate-type heat exchangers. In order to prevent over heating, turbulent flow is vital to heat the juice rapidly. Cans are filled with the pasteurized juice and inverted immediately to allow the juice to sterilize the inside parts of the lid. The orange juice filled can is sealed and cooled to 90 to 100 °F by spinning on the conveyor belt under cool water sprays. Quality of storage is determined by time and temperature.

87_8	CAR_b378f5eaae56128f79a156d4c67ca60622c0072e	Single strength orange juice (SSOJ) can either be “not from concentrate” (NFC) orange juice or juice that is reconstituted from a concentrate with the addition of water to reach a specific single strength brix level. The processing of SSOJ also begins with the selection of orange. The most common types of orange used to produce orange juice are the Pineapple orange, Valencia orange, and Washington Navel oranges from Florida and California. The manufacturing journey begins when oranges are delivered to processing plants by trucks holding about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds of fruit. The fruit is unloaded at the plant for inspection and grading to remove unsuitable fruit before the oranges enter the storage bins. An automatic sampler contraption removes oranges for determination of acid and soluble solids. The bins are organized based on ratio of soluble solids to acids in order to blend oranges appropriate to produce juice with uniform flavor. After the fruit leaves the bins, they are scrubbed with detergent on a rotary brush washer and subsequently rinsed with potable water. Throughout the processing stages, there are multiple points with facilities that inspect oranges and discard damaged fruit. The oranges then go through roller conveyors, which expose all sides of the fruit. The roller conveyors are efficiently built as they are well lighted, installed at a convenient height, and width to ensure all inspectors can reach the fruit to determine inadequacies. Some reasons why fruit may be rejected include indication of mold, rot, and ruptured peels. Afterwards, the oranges are separated based on size through machines prior to juice extraction. There are a number of different ways orange juice industry leaders extract their oranges. Some common methods include halving the fruit and pressing/ reaming the orange to extract juice from the orange. One instrument inserts a tube through the orange peel and forces the juice out through the tube by squeezing the entire orange. Despite the variety of machines used to extract juices, all machines have commonalities in that they are rugged, fast, easy to clean, and have the ability to reduce peel extractives into the juice. The extracted juice product does not contain the orange peel, but it may contain pulp and seeds, which are removed by finishers. Finishers have a screw-type design that comprises of a conical helical screw enclosed in a cylindrical screen with perforations the size of 0.020 to 0.045 inches. Thereafter, the finished orange juice flows through blending tanks where the juice is tested for acid and soluble solids. At this stage sugar can be added to the juice depending on if the product will be a sweetened or unsweetened beverage. Following blending, the orange juice is deaerated where air is incorporated into the juice during extraction. The benefits of deaeration include the elimination of foaming, which improves the uniformity of can fill and improvement regarding the efficiency of the heat exchanger. Orange peel oil is essential for maximum flavor, but according to U.S. standards for Grades of Canned Orange Juice, 0.03% of recoverable oil is permitted. Deoiling through the use of vacuum distillation is the mechanism used to regulate the amount of peel oil in the juice. Condensation separates the oil and the aqueous distillate, which is returned to the juice. The next step is one of the most vital in the processing of orange juice. Pasteurization is important in destroying naturally occurring enzymes that are associated with deterioration of the juice. Pectinesterase is infamous for its deteriorative activity in orange juice. In the pasteurization process, juice is generally rapidly heated to 197 °F for about 40 seconds. Several industry leaders use flash pasteurization, which is carried out by tubular or plate-type heat exchangers. In order to prevent over heating, turbulent flow is vital to heat the juice rapidly. Cans are filled with the pasteurized juice and inverted immediately to allow the juice to sterilize the inside parts of the lid. The orange juice filled can is sealed and cooled to 90 to 100 °F by spinning on the conveyor belt under cool water sprays. Quality of storage is determined by time and temperature. Juice must be stored at cool temperatures to prevent deterioration.

Faced with the renewed Ottoman assault and a struggling economy, despite the prospect of considerable reinforcements from Western Europe, in 1668 the  Signoria  hoped to end the war by striking a peace settlement with the Ottomans. Indeed, the Venetians hoped to use the imminent arrival of reinforcements to secure concessions from the Ottomans. Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin. Molin and his embassy traveled to  Larissa , where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions. The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, emboldened by further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer. Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations and to continue observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic.

Two distinct crafts are evident in Ottoman urban culture that of the architect and that of the master builder (maistores in Macedonia and Epirus, kalfa in Anatolia and sometimesin Bulgaria) who shared the responsibilities and tasks for the design and construction of all sorts of building projects. During  Mimar Sinan 's period as a chief imperial architect until the second half of the 16th century between forty and seventy architects produced designs for a very large labour force, controlled the construction of military and civil facilities, water and road infrastructure from  Budapest  to  Cairo . The centralized has or hassa (sultan's property and service) system had allowed a small number of architects to control all significant imperial and most vakif building sites over the vast territories of the empire. In the 18th century the empire was opened to Western influence. By the late 18th century a growing number of Ottoman Christians were recruited. Until the very end of the Ottoman state the master builders maintained a cultural equilibrium between the Ottoman spirit and architectural innovation both in the Balkans and Anatolia. Turkish, Slavic, and Greek masters combining Western styles with Ottoman views extended the architectural landscape with one of the best examples being the  Filibe - Plovdiv  symmetrical house. Innovations were derived from the Ottoman house and market (çarşı) buildings in  Anatolia, Macedonia, and Bulgaria.

In early 1915, Enver ordered that all 200,000 Ottoman Armenian soldiers, now disarmed in the labour battalions be killed. The decision to enter the war and the decision to begin the genocide were part and parcel of the same progress as the war held out the promise of national greatness once the Allies were defeated while the Armenians were seen as an inner enemy holding the Turks back from the national glory that was the dream of the Unionist central committee. Furthermore, the war-time radicalising atmosphere of emergency and national crisis made it possible to pursue policies that would be seen as unacceptable in peace-time. Since Britain and France were the principal liberal states in Europe and the Armenians as a minority the principal advocates of liberalism within the Ottoman Empire, the government linked the external enemy with the alleged internal enemy as liberalism everywhere was portrayed as the enemy of the Ottoman state; since the German government portrayed the war in similar terms as an ideological battle between the forces of "German order" vs. Anglo-French liberalism and democracy, it is not surprising that the Unionists should choose Germany as their ally. Finally, the war was intended to lead to the Ottoman state becoming greater and more powerful than had ever been; in the world envisioned by the Unionist leaders, Ottoman society was to become exclusively Turkish and Muslim; there was no place for the Christian Armenians in this society. Further increasing the sense of crisis was the beginning of the Gallipoli campaign in March 1915, when British and French warships tried to force the Dardanelles, only to be prevented by sea mines in the Dardanelles and by the Ottoman howitzers on Gallipoli, which prevented minesweepers from clearing the minefields. Constantinople was not only the empire's capital, largest city and the economic heart of the empire, it was also the place where the weapons from Germany essential to sustaining the war arrived. If Constantinople fell, the empire was doomed. For many, the landings of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops on Gallipoli in April 1915 seemed to mark the harbinger of the empire's destruction and a sense of extreme national crisis emerged amongst the Ottoman population. Owing to the importance of Constantinople, the CUP regime made desperate efforts to win the  Battle of Gallipoli , which was a bloodbath right from the start with extremely heavy losses on both sides; one Ottoman officer called Gallipoli an "inferno" and "a ritual of fire and death". The Ottoman troops were told by their imām that as the war was jihad every man who "martyred" himself for Allah by being killed in the battle would be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven, which helps to explain why the Ottoman soldiers at Gallipoli fought with such indifference to death.

88_1	CAR_2ac271f79911394138c92760427281a9507d8458	In the Ottoman Empire, the Timar system was one in which the projected revenue of a conquered territory was distributed in the form of temporary land grants among the  Sipahis  (cavalrymen) and other members of the military class including  Janissaries  and other  kuls  (slaves) of the  sultan . These prebends were given as compensation for annual military service, for which they received no pay. In rare circumstances women could become Timar holders. This position however was restricted to women who were prominent within the imperial family, or high-ranking members of the Ottoman elite. Timars could be small, when they would be granted by governors, or large, which then required a certificate from the  Sultan , but generally the fief had an annual value of less than twenty thousand akces (an Ottoman silver coin). This system of land tenure lasted roughly from the fourteenth century through to the sixteenth century. The goals of the system were necessitated by financial, state and expansionist purposes. The financial aims of the system were to relieve pressure from the Ottoman state of paying the army as well as to gain a new source of revenue for the central treasury. The expansionist aims were to increase the number of cavalry soldiers and to gradually assimilate and bring conquered countries under direct Ottoman control. The Ottoman state also desired to centralize the sultan’s authority by removing the feudal system and aristocratic elements from dominating the empire.

An important aspect of this was the state's (i.e. the sultan's) absolute ownership of all land, and "this lack of private ownership reinforced the core of the patrimonial system: the ruler's ability to maintain and secure his position"; however, it is important to note the complexity of the reality of land ownership during the entirety of Ottoman rule. This complexity is the reason why historian Attila Aytekin calls absolute land ownership in the empire a "legal fiction." The reality was defined by a tension between provincial agents and state control. The state's main concerns about the çift-hane system for much of the Ottoman reign were maintaining the integrity of family farms, keeping peasants on the land, and ensuring the protection of subsistence crops.

In the Ottoman Empire, the  Devşrime system  groomed young slave boys for civil or military service.Young Christian boys were uprooted from their conquered villages periodically as a levy, and were employed in government, entertainment, or the army, depending on their talents.Slaves attained great success from this program, some winning the post of Grand Vizier to the Sultan and others positions in the  Janissaries .
88_1	CAR_4c3d06704732280aae6957cd9eaa4198bd599905	Slavery  was a part of Ottoman society, with most slaves employed as domestic servants. Agricultural slavery, such as that which was widespread in the Americas, was relatively rare. Unlike systems of  chattel slavery , slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, but maintained basic, though limited, rights. This gave them a degree of protection against abuse. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908. During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice. Policies developed by various Sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the  slave trade  but, since slavery did have centuries of religious backing and sanction, they never directly abolished the institution outright.
88_1	CAR_4dd3b2618fed79489d524e682ec9080d171c7b32	Due to the nature of the documentation of the early history of the Ottomans it is very difficult to assign the Timar system a concrete date. Elements of the Timar system however can be seen to have their origins in Pre-Islamic antiquity (Ancient Middle Eastern Empires,  Rome ,  Byzantium , and Pre-Islamic  Iran ).  Pronoia  of the late Byzantine era is perhaps the immediate predecessor of the Timar system. However, it was not until the re-emergence of the empire under  Mehmed I  in 1413 that a tenure system that was distinctly Timar was developed. Before the collapse of the empire by  Timur  in 1402,  Bayezid  had granted quasi- Timar holdings to his own slaves. With the reunification of the Ottoman lands under a  Sultan , these men would once again have legal title to their holdings. Over the next fifty years this system of land tenure was largely expanded and standardized. After the conquest of  Constantinople  in 1453, the Ottoman turned once more to the familiar policy of expansion through conquest. With the period of consolidation that followed there was a move towards total annexation and assimilation of the provinces into the Ottoman system. This meant the elimination of local dynasties and replacing them with the Timar system and other apparatuses of provincial administration.

Full conscription was applied in İstanbul for the first time during World War I, and a lasting phraseology describes the  Dardanelles Campaign  as Turkey having "buried a university in  Çanakkale ". Non-Muslim Millets (minorities for some sources) were also issued a general call to serve in the military for the first time during World War I in the history of the Empire; but they did not participate in action and served behind the lines. At the end of the war, many families were left with the elderly, children and young widows, see  the figure widowhood in Anatolia . Given that the Ottoman Empire was engaged in nearly eight years of continuous warfare (1911-1918  Italo-Turkish War ,  Balkan Wars , World War I) social disintegration was inevitable.

These land grants were given as compensation for annual military service, for which they received no pay.  Timars could be small, granted by governors, or large which required a certificate from the  Sultan  but generally the  fief  had an annual value of less than twenty thousand  akçe s.  Although the military officers were granted land they did not have title which was retained by the Sultan.  If the military member died or left the land it reverted to the Sultan to be distributed to a new person.  Under this system the temporary owners could demand about three days labour per year from the peasants living on their land.  This is compared to two or three days a week under the Christian feudal system.

The global markets for Ottoman goods fell somewhat with certain sectors expanding. However, any changes were compensated by an increase in domestic consumption and demand. Mechanized production even at its peak remained an insignificant portion of total output. The lack of capital, as in other areas of the economy, deterred the mechanization of production. Nonetheless, a number of factories did emerge in Istanbul, Ottoman Europe and Anatolia. In the 1830s steam powered silk reeling factories emerged in  Salonica ,  Edirne , West Anatolia and  Lebanon .

88_1	CAR_adfd26ff4b184f5f9bf4b26af6e7de2d6943fde1	The Ottoman bureaucracy (mālīye) expanded dramatically both with regard to size and range of activity. While only 38 salaried scribes were serving in 1549, by 1593 this number had increased to 183. As the  Timar System  was phased out of use, tax revenues which had once been distributed locally to the empire's army of  feudal cavalry  were now remitted to Istanbul, either through direct collection (emānet) or through  tax farming  (iltizām). A larger bureaucracy was thus needed in order to cope with the empire's increasingly centralized fiscal system. Bureaucratic organization was diversified, with new branches being formed and scribal duties increasingly specialized. The high quality of the Ottoman bureaucracy was underpinned by stringent standards of scribal recruitment. By the early seventeenth century the bureaucracy was moved out of its original location in  Topkapı Palace , indicating that it was becoming independent of the sultan's household. It thus became a stabilizing influence for the empire; while sultans and viziers rose and fell, the bureaucracy remained in place, providing cohesion and continuity to imperial administration.

In  Constantinople  (present-day  Istanbul ), the administrative and political center of the Empire, about a fifth of the population consisted of slaves in 1609. Even after several measures to ban slavery in the late 19th century, the practice continued largely unfazed into the early 20th century. As late as 1908, female slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire.  Sexual slavery  was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution.

To staff its bureaucracy, the Ottoman Empire established a  janissary system  which seized hundreds of thousands of Christian boys through the  devşirme  system. They were well cared for but were legally slaves owned by the government and were not allowed to marry. They were never bought or sold. The Empire gave them significant administrative and military roles. The system began about 1365; there were 135,000 janissaries in 1826, when the system ended. After the  Battle of Lepanto , 12,000 Christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the  Ottoman fleet .

The early reforms were generally addressed at changing the organisation of, and systems within, the Ottoman Empire as a whole. However, as a result of diplomatic pressures exerted by the  Great Powers  that had supported the Ottoman Empire against Russia during the  Crimean War , in 1856 reforms were made that sought to give non-Muslims citizens of the Ottoman Empire the same rights as Muslim citizens.

In Albania and Montenegro, for example, local leaders paid nominal tribute to the Empire and otherwise had little contact. The  Republic of Ragusa  paid an annual tribute but otherwise was free to pursue its rivalry with the  Republic of Venice . The two Romance-speaking principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia had their own nobility, but were ruled by Greek families chosen by the Sultan. In Greece, the elite comprised clergymen and scholars, but there was scarcely any Greek aristocracy. A million or more Turks had settled in the Balkans, typically in smaller urban centers where they were garrison troops, civil servants, and craftsmen and merchants. There were also important communities of Jewish and Greek merchants. The Turks and Jews were not to be found in the countryside, so there was a very sharp social differentiation between the cities and their surrounding region in terms of language, religion and ethnicity. The Ottoman Empire collected taxes at about the 10% rate but there was no forced labor and the workers and peasants were not especially oppressed by the Empire.  The Sultan favoured and protected the Orthodox clergy, primarily as a protection against the missionary zeal of Roman Catholics.

88_1	CAR_ef42c546fcee11db348270471bb9604b45dd721b	The çift-hane system was the basic unit of agrarian land holding and taxation in the  Ottoman Empire  from its beginning. The pre-modern Ottoman system of land tenure was based on the distribution of land between publicly owned lands, miri and privately owned lands mülk, and the majority of the arable land was miri, especially grain-producing land. Peasants were the vast majority of the empire, and they worked as farmers on land designated as miri, relying heavily on wheat-barley production for their subsistence. The peasant household had been the basic form of agrarian production in much of the land ruled by the Ottomans since Roman times, and this had continued through Byzantine rule. So, the çift-hane system was based on the realities which were present in much of the lands the Ottomans conquered: a class of free peasants cultivating their own land, and a taxation policy combining  Byzantine , Ottoman, and Islamic rules.

The Ottoman state maintained the system by declaring dry-farming regions to be state owned and by protecting the integrity of the peasant household. The Ottoman state wanted all lands in the form of çiftlik in order to prevent the land's integration into landed properties and partition into smaller units. For this same reason, the central state often reassigned provincial governors to prevent them from acquiring loyalties. The system of timar-holding upheld this state centralism because the labor of the peasants helped maintain the military exploits of the empire—providing not only revenue but labor in the form of land cultivation and collection of firewood and straw for military families. However, the peasants resented these direct forms of servitude towards land holders, which is why the central state sought to maintain or even convert land to the çiftlik form of taxation. A main concern of the state was to keep peasants on the land, which was why peasants were not allowed to relocate. Land holders were incentivized to keep peasants on the land because peasant work was their main source of revenue.

Slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, and the army. Some rulers even relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that they seized power. In some cases, the treatment of slaves was so harsh that it led to uprisings, such as the  Zanj Rebellion . However, this was an exception rather than the norm, as the vast  majority of labor  in the medieval  Islamic world  consisted of free,  paid labour . For a variety of reasons, internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands. In theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice.

The majority of officials in the Ottoman government were bought slaves, raised free, and integral to the success of the Ottoman Empire from the 14th century into the 19th. Many officials themselves owned a large number of slaves, although the  Sultan  himself owned by far the largest amount.

Several decades prior to discovery of the  New World , in response to serious military threat to Europe posed by Muslims of the  Ottoman Empire ,  Pope Nicholas V  had granted Portugal the right to subdue Muslims, pagans and other unbelievers in the papal bull  Dum Diversas  (1452). Six years after African slavery was first outlawed by the first major entity to do so, (Great Britain in 1833),  Pope Gregory XVI  followed in a challenge to Spanish and Portuguese policy, by condemning slavery and the slave trade in the 1839 papal bull  In supremo apostolatus , and approved the ordination of native clergy in the face of government racism.

A fair proportion of male slaves were imported as eunuchs. Slave markets made more money by using 9-10 year old African boys to create eunuchs and slave traders created eunuch surgery stations that had unsanitary conditions. The  Ottoman court harem —within the  Topkapı Palace  (1465–1853) and later the  Dolmabahçe Palace  (1853–1909) in  Istanbul —was under the administration of the eunuchs. These were of two categories: Black Eunuchs and White Eunuchs. Black Eunuchs were African slaves who served the concubines and officials in the Harem together with chamber maidens of low rank. The White Eunuchs were Europeans from the  Balkans  or the  Caucasus , either purchased in the slave markets or were boys taken from Christian families in the Balkans who were unable to pay the  Jizya  tax. They served the recruits at the  Palace School  and were from 1582 prohibited from entering the Harem. An important figure in the Ottoman court was the  Chief Black Eunuch  (Kızlar Ağası or Dar al-Saada Ağası). In control of both the Harem and a net of spies in the Black Eunuchs, the Chief Eunuch was involved in almost every palace intrigue and could thereby gain power over either the sultan or one of his viziers, ministers, or other court officials. One of the most powerful Chief Eunuchs was  Beshir Agha  in the 1730s, who played a crucial role in establishing the Ottoman version of  Hanafi  Islam throughout the Empire by founding libraries and schools. The entire  Devşirme  system, where the children of Christian families in the Balkans unable to pay the onerous jizya tax were taken away, and, depending upon their sex, became either concubines, in the case of the girls, or, in the case of the boys, were conscripted into Janissary Corps or became eunuchs. The act (emasculation) made Ottoman rule much hated by Christians in the Balkans.

Ottoman garrisons were dispatched to Tsutskvati, Poti and Shorapani fortresses. 12,000 slaves were sold in the Ottoman Empire every year from  Mengrelia  alone. Realizing that Georgia was facing the threat of heavy depopulation, the King of Imereti, Solomon I prohibited slavery, opposing turncoat Lords and wanted independence from the Ottoman Empire.

This institution played an important social function within the  Ottoman court , and demonstrated considerable political authority in Ottoman affairs, especially during the long period known as the  Sultanate of Women . The utmost authority in the Imperial Harem was the  Valide Sultan , who ruled over the other women in the household and was often of  slave origin  herself. The  Kizlar Agha  (Kızlarağası, also known as the "Chief Black Eunuch" because of the  black African  origin of most aghas) was the head of the eunuchs responsible for guarding the Imperial Harem.

The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in Africa and  Circassia  in the Caucasus. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations.  Enslavement of  Caucasians  was banned in the early 19th century, while slaves from other groups were allowed. In  Constantinople  (present-day  Istanbul ), the administrative and political center of the Empire, about a fifth of the population consisted of slaves in 1609.

Portugal was the first country in the continent to abolish slavery in metropolitan Portugal and  Portuguese India  by a bill issued on the 12 February 1761, but this did not affect their colonies of  Brazil  and Africa. France abolished slavery in 1794. However, slavery was again allowed by  Napoleon  in 1802 and not abolished for good until 1848. In 1803,  Denmark-Norway  became the first country from Europe to implement a ban on the slave trade. Slavery itself was not banned until 1848. Britain followed in 1807 with the passage of the  Abolition of the Slave Trade Act  by Parliament. This law allowed stiff fines, increasing with the number of slaves transported, for captains of slave ships. Britain followed this with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833  which freed all slaves in the British Empire. British pressure on other countries resulted in them agreeing to end the slave trade from Africa. For example, the  1820 U.S. Law on Slave Trade  made slave trading  piracy , punishable by  death . In addition, the  Ottoman Empire  abolished slave trade from Africa in 1847 under British pressure.

Qutb's brother and promoter,  Muhammad Qutb , vigorously defended Islamic slavery, telling his audience that "Islam gave spiritual enfranchisement to slaves" and "in the early period of Islam the slave was exalted to such a noble state of humanity as was never before witnessed in any other part of the world." He contrasted the adultery, prostitution, and (what he called) "that most odious form of animalism" casual sex that are found in Europe, with (what he called) "that clean and spiritual bond that ties a maid [i.e. slave girl] to her master in Islam."

Dhimmi  boys taken in the devşirme could also become sexual slaves, though usually they worked in places like bathhouses ( hammam ) and coffeehouses. They became  tellak s (masseurs),  köçek s (cross-dressing dancers) or sāqīs (wine pourers) for as long as they were young and beardless.

During his reign he had realized while both looking to his own empire and that of the neighboring Ottomans, that there were dangerous rivalling factions and internal family rivalries that were a threat to the heads of state. Not taken care of accordingly, these were a serious threat to the ruler, or worse, could bring the fall of the former or could lead to unnecessary court intrigues. According to  Encyclopedia Iranica , for Tahmāsp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the  Qezelbāš , who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement. Despite that Tahmāsp could nullify and neglect some of his consternations regarding potential issues related to his family by having his close direct male relatives such as his brothers and sons routinely transferred around to various governorships in the empire, he understood and realized that any long-term solutions would mainly involve minimizing the political and military presence of the Qezelbāš as a whole. According to Encyclopedia Iranica, his father and founder of the Empire, Ismail I, had begun this process on a bureaucratic level as he appointed a number of prominent Persians in powerful bureaucratic positions, and one can see this continued in Tahmāsp’s lengthy and close relationship with the  chief vizier , Qāżi Jahān of Qazvin, after 1535. While Persians continued to fill their historical role as administrators and clerical elites under Tahmāsp, little had been done so far to minimize the military role of the Qezelbāš. Therefore, in 1540, Shah Tahmāsp started the first of a series of invasions of the  Caucasus  region, both meant as a training and drilling for his soldiers, as well as mainly bringing back massive numbers of  Christian   Circassian  and  Georgian  slaves, who would form the basis of a military slave system, alike to the  janissaries  of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire, as well as at the same time forming a new layer in Iranian society composed of ethnic  Caucasians .At the fourth invasion in 1553, it was now clear that Tahmāsp followed a policy of annexation and resettlement as he gained control over  Tbilisi  (Tiflis) and the region of  Kartli  while physically transplanting more than 30,000 people to the central Iranian heartlands. According to Encyclopedia Iranica, this would be the starting point for the corps of the ḡolāmān-e ḵāṣṣa-ye-e šarifa, or royal slaves, who would dominate the Safavid military for most of the empire's length. As non-Turcoman converts to Islam, these Circassian and Georgian  ḡolāmāns  (also written as ghulams) were completely unrestrained by clan loyalties and kinship obligations, which was an attractive feature for a ruler like Tahmāsp whose childhood and upbringing had been deeply affected by Qezelbāš tribal politics. In turn, many of these transplanted women became wives and concubines of Tahmāsp, and the Safavid harem emerged as a competitive, and sometimes lethal, arena of ethnic politics as cliques of Turkmen, Circassian, and Georgian women and courtiers vied with each other for the shah’s attention.

In the Ottoman Empire, the  Devşrime system  groomed young slave boys for civil or military service.Young Christian boys were uprooted from their conquered villages periodically as a levy, and were employed in government, entertainment, or the army, depending on their talents.Slaves attained great success from this program, some winning the post of Grand Vizier to the Sultan and others positions in the  Janissaries .
88_2	CAR_4c3d06704732280aae6957cd9eaa4198bd599905	Slavery  was a part of Ottoman society, with most slaves employed as domestic servants. Agricultural slavery, such as that which was widespread in the Americas, was relatively rare. Unlike systems of  chattel slavery , slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, but maintained basic, though limited, rights. This gave them a degree of protection against abuse. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908. During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice. Policies developed by various Sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the  slave trade  but, since slavery did have centuries of religious backing and sanction, they never directly abolished the institution outright.
88_2	CAR_4dd3b2618fed79489d524e682ec9080d171c7b32	Due to the nature of the documentation of the early history of the Ottomans it is very difficult to assign the Timar system a concrete date. Elements of the Timar system however can be seen to have their origins in Pre-Islamic antiquity (Ancient Middle Eastern Empires,  Rome ,  Byzantium , and Pre-Islamic  Iran ).  Pronoia  of the late Byzantine era is perhaps the immediate predecessor of the Timar system. However, it was not until the re-emergence of the empire under  Mehmed I  in 1413 that a tenure system that was distinctly Timar was developed. Before the collapse of the empire by  Timur  in 1402,  Bayezid  had granted quasi- Timar holdings to his own slaves. With the reunification of the Ottoman lands under a  Sultan , these men would once again have legal title to their holdings. Over the next fifty years this system of land tenure was largely expanded and standardized. After the conquest of  Constantinople  in 1453, the Ottoman turned once more to the familiar policy of expansion through conquest. With the period of consolidation that followed there was a move towards total annexation and assimilation of the provinces into the Ottoman system. This meant the elimination of local dynasties and replacing them with the Timar system and other apparatuses of provincial administration.

One of the first religious decrees comes from the two highest dignitaries of the Hanafi and Maliki rites in the Ottoman Empire. These religious authorities declared that slavery is lawful in principle but it is regrettable in its consequences. They expressed two religious considerations in their support for abolition of slavery: "the initial enslaving of the people concerned comes under suspicion of illegality by reason of the present-day expansion of Islam in their countries; masters no longer comply with the rules of good treatment which regulate their rights and shelter them from wrong-doing."

Women were put into a subservient category because of their "putative physical and moral weaknesses", which "rendered them subject to men" (Zilfi 16). This was mostly because of "decontextualized scriptural snippets" from the Quran, which "played an important role in authorizing women's social marginalization" (Zilfi 16).  Islamic law  is primarily based on the Quran. Because of the way it is written, there is "a general acceptance of women and girls as sexual commodities" and that female slaves could be freed and married by their masters (Sexual Ethics and Islam… 40). In addition, this interpretation of the  Quran  was often thought of as a major factor in shaping Muslim thinking on sex and marriage.

He explored the gap between military-administrative elite slavery, domestic slaves in households, and agricultural enserfment-enslavement. His later work attempted to recover voices of enslaved persons, look at the enslaver-enslaved relationship as a coerced attachment, and examine what happened when trust was violated by the enslavers; it also looked at agency and resistance by the enslaved.  More recently he has explored the reasons for the fact that Muslim-majority societies generated limited antislavery argumentation and had weak abolitionist movements, if at all.

Due to the common occurrence of such intermarriages in the Ottoman Empire, they have had a significant impact on the ethnic makeup of the modern  Turkish  population in  Turkey , which now differs from that of the  Turkic  population in Central Asia. In addition to intermarriage, the large harems of Ottoman sultans often consisted almost entirely of female  concubines  who were of Christian European origin. Sultan  Ibrahim the Mad , Ottoman ruler from 1640 to 1648, is said to have drowned 280 concubines of his harem in the Bosphorus. At least one of his concubines,  Turhan Hatice , Ukrainian girl captured during one of the  raids by Tatars  and sold into  slavery , survived his reign.

Though the "position of the domestic slave in Muslim society was in most respects better than in either  classical antiquity  or the nineteenth-century Americas", thanks to regulation by Sharia law, the enlightened incentives and opportunities for slaves to be emancipated meant there was a strong market for new slaves and thus strong incentive to enslave and sell human beings. Appalling loss of life and hardships often resulted from the processes of acquisition and transportation of slaves to Muslim lands and this drew the attention of European opponents of slavery. The continuing pressure from European countries eventually overcame the strong resistance of religious conservatives who were holding that forbidding what God permits is just as great an offence as to permit what God forbids. Slavery, in their eyes, was "authorized and regulated by the holy law". Even masters persuaded of their own piety and benevolence sexually exploited their concubines, without a thought of whether this constituted a violation of their humanity. There were also many pious Muslims who refused to have slaves and persuaded others to do so. Eventually, the Ottoman Empire's orders against the traffic of slaves were issued and put into effect.

Harem  guards and  janissaries  are some of the better known positions a slave could hold, but slaves were actually often at the forefront of Ottoman politics. The majority of officials in the Ottoman government were bought slaves, raised free, and integral to the success of the Ottoman Empire from the 14th century into the 19th. Many officials themselves owned a large number of slaves, although the  Sultan  himself owned by far the largest amount.

These dual processes created Ottoman-Local elites that centered around the household, the basic unit of networking throughout the region. Political, social, economic, and cultural goods were moving through those networks, which tied the provinces to the imperial center and transformed the modes by which the Ottoman Empire was being governed in that period. During the first quarter of the eighteenth century, a hegemonic household emerged in each of the major provinces, bringing to the fore the House of Mehmet Ali in Egypt, the Azms in Syria, the Husaynis in Tunisia, and the Eyyübizades in Baghdad, among others. Later, some of these households would serve as the precursors of the monarchies that ruled the new nation-states of the Middle East and North Africa until the rise of military regimes in the second half of the twentieth century. This historical trajectory, based on internal processes rather than solely on external, European impact, Toledano argues, offers a plausible alternative to the now-defunct Decline Paradigm in Ottoman history.

In 1805, the Ottoman Sultan  Selim III  reluctantly recognized him as  Wāli  under Ottoman suzerainty. Muhammad Ali, however, styled himself as  Khedive , and though technically a  vassal  of the Ottoman Empire, governed Egypt as if it were an independent state. Seeking to rival and ultimately supplant the Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad Ali implemented a rapid modernization and militarization program, and expanded Egypt's borders south into  Sudan  and north into  Syria . Eventually he waged war on the Ottoman Empire with the intention of overthrowing the ruling  Osman Dynasty  and replacing it with his own. Though the intervention of the  Great Powers  prevented Muhammad Ali from realizing his grandiose ambitions of becoming sultan himself, obliging Egypt to remain technically part of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt's autonomy survived his death with the  Porte  recognizing the  Muhammad Ali Dynasty  as hereditary rulers of the country.

His family had ruled since 1299 in an unbroken lineage throughout the empire's history. The Ottoman dynasty (as  Sultan ) maintained supreme authority over the Ottoman Empire's polity. The sultan was the empire's sole and absolute regent, head of state and head of government. The  Grand Vizier s and polity established by the  Ottoman Constitution  functioned at the pleasure of the Sultan.

Dervish Cara requested that Albanians be exempt from the law of the Ottoman army, under which all Muslims were forced to serve in the regular army ( Nizam ); stop the replacement of Ottoman local government officials (who were Albanians or spoke Albanian) with Turkish officials brought from  Anatolia , who knew neither the language and customs; and the recognition of Albanian autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, as was recognized the autonomy of Serbia in 1830. The Sublime Porte did not accept the terms and countered with their own. They offered that amnesty would be given to the rebels as well as abolishment of the new taxes and the postponement of the recruitment process which would become voluntary in the future. However, the rebels must hand over their armaments to the Ottoman commander in chief Omer Pasha and no Albanian autonomy with in the empire. Cara refused the offer and fighting resumed.

At its height, the Ottoman Empire spanned from  Hungary  in the north to  Yemen  in the south, and from  Algeria  in the west to  Iraq  in the east. Administered at first from the city of  Bursa , the empire's capital was moved to  Edirne  in 1363 following its  conquest  by  Murad I , and then to  Constantinople  (present-day  Istanbul ) in 1453 following its  conquest  by  Mehmed II .
88_3	CAR_251ee5327c2bb3d671e42a703715837b9cb7fa9f	The Ottoman legal system accepted the  religious law  over its subjects. At the same time the  Qanun  (or Kanun), a secular legal system, co-existed with religious law or  Sharia . The Ottoman Empire was always organized around a system of local  jurisprudence . Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority. Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local  millet . The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups. The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the "trade court". The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative Qanun, i.e. laws, a system based upon the Turkic  Yassa  and  Töre , which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.

This institution played an important social function within the  Ottoman court , and demonstrated considerable political authority in Ottoman affairs, especially during the long period known as the  Sultanate of Women . The utmost authority in the Imperial Harem was the  Valide Sultan , who ruled over the other women in the household and was often of  slave origin  herself. The  Kizlar Agha  (Kızlarağası, also known as the "Chief Black Eunuch" because of the  black African  origin of most aghas) was the head of the eunuchs responsible for guarding the Imperial Harem.

The governors of local provinces were appointed by the state and played a similar role to the sultan as the supposed overseers of all individuals living under their command; local armies in each region were under the command of the governor and were supposed to protect the peasantry; tax collectors were intended to collect revenue; and the peasantry was expected to cultivate the local lands in order to produce agricultural revenue. Highlighting the role of religion as the essential basis for this entire system was the role of the local  mufti , who was authorized by the state to make decisions on legal cases based upon his understanding of Islamic law.
88_3	CAR_2ac271f79911394138c92760427281a9507d8458	In the Ottoman Empire, the Timar system was one in which the projected revenue of a conquered territory was distributed in the form of temporary land grants among the  Sipahis  (cavalrymen) and other members of the military class including  Janissaries  and other  kuls  (slaves) of the  sultan . These prebends were given as compensation for annual military service, for which they received no pay. In rare circumstances women could become Timar holders. This position however was restricted to women who were prominent within the imperial family, or high-ranking members of the Ottoman elite. Timars could be small, when they would be granted by governors, or large, which then required a certificate from the  Sultan , but generally the fief had an annual value of less than twenty thousand akces (an Ottoman silver coin). This system of land tenure lasted roughly from the fourteenth century through to the sixteenth century. The goals of the system were necessitated by financial, state and expansionist purposes. The financial aims of the system were to relieve pressure from the Ottoman state of paying the army as well as to gain a new source of revenue for the central treasury. The expansionist aims were to increase the number of cavalry soldiers and to gradually assimilate and bring conquered countries under direct Ottoman control. The Ottoman state also desired to centralize the sultan’s authority by removing the feudal system and aristocratic elements from dominating the empire.

The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in Africa and  Circassia  in the Caucasus. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations.  Enslavement of  Caucasians  was banned in the early 19th century, while slaves from other groups were allowed. In  Constantinople  (present-day  Istanbul ), the administrative and political center of the Empire, about a fifth of the population consisted of slaves in 1609. 
88_3	CAR_2c113ad10be867aa6d82911664f1e0cb62a59e81	Before the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the  state organisation of the Ottoman Empire  was a system that had two main dimensions, which were the military administration and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The Ottomans practiced a system in which the state (as in the Byzantine Empire) had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic  Iran  remained important in Ottoman administrative circles. According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders within the overarching context of  orthodox  Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.
88_3	CAR_2c19dd9aff94bb1cafae48789df2e79b4616e6f2	Following the  Turkish conquest of Constantinople  in 1453, the Ottoman Sultan  Mehmed II  established the  Millet System , according to which the different ethnic groups within Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire were to be governed by a group of institutions based on faith. For this purpose, Mehmed II also founded previously non-existent religious authorities such as the  Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople  in 1461. Earlier, the Byzantines considered the Armenian Church as  heretic  and did not allow the Armenians to have churches inside the  walls of Constantinople . Several Armenian saints, such as  Saint Narses , were exiled and imprisoned in the  Princes' Islands  near Constantinople, in the  Sea of Marmara . With the Millet System, a great deal of the internal affairs regarding these communities were assigned to the administration of these religious authorities; such as the  Ecumenical Patriarchate  for the affairs of all Orthodox Christians, the Armenian Patriarchate for the affairs of the Armenian (and for some time also the Syriac) Christians, and later the Chief Rabbi for the affairs of the Jews.
88_3	CAR_2caebb513a4c7f738ad7eb5f85375c510590c9de	Devşirme  (blood tax) was one of the organized practices by which the Ottomans took boys from their Christian families, who were later converted to Islam with the aim of selecting and training the ablest of them for leading positions in the Ottoman society. As a rule , the  Ottomans  did not require the Greeks to become  Muslim s, although a minority did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule, take advantage of greater employment prospects and possibilities of advancement in the Ottoman government bureaucracy and military. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the  millet system , which was closely linked to  Islam ic religious rules. At that time people were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their  confessional communities ), rather than to their ethnic origins. Muslim communities prospered under the Ottoman Empire, and the Ottoman law did not recognize such notions as  ethnicity  and the Muslims of any ethnic background enjoyed precisely the same rights and privileges. Another major reason for converting to Islam was the well-organized taxation system based on religion. Major taxes were the  Defter  and  İspençe  and the more severe  haraç  whereby a document was issued which stated that "the holder of this certificate is able to keep his head on the shoulders since he paid the Χαράτσι tax for this year ...". All these of course were waived if the person would convert and become Muslim,. During the  Greek War of Independence , Ottoman Egyptian troops under the leadership of  Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt  ravaged the island of Crete and the Greek countryside of the  Morea  where the Muslim Egyptian soldiers enslaved vast numbers of Christian Greek children and women. Ibrahim arranged for the enslaved Greek children to be forcefully converted to Islam en masse. The enslaved Greeks were subsequently transferred to  Egypt  where they were sold as slaves. Several decades later in 1843, the English traveler and writer  Sir John Gardner Wilkinson  described the state of enslaved Greeks who had converted to Islam in Egypt:
88_3	CAR_2cbaf1d1cc7e2777189dd77bf906e2ee24de3935	The Ottoman Empire was governed through a top-down hierarchy with all authority ultimately residing with the sultan. As the empire began aggressively acquiring vast territories with diverse populations, the imperial authority adopted the timar system to rule over these lands and foster a steady source of tax revenue. Choosing from members of the  ulema  (religious and legal scholars), the berats of the sultan appointed a kadi to a district. Within each district, a bey from the military class carried out the sultan’s executive authority while the kadi represented his legal authority. The division of power between these two authorities produced a delicate balance; the bey needed a kadi’s judgement to punish a subject, and the kadi could not carry out his own rulings. According to Amy Singer, “It was to them that peasants brought their complaints of abusive behavior suffered at the hands of the  sipahi s and others.” Although the kadi also often abused their authority, the division of power allowed the tax paying class to have their grievances addressed without involving the far-away imperial authority. The power vested in the kadi allowed them to protect the legitimacy of the timar system while also securing the empire’s tax base.

Islamic culture did not separate religious and secular matters. At first, the Sultan was the highest power in the land and had control over almost everything. However, a state organization began to take a more definite shape in the first half of the sixteenth century under  Suleyman I , also known as "Lawgiver." The  Ottomans  visualized two separate "establishments" to share state power, one responsible for governing a nation's citizens and the other its military. "The Ottomans left civic control to the civic institutions. Historians often label the Ottoman sociopolitical construct the " Ottoman System . Noteworthy, however, the term " Ottoman System " conveys a sense of structural rigidity that probably was nonexistent throughout the Ottoman period.

This was due to the fact that the Russian army contained a contingent of  Armenian volunteers . On 24 April 1915,  Armenian intellectuals were arrested by Ottoman authorities  and, with the  Tehcir Law  (29 May 1915), eventually a large proportion of Armenians living in  Western Armenia  perished in what has become known as the  Armenian Genocide . There was local  Armenian resistance  in the region, developed against the activities of the Ottoman Empire. The events of 1915 to 1917 are regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians and even some Turkish writers and historians like  Taner Akçam  and  Orhan Pamuk  to have been state-sponsored and planned mass killings, or genocide.

In 1895, demands of reform among the Armenian subjects of the  Ottoman Empire  lead to  Sultan Abdul Hamid 's decision to suppress them resulting in the  Hamidian massacres  in which up to 300,000 Armenians were killed. In 1909, a massacre of Armenians in the city of  Adana  resulted in a series of anti-Armenian  pogrom s throughout the district resulting in the deaths of 20,000–30,000 Armenians. During  World War I , the Ottoman government massacred between 1 and 1.5 million Armenians in the  Armenian Genocide .  The position of the current Turkish government, however, is that the Armenians who died were casualties of the expected hardships of war, the casualties cited are exaggerated, and that the 1915 events could not be considered a genocide. This position has been criticized by international genocide scholars, and by 28 governments, which have resolutions  affirming  the genocide.

An important aspect of this was the state's (i.e. the sultan's) absolute ownership of all land, and "this lack of private ownership reinforced the core of the patrimonial system: the ruler's ability to maintain and secure his position"; however, it is important to note the complexity of the reality of land ownership during the entirety of Ottoman rule. This complexity is the reason why historian Attila Aytekin calls absolute land ownership in the empire a "legal fiction." The reality was defined by a tension between provincial agents and state control. The state's main concerns about the çift-hane system for much of the Ottoman reign were maintaining the integrity of family farms, keeping peasants on the land, and ensuring the protection of subsistence crops.

In 1915, the German ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Baron  Hans von Wangenheim  told the American ambassador to the Sublime Porte,  Henry Morgenthau, Sr.  : "I do not blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians...They are entirely justified". On September 28, 1915 Count  Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff , the ambassador in Washington, D.C. stated to American journalists that reports of a systematic campaign of extermination against the Armenian minority in the Ottoman empire were all "pure inventions", that these reports were all the work of British propaganda and no such campaign of extermination was doing place. However, Wangenheim's successor as ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Count  Paul Wolff Metternich  was appalled by the Armenian genocide, and unlike Wangenheim, who did not really care about the Armenians, Metternich was prepared to speak out against the genocide. In August 1916, the triumvirate known as the  Three Pashas  which ruled the Ottoman empire informed the German government that if Count Metternich was not recalled, he would be declared persona non grata. Metternich was promptly recalled from Constantinople rather risk a public relations disaster which potentially could damage German-Ottoman relations during the middle of the war. As the Ottoman empire today would be considered a third world country with no almost modern industry, the Ottoman government was entirely dependent upon weapons from Germany to fight World War I, giving the Reich a powerful form of leverage to apply against the Ottomans on behalf of the Armenians if only the political will in Berlin had been present. In a 2015 speech, the German president  Joachim Gauck  apologized for his country's inaction, stating that those diplomats who protested against the Armenian genocide were "ignored" by the leadership of Auswärtiges Amt, who valued good relations with the Ottoman empire more than they did the lives of the Armenians.

Agricultural slavery, such as that which was widespread in the Americas, was relatively rare. Unlike systems of  chattel slavery , slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, but maintained basic, though limited, rights. This gave them a degree of protection against abuse. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908. During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice. Policies developed by various Sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the  slave trade  but, since slavery did have centuries of religious backing and sanction, they never directly abolished the institution outright.

One of the first religious decrees comes from the two highest dignitaries of the Hanafi and Maliki rites in the Ottoman Empire. These religious authorities declared that slavery is lawful in principle but it is regrettable in its consequences. They expressed two religious considerations in their support for abolition of slavery: "the initial enslaving of the people concerned comes under suspicion of illegality by reason of the present-day expansion of Islam in their countries; masters no longer comply with the rules of good treatment which regulate their rights and shelter them from wrong-doing."

However, the Armenians had neither a police force nor an army. Heather Rae noted that scholars have long been denied access to Ottoman archives, which Turkish sources often refer to in their works. In the late 1980s access was granted to some archives by the Turkish government, but it appears that the material was limited and the government took a very selective approach to who was allowed to study the material. Historian  Taner Akcam  also writes about the "careful selection" of Ottoman archive materials. "While we are missing a significant portion of these papers, what remains in the Ottoman archives and in court records is sufficient to show that the  CUP  Central Committee, and the  Special Organization  is set up to carry out its plan, did deliberately attempt to destroy the Armenian population".

By the second half of the fifteenth century, the sultan sat at the apex of a hierarchical system and acted in political, military, judicial, social, and religious capacities under a variety of titles. He was theoretically responsible only to  God  and  God's law  (the Islamic شریعت şeriat, known in Arabic as شريعة  sharia ), of which he was the chief executor. His heavenly mandate was reflected in Islamic titles such as "shadow of God on Earth" (ظل الله في العالم ẓıll Allāh fī'l-ʿalem) and "caliph of the face of the earth" (خلیفه روی زمین Ḫalife-i rū-yi zemīn). All offices were filled by his authority, and every law was issued by him in the form of a decree called  firman  (فرمان).

In this organizational structure that prevailed until the second half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire minted gold coins on behalf of the Sultan.The Ottoman Empire put cash banknotes (Kaime-i nakdiye-i mutebere) into circulation in 1840. During the Crimean War, in 1854, the Ottoman Empire, which borrowed from other nations for the first time in history, needed a state bank to assume an intermediary function in the repayment of external debts. As a result, the “Ottoman Bank (Bank-ı Osmanî)”, headquartered in London, was established with English capital in 1856. The fundamental powers of the Bank were limited to lending in small amounts, making advance payments to the Government and discounting some Treasury bills.

The social system was organized around  millet . Millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity to non-Muslim populations across the  subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire  and at the same time it permitted their incorporation into the Ottoman administrative, economic and political system. The Ottoman-appointed governor collected taxes and provided security, while the local religious or cultural matters were left to the regional communities to decide. On the other hand, the sultans were Muslims and the laws that bound them were based on the  Sharia , the body of  Islam ic law, as well as various cultural customs. The Sultan, beginning in 1516, was also a  Caliph , the leader of all the  Sunni   Muslims  in the world. By the turn of the 19th century the Ottoman ruling elite recognized the need to restructure the legislative, military and judiciary systems to cope with their new political rivals in Europe. When the millet system started to lose its efficiency due to the  rise of nationalism within its borders , the Ottoman Empire explored new ways of governing its territory composed of diverse populations.

By 1900 nation states had formed in  Bulgaria ,  Greece ,  Montenegro  and  Serbia . Nevertheless, many of their ethnic compatriots lived under the control of the  Ottoman Empire . In 1912, these countries formed the  Balkan League . There were three main causes of the  First Balkan War .  The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.  Secondly, the Great Powers quarreled among themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.  Most important, the members of the Balkan League were confident that it could defeat the Turks. Their prediction was accurate, as Constantinople called for terms after six weeks of fighting.

As the  Encyclopaedia Iranica  states, "As orthodox or Sunni Muslims, the Ottomans had reason to view with alarm the progress of Shīʿī ideas in the territories under their control, but there was also a grave political danger that the Ṣafawīya, if allowed to extend its influence still further, might bring about the transfer of large areas in  Asia Minor  from Ottoman to Persian allegiance". By the early 1510s, Ismail's rapidly expansionist policies had made the Safavid border in Asia Minor shift even further west. In 1511, there was a widespread pro-Safavid rebellion in southern Anatolia by the Takkalu Qizilbash tribe, known as the  Şahkulu Rebellion , and an Ottoman army that was sent in order to put down the rebellion down was defeated. A large-scale incursion into Eastern Anatolia by Safavid  ghazis  under Nūr-ʿAlī Ḵalīfa coincided with the accession of Sultan  Selim I  in 1512 to the Ottoman throne, and became the  casus belli  which led to Selim's decision to invade Safavid Iran two years later. Selim and Ismail had been exchanging a series of belligerent letters prior to the attack. While the Safavid forces were at  Chaldiran  and planning on how to confront the Ottomans, Muhammad Khan Ustajlu, who served as the governor of  Diyabakir , and Nur-Ali Khalifa, a commander who knew how the Ottomans fought, proposed that they should attack as quickly as possible. This proposal was rejected by the powerful Qizilbash officer  Durmish Khan Shamlu , who rudely said that Muhammad Khan Ustajlu was only interested in the province which he governed. The proposal was rejected by Ismail himself, who said; "I am not a caravan-thief; whatever is decreed by God, will occur."

The modern and well trained Egyptians looked as though they could conquer the entire empire.  The Tsar of Russia, in keeping with his policy of reducing the Ottoman Sultan to a petty vassal, offered to form an alliance with the Sultan. In 1833, the two rulers negotiated the  Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi , in which Russia achieved the aim of securing complete dominance over the Ottomans. The Russians pledged to protect the Empire from external attacks; in turn, the Sultan pledged to close the Dardanelles to warships whenever Russia was at war. This provision of the Treaty raised a problem known as the "Straits Question". The agreement provided for the closure for all warships, but many European statesmen mistakenly believed that the clause allowed Russian vessels. Britain and France were angered by the misinterpreted clause; they also sought to contain Russian expansion. The two kingdoms, however, differed on how to achieve their objective; the British wished to uphold the Sultan, but the French preferred to make Mehmet Ali (whom they saw as more competent) the ruler of the entire Ottoman Empire. Russian intervention led the Sultan to negotiate a peace with Mehmet Ali in 1833, but war broke out once again in 1839.

In 1453,  Mehmed the conqueror  besieged the capital of the  Byzantine Empire , resulting in the  Fall of Constantinople  after 1,500 years of Roman rule. Thereafter, it renamed the city  Istanbul , making it the capital of the Empire.  During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of  Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a  powerful multinational, multilingual empire, which invaded and colonized much of  Southeast Europe ,  Western Asia , the  Caucasus ,  North Africa , and the  Horn of Africa . Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the great  migration of the Serbs  to escape prosecution. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained  32 provinces  and numerous  vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.

The Ottomans held talks with the  Armenian Revolutionary Federation  during the  Armenian congress at Erzurum  The main of opposition in Ottoman Empire to Turco-German alliance were the Armenian people, who for four years and without an organized government or a national army, played the same role in the Near East by preventing the Turco-German advance toward the interior of Asia as the Belgians played in the West by stopping the march of Germany toward Paris. According to Erickson, after the meeting in Erzurum the  Committee of Union and Progress  (CUP) was convinced of Armenian—Russian links with detailed plans aimed at the detachment of the region from the Ottoman Empire.

The system was one in which the projected revenue of a conquered territory was distributed in the form of temporary land grants among the  Sipahis  (cavalrymen) and other members of the military class including  Janissaries  and other  kuls  (slaves) of the  Sultan . These land grants were given as compensation for annual military service, for which they received no pay.  Timars could be small, granted by governors, or large which required a certificate from the  Sultan  but generally the  fief  had an annual value of less than twenty thousand  akçe s.  Although the military officers were granted land they did not have title which was retained by the Sultan.  If the military member died or left the land it reverted to the Sultan to be distributed to a new person.  Under this system the temporary owners could demand about three days labour per year from the peasants living on their land.  This is compared to two or three days a week under the Christian feudal system.

88_3	CAR_90dca1737442ff6a16df00706a3b92dc11a56097	Islam in Pristina began to be spread very early, during the Ottoman Rule. Before the  Battle of Kosovo  in 1389 the whole  Balkan  was  Christianized  by the Western and  Eastern Roman Empire .From that time until 1912 Kosovo was governed by the  Ottoman Empire  resulting in high level of  Islamization . But during the Yugoslavian Rule the population became largely  secularized . Islam was introduced to  Europe  via two main Peninsulas, the Iberian and the Balkan peninsula. With influences from Muslim Spain (Andalusia) from the west, the  Mediterranean  coast and  Sicily  from the south, and lastly Muslim Pechengs of  Hungary  from the north-east, Islam penetrated easily even to the most inner parts of the Balkans. One well known Muslim  geographer , historian and  cartographer   Al Idrisi  (1154) provided information about traveling to  Constantinople  from Albanian lands and vice versa. This made a huge impact on trading between the two civilizations. One thing to note is that the Albanians saw the fairness that the Muslim traders used in their deals and the very high advanced system and ideas, so many individuals began to accept the religion. This resulted in how Albanians dressed, how they cooked and the arts and architecture. Another way that Islam made it to the Balkans was also because of a prisoner who was captured by the  Byzantine Empire  and he spoke a lot about Islam while in prison. This was in the country of Pechengs which resulted the whole population to become Muslims. These connections for trade and commerce also had left other impacts on life in the Balkans. At that time, many Muslim merchants found good accommodations in the coastal cities, fertile valleys, crossroad towns or fortifications, and settled there. Thus, well before the end of the 11th century, Islam began to spread among them, and almost all Pechengs became Muslim. Migrations also played a role. Some of the travelers were missionaries and did the travelling on purpose to spread the word.

This was replaced by smaller groups, called eskouad, who operated on a reciprocal basis or conducted collective labor to other peasants for a price.

One Sufi order that appealed to Turks in Anatolia after 1300 was the  Safaviyya , an order that was originally Sunni and non-political but later became both Shi'a and political based in northwest  Iran . During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the Safavid and similar orders such as the  Bektaşi  became rivals of the  Ottomans —who were orthodox Sunni Muslims—for political control of eastern Anatolia. Although the Bektaşi order became accepted as a sect of orthodox Sunni Muslims, they did not abandon their heterodox  beliefs. In contrast, the Safavids eventually conquered Iran, shed their heterodox religious beliefs, and became proponents of orthodox Twelver Shi'a Islam.The conquest of the Byzantine capital of  Constantinople —which the Turks called  Istanbul —in 1453 enabled the Ottomans to consolidate their empire in Anatolia and  Thrace . The Ottomans later revived the title of caliph during the reign of Sultan Selim. Despite the absence of a formal institutional structure, Sunni religious functionaries played an important political role. Justice was dispensed by religious courts; in theory, the codified system of şeriat regulated all aspects of life, at least for the Muslim subjects of the empire. The head of the judiciary ranked directly below the sultan and was second in power only to the grand vizier. Early in the Ottoman period, the office of grand mufti of Istanbul evolved into that of  Şeyhülislam  (shaykh, or leader of Islam), which had ultimate jurisdiction over all the courts in the empire and consequently exercised authority over the interpretation and application of şeriat. Legal opinions pronounced by the Şeyhülislam were considered definitive interpretations.

His early work laid down the basics of the slave trade into the Ottoman Empire: kinds of work the enslaved were forced to do, hierarchy among types of enslaved persons, prices paid for them, customs duties levied upon entry into the Ottoman domains, the slave dealers, and the British attempts to have the Ottoman government suppress the traffic in enslaved Africans. He explored the gap between military-administrative elite slavery, domestic slaves in households, and agricultural enserfment-enslavement. His later work attempted to recover voices of enslaved persons, look at the enslaver-enslaved relationship as a coerced attachment, and examine what happened when trust was violated by the enslavers; it also looked at agency and resistance by the enslaved.  More recently he has explored the reasons for the fact that Muslim-majority societies generated limited antislavery argumentation and had weak abolitionist movements, if at all.

Due to the common occurrence of such intermarriages in the Ottoman Empire, they have had a significant impact on the ethnic makeup of the modern  Turkish  population in  Turkey , which now differs from that of the  Turkic  population in Central Asia. In addition to intermarriage, the large harems of Ottoman sultans often consisted almost entirely of female  concubines  who were of Christian European origin. Sultan  Ibrahim the Mad , Ottoman ruler from 1640 to 1648, is said to have drowned 280 concubines of his harem in the Bosphorus. At least one of his concubines,  Turhan Hatice , Ukrainian girl captured during one of the  raids by Tatars  and sold into  slavery , survived his reign.

Slaves are mentioned in at least twenty-nine verses of the Quran. including references to slave women, slave concubinage, and when to free slaves. Quran and hadiths recommended the institution of slavery, using the words 'abd' (slave) and the phrase  ma malakat aymanukum  ("that which your right hands own") to refer to women slaves, seized as captives of war. The Qur'an recognizes the basic inequality between master and women slave, between free women and slave women, as well as their unequal rights.  According to Muslim theologians, it has been lawful for male masters to have sexual relations with female captives and slaves without her consent; the purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was a motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history. Slave women did not have a right to free movement or consent, nor did they have a right to bride price or property such as a ‘‘mahr’’. Sikainga claims women slavery was widespread and "female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for members of their owners' household, their neighbors, and their guests."

88_3	CAR_b97f752b071624c8e0ebaea1b4343c89d777be94	Ottomanism was a form of  nationalism , likely inspired and created as a reaction to European ideas of nationalism and the growing Western involvement in the Ottoman Empire. Following the  Tanzimat  reforms, Ottomanism developed of of a need to bring the Empire together. The Ottomans feared the growing threat the Europeans posed, especially after events like the  Treaty of Balta Liman  that allowed for British merchants in the Empire to be taxed equally to the locals, and the growing concern of the Great Powers over the treatment of Christians and Jews within the Empire. The Ottomans thought that if they could unite the Empire fully under one state entity, then they would be stronger and the Europeans would have a harder time encroaching on Ottoman territory, as well as Ottoman people. Previously, the empire was vastly split into many small communities that mostly governed themselves. The Sultan oversaw these communities, however most adhered to their own laws and beliefs. This was a reason the  Ancien Regime  Ottoman Empire was so successful, because the Sultan didn't force any major changes on populations as he conquered them. Though because of nationalism, the rise of nation-states with shared senses of identities began to rise in Europe, most notably with the  Greek War of Independence  which also started affecting the Ottoman Empire. From these instances Ottomanism was developed as a social and political response, and a hope to help save the Empire from its downfall.

Orthodox Albanians under the Patriarchate of Constantinople had liturgy and schooling in Greek and toward the late Ottoman period mainly identified with Greek national aspirations. While Muslim Albanians during this period formed around 70% of the overall Balkan Albanian population in the Ottoman Empire with an estimated population of more than a million. With the rise of the Eastern Crisis, Muslim Albanians became torn between loyalties to the Ottoman state and the emerging Albanian nationalist movement. Islam, the Sultan and the Ottoman Empire were traditionally seen as synonymous in belonging to the wider Muslim community. While the Albanian nationalist movement advocated self-determination and strived to achieve socio-political recognition of Albanians as a separate people and language within the state. Between 1839 and 1876, the Ottoman Empire initiated modernising government reforms during the Tanzimat period and the Albanian Ottoman elite opposed them, in particular of having Ottoman officials from other parts of the empire sent to govern Ottoman Albanian areas and the introduction of a new centralised military recruitment system.

Though the Mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their Sultanate, including two in 1523, the Ottomans refrained from completely destroying the Mamluk hold over the power structure of Egypt. The Mamluks did suffer losses—both economic and military—in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory, and this was reflected in the lack of financial assistance provided to al-Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule.

The Ottomans carried out organized and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at the beginning of the war and portrayed deliberately provoked acts of Armenian resistance as rebellions to justify further extermination. In early 1915, a number of Armenians volunteered to join the Russian forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the  Tehcir Law  (Law on Deportation), which authorized the deportation of Armenians from the Empire's eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and 1918. The Armenians were intentionally  marched to death  and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands. While an exact number of deaths is unknown, the  International Association of Genocide Scholars  estimates 1.5 million. The government of Turkey has consistently  denied the genocide , arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims are rejected by most historians. Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including  Assyrians  and  Greeks , and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination.

In the 1431–1432 defter, Pavlo Kurtik held a timar of 26 villages subordinate to his son, Isa. The terms tahvil and vilayet-i Pavlo Kurtik shows that Pavlo Kurtik held the region before the Ottoman administration. His sons converted into Islam and became  subaşi , a royal or administrative title in the Ottoman Empire similar to lord or sheriff, of various Ottoman subdivisions throughout Ottoman Albania.

In  Constantinople  (present-day  Istanbul ), the administrative and political center of the Empire, about a fifth of the population consisted of slaves in 1609. Even after several measures to ban slavery in the late 19th century, the practice continued largely unfazed into the early 20th century. As late as 1908, female slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire.  Sexual slavery  was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution.

One side of the argument begins with the foundation of Constantinople political rulings after the fourth crusade: it was based more on the merchant, and less on an aristocratic ruler. This is the base of how the Ottoman Empire established authority and ruling, not much so by an aristocracy. Being that Islamic ruling served as the main authority of the people of Constantinople; the Shari’a had been the main way of jurisprudence for the Byzantine Empire. To gather an overall comprehensive idea of how Constantinople was ruled under the Turks and what system of governance was implemented, we must examine the ruler of Constantinople, or under the Turks, Istanbul, to see how the policy was directed towards the people, as well as the state of Constantinople during this time frame.

To staff its bureaucracy, the Ottoman Empire established a  janissary system  which seized hundreds of thousands of Christian boys through the  devşirme  system. They were well cared for but were legally slaves owned by the government and were not allowed to marry. They were never bought or sold. The Empire gave them significant administrative and military roles. The system began about 1365; there were 135,000 janissaries in 1826, when the system ended. After the  Battle of Lepanto , 12,000 Christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the  Ottoman fleet . Eastern Europe suffered a series of  Tatar invasions , the goal of which was to loot and capture slaves into jasyr. Seventy-five Crimean Tatar raids were recorded into  Poland–Lithuania  between 1474 and 1569.

Nineteenth-century travelers accounts tell of being served by black eunuch slaves. The trade was suppressed in the Ottoman Empire beginning in the mid-19th century, and slavery was legally abolished in 1887 or 1888.  Late 19th-century slaves in Palestine included enslaved Africans and the sold daughters of poor Palestinian peasants. Both Arabs and Jews owned slaves.  British mandate officials reported no chattel slavery in mandate Palestine as of 1924.
88_3	CAR_d79d73851c4d07c090bf5c771bfe7ab1ba0c8f88	Ottoman rule in the provinces was predicated upon maintaining the loyalty of local interest groups. State authority was represented by the provincial governor ( beylerbeyi ) and the judge ( kadı ), the latter carrying out most of the day-to-day administration of the province. Representing local interests were figures known as "notables" (ayan). Ayan came from diverse backgrounds; what distinguished them was their entrenched local status. Unlike Ottoman state officials, they did not generally migrate from position to position across the empire, but established deep roots within a small geographical area. Ayan utilized patronage networks to wield significant influence within their local city or region, and their cooperation was essential in order for Ottoman provincial administration to function. During the eighteenth century, ayan were tied to the state through the aforementioned institution of malikāne. By purchasing malikāne, ayan were able to consolidate their control over their local region of influence, but were also linked to the state in a symbiotic relationship. Just as the Ottoman government relied on them to maintain order in the provinces, so too did they come to rely on the Ottoman government to provide them with legitimacy and continued access to malikāne revenues. Thus paradoxically, the Ottoman government both granted provincial figures a greater degree of autonomy than ever before, while also tying them more closely to the central state in a mutually beneficial relationship. The central government and provincial power-holders thus remained interdependent, and the latter did not seek independence from the Ottoman Empire.
88_3	CAR_d85075a43a7bfe47f480734b00a15bbac399f350	Following the  Fall of Constantinople  on 29 May 1453, many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the  West , particularly  Italy ,  Central Europe ,  Germany  and  Russia . Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the  Ottoman Empire , due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on  Western Thrace  and  Greek Macedonia , both in  Northern Greece , and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital,  Constantinople . As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the  devshirme . Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors.

Though the "position of the domestic slave in Muslim society was in most respects better than in either  classical antiquity  or the nineteenth-century Americas", thanks to regulation by Sharia law, the enlightened incentives and opportunities for slaves to be emancipated meant there was a strong market for new slaves and thus strong incentive to enslave and sell human beings. Appalling loss of life and hardships often resulted from the processes of acquisition and transportation of slaves to Muslim lands and this drew the attention of European opponents of slavery. The continuing pressure from European countries eventually overcame the strong resistance of religious conservatives who were holding that forbidding what God permits is just as great an offence as to permit what God forbids. Slavery, in their eyes, was "authorized and regulated by the holy law". Even masters persuaded of their own piety and benevolence sexually exploited their concubines, without a thought of whether this constituted a violation of their humanity. There were also many pious Muslims who refused to have slaves and persuaded others to do so. Eventually, the Ottoman Empire's orders against the traffic of slaves were issued and put into effect.

In Albania and Montenegro, for example, local leaders paid nominal tribute to the Empire and otherwise had little contact. The  Republic of Ragusa  paid an annual tribute but otherwise was free to pursue its rivalry with the  Republic of Venice . The two Romance-speaking principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia had their own nobility, but were ruled by Greek families chosen by the Sultan. In Greece, the elite comprised clergymen and scholars, but there was scarcely any Greek aristocracy. A million or more Turks had settled in the Balkans, typically in smaller urban centers where they were garrison troops, civil servants, and craftsmen and merchants. There were also important communities of Jewish and Greek merchants. The Turks and Jews were not to be found in the countryside, so there was a very sharp social differentiation between the cities and their surrounding region in terms of language, religion and ethnicity. The Ottoman Empire collected taxes at about the 10% rate but there was no forced labor and the workers and peasants were not especially oppressed by the Empire.  The Sultan favoured and protected the Orthodox clergy, primarily as a protection against the missionary zeal of Roman Catholics.

Due to his proximity to the Sultan and the role the harem ladies played in court intrigues, the post ranked among the most important in the Ottoman Empire until the early 19th century.

The Ottoman state maintained the system by declaring dry-farming regions to be state owned and by protecting the integrity of the peasant household. The Ottoman state wanted all lands in the form of çiftlik in order to prevent the land's integration into landed properties and partition into smaller units. For this same reason, the central state often reassigned provincial governors to prevent them from acquiring loyalties. The system of timar-holding upheld this state centralism because the labor of the peasants helped maintain the military exploits of the empire—providing not only revenue but labor in the form of land cultivation and collection of firewood and straw for military families. However, the peasants resented these direct forms of servitude towards land holders, which is why the central state sought to maintain or even convert land to the çiftlik form of taxation. A main concern of the state was to keep peasants on the land, which was why peasants were not allowed to relocate. Land holders were incentivized to keep peasants on the land because peasant work was their main source of revenue.

Goltz was a militarist, Social Darwinist and an ultra-nationalist who saw war as something necessary, desirable and inevitable, writing: "It [war] is an expression of the energy and self-respect which a nation possesses...  Perpetual peace means perpetual death!".  Goltz’s most important idea, which was to greatly influence the Unionists was that of the "nation in arms", that henceforward in modern war, the side that could mobilise best the entire resources of its society would be the one that would win, and as such the best thing that could done was to militarise one’s society in peacetime to ensure that it would be a "nation in arms" when the inevitable war came.  Goltz, who spoke fluent Turkish and was very popular with the officers he had trained expressed a great deal of admiration for the Turks as a naturally warlike people, in contrast to his country where he believed that hedonism was rendering the next generation of young German men unfit for war.  After Goltz published an article praising the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, one Unionist Major Ali Fuad wrote in response:Goltz was also an intense Anglophobe who believed that the great struggle of the coming 20th century would be a world war between Britain and Germany for the mastery of the world; for him it was self-evident that the world was just too small for the British and German empires to co-exist, and he urged his protégés in the Ottoman Army to ensure that the empire fought on the side of his country when the inevitable Anglo-German war broke out.

In early 1915, Enver ordered that all 200,000 Ottoman Armenian soldiers, now disarmed in the labour battalions be killed. The decision to enter the war and the decision to begin the genocide were part and parcel of the same progress as the war held out the promise of national greatness once the Allies were defeated while the Armenians were seen as an inner enemy holding the Turks back from the national glory that was the dream of the Unionist central committee. Furthermore, the war-time radicalising atmosphere of emergency and national crisis made it possible to pursue policies that would be seen as unacceptable in peace-time. Since Britain and France were the principal liberal states in Europe and the Armenians as a minority the principal advocates of liberalism within the Ottoman Empire, the government linked the external enemy with the alleged internal enemy as liberalism everywhere was portrayed as the enemy of the Ottoman state; since the German government portrayed the war in similar terms as an ideological battle between the forces of "German order" vs. Anglo-French liberalism and democracy, it is not surprising that the Unionists should choose Germany as their ally. Finally, the war was intended to lead to the Ottoman state becoming greater and more powerful than had ever been; in the world envisioned by the Unionist leaders, Ottoman society was to become exclusively Turkish and Muslim; there was no place for the Christian Armenians in this society. Further increasing the sense of crisis was the beginning of the Gallipoli campaign in March 1915, when British and French warships tried to force the Dardanelles, only to be prevented by sea mines in the Dardanelles and by the Ottoman howitzers on Gallipoli, which prevented minesweepers from clearing the minefields. Constantinople was not only the empire's capital, largest city and the economic heart of the empire, it was also the place where the weapons from Germany essential to sustaining the war arrived. If Constantinople fell, the empire was doomed. For many, the landings of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops on Gallipoli in April 1915 seemed to mark the harbinger of the empire's destruction and a sense of extreme national crisis emerged amongst the Ottoman population. Owing to the importance of Constantinople, the CUP regime made desperate efforts to win the  Battle of Gallipoli , which was a bloodbath right from the start with extremely heavy losses on both sides; one Ottoman officer called Gallipoli an "inferno" and "a ritual of fire and death". The Ottoman troops were told by their imām that as the war was jihad every man who "martyred" himself for Allah by being killed in the battle would be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven, which helps to explain why the Ottoman soldiers at Gallipoli fought with such indifference to death.
88_4	CAR_1731e9428663ec3670a3ca93fae71a6a4c700da7	During the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, Pan-Islamism had become a hugely important part of the state ideology as Abdul Hamid had often stressed his claim to be the  caliph . The claim that Abdul Hamid was the caliph, making him the political and spiritual leader of all Muslims not only caught on within the Ottoman Empire, but throughout the entire Dar-al-Islam (the "House of Islam", i.e. the Islamic world), especially in  India . At that time, British India comprised all of modern-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Despite deposing Abdul Hamid in 1909, the CUP continued his pan-Islamic policies. For the CUP, keeping the sultanate-caliphate in being had the effect of not only reinforcing the loyalty of Ottoman Muslims to the empire, but was also a useful foreign policy tool.  The fact that Indian Muslims seemed to have far more enthusiasm for the Ottoman sultan-caliph than they did for the British king-emperor was a matter of considerable concern for British decision-makers. The fear that the sultan-caliph might declare jihad against the British, and thereby plunge India into a revolt by its Muslims was a constant factor in British policy towards the Ottoman Empire.  On the other side, starting in 1897 Germany had a policy of  Weltpolitik  (World Politics), in which the Reich sought to become the world’s dominant power.  As part of its programme of Weltpolitik, Germany had courted the Ottoman Empire through a policy of providing generous loans to the Ottoman state (which had gone bankrupt in 1881, and which had trouble getting loans as a result), weapons and German officers to train the Ottoman army.  The price of these loans, weapons and the German military mission to train the army was that the Ottoman state had to favour German corporations when awarding railway concessions and other public works, thus pushing the empire further into the German political and economic sphere of influence. An official German-Ottoman alliance was not signed until 1914, but from 1898 onwards, there was an unofficial German-Ottoman alliance. In 1898, the German emperor had visited the empire, in course of which Wilhelm II had proclaimed himself the "protector of Islam" before a cheering crowd. A large part of the reason for the German interest in the Ottomans was the belief by decision-makers in Berlin that the sultan-caliph could mobilise all of the world's Muslims to Germany's cause. Beyond that, having the Ottoman Empire as an ally would mean that in the event of a war, Russian and especially British forces that otherwise would be deployed against Germany would be sent to fight the Ottomans instead.  In 1914, the German emperor  Wilhelm II  saw a message on the margin on a diplomatic cable from St. Petersburg reading: "Our consuls in Turkey and India, our people must incite the entire Islamic world to a savage revolt against this... cursed, perfidious, conscience-less nation [Russia].

The Ottoman Law of 1884 was made in response to the increase of foreign interest in the area and the looting of archaeological material from the Empire. Its main purpose was for regulating the trafficking of antiquities.  	The 1884 Law established national ownership over all artifacts in the Ottoman Empire and sought to regulate scientific access to antiquities and sites. Under this law, all artifacts discovered during excavation were the property of the National Museum in  Constantinople  and were sent there.While the law can be seen as the first step towards regulation, it can also be seen as  imperialism  since the Ottoman Empire's desired to gain material from its territories rather than for the preservation of the archaeological legacy. By controlling archaeological goods and taxing the antiquities, the government effectively regulated European access to heritage.
88_4	CAR_434c8ff84004e4b597188fec4b2763f5044fa54c	In 1204, after the  Fourth Crusade  conquered  Constantinople , the  crusaders  established a  Latin Empire  (1204–1261) in that city, while the defeated Byzantine Empire's descendants established two smaller, short-lived empires in  Asia Minor : the  Empire of Nicaea  (1204–1261) and the  Empire of Trebizond  (1204–1461). Constantinople was retaken in 1261 by the Byzantine successor state centered in  Nicaea , re-establishing the  Byzantine Empire  until 1453, by which time the  Turkish - Muslim   Ottoman Empire  (ca. 1300–1918), had conquered most of the region. The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire and it was the most powerful empire to succeed the Abbasi empires at the time, as well as one of the most powerful empires in the world. The Ottoman Empire centered on modern day Turkey, dominated the eastern Mediterranean, overthrew the Byzantine Empire to claim Constantinople and it would start battering at Austria and Malta, which were countries that were key to central and to south-west Europe respectively — mainly for their geographical location. The reason these occurrences of batterings were so important was because the Ottomans were Muslim, and the rest of Europe was Christian, so there was a sense of religious fighting going on. This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims. Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries, and they had problems in them as well. The flows of trade and of cultural influences across the supposed great divide never ceased, so the countries never stopped bartering with each other. These epochal clashes between civilizations profoundly shaped many people's thinking back then, and continues to do so in the present day. Modern hatred against Muslim communities in South-Eastern Europe, mainly in Bosnia and Kosovo, has often been articulated in terms of seeing them as unwelcome residues of this imperialism: in short, as Turks. Moreover, Eastern Orthodox imperialism was not re-established until the coronation of  Peter the Great  as  Emperor of Russia  in 1721. Likewise, with the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the  Napoleonic Wars  (1803–1815), the  Austrian Empire  (1804–1867) emerged reconstituted as the Empire of  Austria–Hungary  (1867–1918), having "inherited" the imperium of Central and Western Europe from the losers of said wars.
88_4	CAR_4351d7d2e0b3b75fca8b725f4f3ee9f82485c057	The  Ottoman Empire  saw military expansion and fiscalism as the source of wealth, with agriculture seen as more important than manufacture and commerce. Berkes described the Ottoman economy as a "war economy" where its primary revenue comprised booty from expansion. This idea has been supported by Ottomanists  Halil İnalcik  and  Suraiya Faroqhi  . Western mercantilists gave more emphasis to manufacture and industry in the wealth-power-wealth equation, moving towards capitalist economics comprising expanding industries and markets whereas the Ottomans continued along the trajectory of territorial expansion, traditional monopolies, conservative land holding and agriculture. In economic terms, neither the Marxian Asiatic mode of production, nor the feudal mode found in medieval Europe reflect the Ottoman economy accurately, as it falls somewhere in between the two — excess peasant production was taxed by the state as opposed to it being paid in rent to feudal lords.

Jewelry had particular importance as it was commonly given at weddings, as a gift that could be used as a form of savings. Silver was the most common material used, with gold reserved for more high-status pieces; designs often displayed complex filigree work and incorporated Persian and Byzantine motifs. Developments in design reflected the tastes of the  Ottoman court , with Persian  Safavid  art, for example, becoming an influence after the Ottoman defeat of  Ismail I  after the  Battle of Chaldiran  in 1514. In the rural areas of the Empire, jewelry was simpler and often incorporated gold coins (the Ottoman altin), but the designs of Constantinople nevertheless spread throughout Ottoman territory and were reflected even in the metalwork of  Egypt  and North Africa.

The  partitioning  was planned in several agreements made by the Allies early in the course of World War I, notably the  Sykes-Picot Agreement . As world war loomed, the  Ottoman Empire  sought protection but was rejected by Britain, France, and Russia, and finally formed the  Ottoman–German Alliance . The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new  states . The Ottoman Empire had been the leading  Islam ic state in  geopolitical , cultural and ideological terms. The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire led to the rise in the  Middle East  of Western powers such as Britain and France and brought the creation of the modern  Arab world  and the Republic of  Turkey . Resistance to the influence of these powers came from the  Turkish national movement  but did not become widespread in the post-Ottoman states until after World War II.

Additionally, the Romanian scholar described the Ottoman Empire itself as the inheritor of Byzantine government,  legal culture  and civilization, up to the  Age of Revolution .

The earliest conflicts began during the  Byzantine–Ottoman Wars  in the 13th century, followed by the  Bulgarian–Ottoman Wars  and the  Serbian–Ottoman Wars  in the 14th century. Much of this period was characterized by  Ottoman expansion into the Balkans . The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into  Central Europe  in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.

In 1453,  Mehmed the conqueror  besieged the capital of the  Byzantine Empire , resulting in the  Fall of Constantinople  after 1,500 years of Roman rule. Thereafter, it renamed the city  Istanbul , making it the capital of the Empire.  During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of  Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a  powerful multinational, multilingual empire, which invaded and colonized much of  Southeast Europe ,  Western Asia , the  Caucasus ,  North Africa , and the  Horn of Africa . Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the great  migration of the Serbs  to escape prosecution. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained  32 provinces  and numerous  vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.

The attack prompted Russia and its allies, Britain and France, to declare war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914. The Ottoman Empire was active in the  Balkans theatre  and  Middle Eastern theatre  - the latter had five main campaigns: the  Sinai and Palestine Campaign , the  Mesopotamian Campaign , the  Caucasus Campaign , the  Persian Campaign , and the  Gallipoli Campaign . There were also several minor campaigns: the  North African Campaign , the  Arab Campaign  and the  South Arabia Campaign . There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the  Battle of Gallipoli  and the  Siege of Kut . The  Armistice of Mudros  was signed on 31 October 1918, ending the Ottoman participation in World War I.

According to Cameron, regarding themselves as "heirs" of Byzantium, the Ottomans preserved important aspects of its tradition, which in turn facilitated an "Orthodox revival" during the  post-communist  period of the Eastern European states.

The  Middle Eastern theatre of World War I  became the scene of action. The combatants were the Ottoman Empire, with some assistance from the other Central Powers, against primarily the British and the Russians among the  Allies . Rebuffed elsewhere by the major European powers, the Young Turks, through highly secret diplomatic negotiations, led the Ottoman Empire to ally itself with Germany. The Young Turks needed to modernize the Empire’s communications and transportation networks without putting themselves in the hands of European bankers. Europeans already owned much of the country’s railroad system, and since 1881, the administration of the defaulted Ottoman foreign debt had been in European hands.  During the War, the Young Turk empire was "virtually an economic colony on the verge of total collapse."

In accordance with an agreement made with the republican  Young Ottomans , he promulgated the first  Ottoman constitution of 1876  on 23 December 1876, which was a sign of progressive thinking that marked his early rule. Soon, however, he claimed Western influence on Ottoman affairs and citing disagreements with Parliament, Abdul Hamid suspended both the short-lived constitution and  Parliament  in 1878 and seized absolute power, ending the  first constitutional era  of the Ottoman Empire. Abdul Hamid's 1909 removal from the throne was hailed by most Ottoman citizens, who welcomed the  return to constitutional rule  after three decades.

Ottoman military reforms  resulted in the  Ottoman Army  engaging in the  Italo-Turkish War  (1911), the  Balkan Wars  (1912-1913), and the continuous unrest caused by the  Ottoman countercoup of 1909 , which preceded the  31 March Incident  (Restoration, 1909) and  1912 Ottoman coup d'état  (Saviours) and the  1913 Ottoman coup d'état ) in the Empire up to  World War I . The  Ottoman entry into World War I  in the  Middle Eastern theatre  ended with the  partition of the Ottoman Empire  under the terms of the  Treaty of Sèvres . This treaty, as designed in the  conference of London , gave a nominal land and permitted the title  Ottoman Caliphate  (compared with  Vatican ;  a  sacerdotal - monarchical  state ruled by the Catholic  Pope ), not to be a further threat but just powerful enough to protect Britain from the  Khilafat Movement .

The waning influence of  Istanbul  in the Gulf forced it to make concessions without much to gain in return. The Ottoman Empire had faced a number of setbacks in the last few decades—a few of its provinces achieved independence, some were annexed by other countries, or many lost in conflict—and for internal political reasons it may have seemed important to maintain Kuwait as part of the empire, even if only symbolically. The Ottomans also felt that making this agreement would ensure British support on other more pressing issues, such as dealing with invasion by other European powers and conflicts in other parts of the  Ottoman Empire . Furthermore, British pressures led the Ottomans to abandon the proposed extension of the railway line to Kuwait and instead opt for a  Basra  terminus. Plans for a Basra terminus created a new series of demands on behalf of the British, including the Ottoman renunciation of Qatar, and delineating its role in the wider Persian Gulf waters. Britain had wanted to conclude agreements with Sheikh of Qatar Jasim al-Thani about illicit arms traffic and maritime peace, and also sought to formally establish its dominance in the Gulf.  By May 6, 1913 Britain and the Ottoman Empire initialed the compromise and the Anglo-Ottoman Convention was signed on July 29, 1913, two years exact from the first memorandum.

The Ottoman Empire continued to stretch northwards, taking  Hungary  in the 16th century, and reaching as far north as the  Podolia  in the mid-17th century ( Peace of Buczacz ), by which time most of the Balkans was under Ottoman control. Ottoman expansion in Europe ended with their defeat in the  Great Turkish War . In the  Treaty of Karlowitz  (1699), the Ottoman Empire lost most of its conquests in  Central Europe . The Crimean Khanate was later annexed by  Russia  in 1783.

The Ottoman Empire for the next few decades after the  Crimean War  leading up to  World War I  would have to squash nationalist sentiment in many of its provinces. The once mighty and flourishing united empire was splintering as many  ethnic groups  cried out for more rights—most notably self-rule. Britain and France may have for the time being allowed the situation in  Europe  to stabilize, but the Peace of Paris did little to create lasting stability in the  Concert of Europe . The  Ottomans  joined the  Concert of Europe  after the Peace was signed, but most European nations looked to the crumbling empire with either hungry or terrified eyes. The  Crimean War  revealed to the world just how important solving the “Eastern Question” was to the stability of Europe; however, the Peace of Paris provided no clear answer or guidance. Due to the importance of the Ottoman Empire to Britain and France in maintaining the balance of power in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, many view the signing of the Treaty of Paris as the entrance of the Ottoman Empire into the European international theater. Greater penetration of European influence into Ottoman international law and a decline in emphasis of Islamic practices in their legal system following the Treaty illustrate more of an inclusion of the Empire into European politics and disputes, leading to its major role in the First World War.

The financial control extended to the approval or supervision of the national budget, financial laws and regulations, and total control over the  Ottoman Bank . The  Ottoman Public Debt Administration  (instituted in 1881) was redesigned to include only British, French and Italian bond holders. The Ottoman debt problem dated back to the time of the  Crimean War  (1854–56), during which the Ottoman Empire had borrowed money from abroad, mainly from France. During the  Conference of Lausanne , the council decided that the Republic of Turkey was responsible for 67% of the annuity of the pre-war debt; the question of how payment was to be made, however, was not resolved until 1928. Also the  capitulations of the Ottoman Empire  were restored to prior to 1914. Capitulations were abolished in the first year of the war by  Talaat Pasha . The control also extended to import and export duties, the reorganization of the electoral system, and the proportional representation of the "races" within the Empire. The Empire was required to grant freedom of transit to persons, goods, vessels, etc., passing through her territory, and goods in transit were to be free of all customs duties.

88_4	CAR_d02e12a344ef460dc0983fd9bced1616eee02629	Press discussion and photographs have been particularly important in educating the public about the Genocide. Press coverage is also considered valuable and important because it constitutes  primary source s of direct evidence. During the time period, much of the global press had condemned the nature of the massacres and calls for aid of the Armenians. Coverage of the Armenian Genocide was done by many throughout the world and were often similar when depicting the massacres. Many well-known newspapers in the English language such as  The Times ,  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post ,  The Los Angeles Times ,  The Globe and Mail ,  The Toronto Star ,  The Montreal Gazette , and others also reported extensively about the events. It is believed that The New York Times published thousands of articles pertaining to the Armenian massacres between 1894-1922 and 124 articles in 1915 alone. Some countries, like Australia, relied largely on news agencies in Europe for their information. It is noted that newspapers such as The Washington Post and The New York Times reported on the Armenian massacres almost daily for over a year. The coverage mainly included reports by correspondents, travelers, and consuls or ambassadors of different countries based in the different regions of the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, detailed reports came from missionaries who witnessed the massacres and attempted to aid orphans and other survivors. Local press coverage in the Ottoman Empire came mainly from the  Takvim-i Vekayi , the official gazette of the Ottoman government. During the  Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–1920 , the newspaper became especially important because it reported the cross-examinations of Turkish officials and the verdict of court which sentenced Talat, Enver, and Cemal Pashas to death for their roles in massacres against Armenians. Noteworthy studies of the press coverage of Muslim communities in the Middle East and particularly that of Syria have also been instrumental in depicting first hand accounts of the Armenian deportees exiled to the area. The Syrian press also made note of the demographic impact of the Armenian deportees into the region and condemned the Ottoman government for what it largely believed was a campaign of "annihilation", "extermination", and the "uprooting of a race".
88_4	CAR_d9712f7420938572aa71de343e0bc5e7ec9837c0	Interactions between Ottomans and Britons occurred throughout history, but in the 18th century, European visitors and residents in the Ottoman Empire markedly increased, and exploded in the 19th century. As such, fashion is one method to gauge the increased interactions. Historically, Europeans clothing was more delineated between male and female dress. Hose and trousers were reserved for men, and skirts were for women. Conversely, in the Ottoman Empire, male and female dress was more similar. A common item worn by both was the şalvar, a voluminous undergarment in white fabric shaped like what are today called “harem pants". To British women traveling in the Ottoman Empire, the şalvar quickly became a symbol of freedom because they observed that Ottoman women had more rights than British women did. Lady Mary Wortley Montague (1689-1762), whose husband was the British Ambassador to Istanbul, noted in her travels in her “Embassy Letters” that Ottoman women “possessed legal property rights and protections that far surpassed the rights of Western women”. These female travelers often gained an intimate view of Ottoman culture, since as women, they had easier access to the Muslim Elite harems than did men. Şalvar successfully spread into Europe at the end of the 19th century as various female suffragists and feminists used şalvar as a symbol of emancipation. Other British women of distinction, such as Lady (Janey) Archibal Campbell (1845-1923), and Lady Ottoline (Violet Anne) Morrell (1873-1938) wore şalvar “in an attempt to symbolize their refusal of traditional British standards and sexual differences”. Şalvar also spread beyond Europe when Amelia Jenks Bloomer modified these “Turkish trousers” to create American “bloomers”. 	Another area where the Ottomans influenced female Western dress was in layering. Initially, layering had a practical use for the ancestors of the Ottoman Empire, who were pastoral nomads and horse riders, and needed to wear layers to adapt to changing temperatures. But as the Ottoman Empire came into being, the layering of garments would distinguish one’s gender, class, or rank within particular communities, while also displaying many sumptuous fabrics, thus signaling one’s wealth and status. Layering also had spiritual significance. For instance, in Islamic art, layering different patterns represents a spiritual metaphor of the divine order that seems to be incomprehensible, but is actually planned and meaningful

As the Early Modern period Moslem culture restricted women's movement outside the home and regulated their dress if they did venture outside, the Jews of the Ottoman Empire also began adopting these practices.  Portuguese Jewish men during this time period were especially protective of their female counterparts, and would seclude them from other aspects of society.
88_5	CAR_1385b3cbceee8a1321506e470cd92abd3ae51b5d	Ottoman architecture  has shaped and left visible marks on the  Balkan  urban landscape. Two distinct crafts are evident in Ottoman urban culture that of the architect and that of the master builder (maistores in Macedonia and Epirus, kalfa in Anatolia and sometimesin Bulgaria) who shared the responsibilities and tasks for the design and construction of all sorts of building projects. During  Mimar Sinan 's period as a chief imperial architect until the second half of the 16th century between forty and seventy architects produced designs for a very large labour force, controlled the construction of military and civil facilities, water and road infrastructure from  Budapest  to  Cairo . The centralized has or hassa (sultan's property and service) system had allowed a small number of architects to control all significant imperial and most vakif building sites over the vast territories of the empire. In the 18th century the empire was opened to Western influence. By the late 18th century a growing number of Ottoman Christians were recruited. Until the very end of the Ottoman state the master builders maintained a cultural equilibrium between the Ottoman spirit and architectural innovation both in the Balkans and Anatolia. Turkish, Slavic, and Greek masters combining Western styles with Ottoman views extended the architectural landscape with one of the best examples being the  Filibe - Plovdiv  symmetrical house. Innovations were derived from the Ottoman house and market (çarşı) buildings in  Anatolia, Macedonia, and Bulgaria.

In early 1915, Enver ordered that all 200,000 Ottoman Armenian soldiers, now disarmed in the labour battalions be killed. The decision to enter the war and the decision to begin the genocide were part and parcel of the same progress as the war held out the promise of national greatness once the Allies were defeated while the Armenians were seen as an inner enemy holding the Turks back from the national glory that was the dream of the Unionist central committee. Furthermore, the war-time radicalising atmosphere of emergency and national crisis made it possible to pursue policies that would be seen as unacceptable in peace-time. Since Britain and France were the principal liberal states in Europe and the Armenians as a minority the principal advocates of liberalism within the Ottoman Empire, the government linked the external enemy with the alleged internal enemy as liberalism everywhere was portrayed as the enemy of the Ottoman state; since the German government portrayed the war in similar terms as an ideological battle between the forces of "German order" vs. Anglo-French liberalism and democracy, it is not surprising that the Unionists should choose Germany as their ally. Finally, the war was intended to lead to the Ottoman state becoming greater and more powerful than had ever been; in the world envisioned by the Unionist leaders, Ottoman society was to become exclusively Turkish and Muslim; there was no place for the Christian Armenians in this society. Further increasing the sense of crisis was the beginning of the Gallipoli campaign in March 1915, when British and French warships tried to force the Dardanelles, only to be prevented by sea mines in the Dardanelles and by the Ottoman howitzers on Gallipoli, which prevented minesweepers from clearing the minefields. Constantinople was not only the empire's capital, largest city and the economic heart of the empire, it was also the place where the weapons from Germany essential to sustaining the war arrived. If Constantinople fell, the empire was doomed. For many, the landings of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops on Gallipoli in April 1915 seemed to mark the harbinger of the empire's destruction and a sense of extreme national crisis emerged amongst the Ottoman population. Owing to the importance of Constantinople, the CUP regime made desperate efforts to win the  Battle of Gallipoli , which was a bloodbath right from the start with extremely heavy losses on both sides; one Ottoman officer called Gallipoli an "inferno" and "a ritual of fire and death". The Ottoman troops were told by their imām that as the war was jihad every man who "martyred" himself for Allah by being killed in the battle would be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven, which helps to explain why the Ottoman soldiers at Gallipoli fought with such indifference to death.

This mix originally began as a result of the encounter of Turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during  their migration  from Central Asia to the West. Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a "modern" Western state, while maintaining traditional religious and historical values.
88_5	CAR_1bbdf809c56cb709fdd2f18275e5ebb45ea02a00	Turkish culture has undergone profound changes over the last century. Today, Turkey may be the only country that contains every extreme of Eastern and Western culture (along with many compromises and fusions between the two). The Ottoman system was a multi-ethnic state that enabled people within it not to mix with each other and thereby retain separate ethnic and religious identities within the empire (albeit with a dominant Turkish and Southern European ruling class). Upon the fall of the empire after World War I the Turkish Republic adapted a unitary approach, which forced all the different cultures within its borders to mix with each other with the aim of producing national and cultural identity. This mixing, instead of producing  cultural homogenization , instead resulted in many shades of grey as the traditional Muslim cultures of Anatolia collided with the cosmopolitan modernity of Istanbul and the wider West.
88_5	CAR_242cf8015e31f8049804e0bf57898716d8e9145f	Following the adoption of  Islam  c. 950 by the  Kara-Khanid Khanate  and the  Seljuq Turks , who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the  Ottomans , the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from  Arabic  and  Persian .  Turkish literature  during the Ottoman period, particularly  Ottoman Divan poetry , was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. The literary and official language during the  Ottoman Empire  period (c. 1299–1922) is termed  Ottoman Turkish , which was a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period's everyday Turkish. The everyday Turkish, known as kaba Türkçe or "rough Turkish", spoken by the less-educated lower and also rural members of society, contained a higher percentage of native vocabulary and served as basis for the modern Turkish language.

At the same time the  Qanun  (or Kanun), a secular legal system, co-existed with religious law or  Sharia . The Ottoman Empire was always organized around a system of local  jurisprudence . Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority. Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local  millet . The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups. The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the "trade court". The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative Qanun, i.e. laws, a system based upon the Turkic  Yassa  and  Töre , which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.

The social system was organized around the  millet  structure. The millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity across the society but at the same time permitted the religious ideology to be incorporated into the administrative, economic and political system. One can define this way of life  as  Islamism  (Political Islam): "the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life".

The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in Africa and  Circassia  in the Caucasus. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations.  Enslavement of  Caucasians  was banned in the early 19th century, while slaves from other groups were allowed. In  Constantinople  (present-day  Istanbul ), the administrative and political center of the Empire, about a fifth of the population consisted of slaves in 1609. 
88_5	CAR_2c113ad10be867aa6d82911664f1e0cb62a59e81	Before the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the  state organisation of the Ottoman Empire  was a system that had two main dimensions, which were the military administration and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The Ottomans practiced a system in which the state (as in the Byzantine Empire) had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic  Iran  remained important in Ottoman administrative circles. According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders within the overarching context of  orthodox  Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.
88_5	CAR_3055ee52d4294bd94d0ba809a4ea3b7d7c414f97	The Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered, and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (in fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who elaborated them into new forms, which resulted in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the  Sultanate of Rum  and the  Seljuk Empire , were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits and customs, and therefore, the empire has been described as a  Persianate  empire. Intercultural marriages also played their part in creating the characteristic Ottoman elite culture. When compared to the Turkish folk culture, the influence of these new cultures in creating the culture of the Ottoman elite was clear.
88_5	CAR_39d4c6a9f3096b82fd94779eaf79f4438344f7d9	The Ottoman conquest also brought social, cultural and linguistic changes into the Albanian-speaking world. From the fifteenth century onward words from Ottoman Turkish entered the Albanian language. While a corpus of poets and other Muslim Albanian authors wrote in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian or in the Albanian language in Arabic script ( aljamiado ) encompassing narrative prose, poetry, reflective works on religion and socio-political situations and so on. Prominent amongst these authors were  Yahya bey Dukagjini ,  Haxhi Shehreti  or  bejtexhinj  poets like  Nezim Frakulla ,  Muhamet Kyçyku ,  Sulejman Naibi ,  Hasan Zyko Kamberi ,  Haxhi Ymer Kashari  and others. Towns and cities in Albania underwent change as they adopted Ottoman architectural and cultural elements.  Apart from Elbasan founded (1466) around a fortress, other settlements with the construction of buildings related to religion, education and social purposes like mosques, madrassas, imarets and so on by the Ottoman Muslim Albanian elite became new urban centres like Korçë, Tiranë and Kavajë. Older urban centres for example Berat attained mosques,  hamams  (Ottoman bathhouses), madrasas (Muslim religious schools), coffee houses, tekes and became known for its poets, artists and scholarly pursuits. Unlike Kosovo or Macedonia, architecturally Albania's Ottoman Muslim heritage was more modest in number, though prominent structures are the  Mirahori Mosque  in Korçë (built 1495–96),  Murad Bey Mosque  in  Krujë  (1533–34),  Lead Mosque  in Shkodër (1773–74),   Et'hem Bey Mosque  in Tiranë (begun 1791–94; finished 1820–21) and others. Conversion from Christianity to Islam for Albanians also marked a transition from  Rum  (Christian) to Muslim confessional communities within the Ottoman  millet system  that collectively  divided and governed peoples according to their religion. The Ottomans were nonetheless aware of the existence of Muslim Albanians and used terms like Arnavud (اروانيد) extensively as an ethnic marker to address the shortcomings of the usual millet religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records. While the country was referred to as Arnavudluk (آرناوودلق). Also a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym. The ethnic demonym Shqiptarë, derived from Latin connoting clear speech and verbal understanding gradually replaced Arbëresh/Arbënesh amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

88_5	CAR_3d810215f1edf6cfad431e20ad19a8bd31c32db0	Byzantine music (), in a narrow sense, is the music of the  Byzantine Empire . Originally it consisted of songs and hymns composed to Greek texts used for courtly ceremonials, during festivals, or as paraliturgical and liturgical music. The ecclesiastical forms of Byzantine music are the best known forms today, because different Orthodox traditions still identify with the heritage of Byzantine music, when their cantors sing monodic chant out of the traditional chant books like  sticherarion  which in fact consisted of five books, and the  heirmologion . Byzantine music did not disappear after the  fall of Constantinople . Its traditions continued under the  Patriarchate of Constantinople  which was annexed by the Islamic Ottoman ruler  Sultan Mehmed II  in 1453, and granted administrative responsibilities over all Orthodox Christians. During the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, burgeoning splinter nations in the Balkans declared autonomy or "autocephaly" against the  Ecumenical Patriarchate . The new self-declared patriarchates were independent nations defined by their religion. In this context, Christian religious chant practiced in the  Ottoman empire ,  Bulgaria  and  Greece  among other nations, was based on the historical roots of the art tracing back to the Byzantine Empire, while the music of the Patriarchate created during the  Ottoman  period was often regarded as "post-Byzantine." This explains why Byzantine music refers to several Orthodox Christian chant traditions of the Mediterranean and of the Caucasus practiced in recent history and even today, and this article cannot be limited to the music culture of the Byzantine past.
88_5	CAR_434c8ff84004e4b597188fec4b2763f5044fa54c	In 1204, after the  Fourth Crusade  conquered  Constantinople , the  crusaders  established a  Latin Empire  (1204–1261) in that city, while the defeated Byzantine Empire's descendants established two smaller, short-lived empires in  Asia Minor : the  Empire of Nicaea  (1204–1261) and the  Empire of Trebizond  (1204–1461). Constantinople was retaken in 1261 by the Byzantine successor state centered in  Nicaea , re-establishing the  Byzantine Empire  until 1453, by which time the  Turkish - Muslim   Ottoman Empire  (ca. 1300–1918), had conquered most of the region. The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire and it was the most powerful empire to succeed the Abbasi empires at the time, as well as one of the most powerful empires in the world. The Ottoman Empire centered on modern day Turkey, dominated the eastern Mediterranean, overthrew the Byzantine Empire to claim Constantinople and it would start battering at Austria and Malta, which were countries that were key to central and to south-west Europe respectively — mainly for their geographical location. The reason these occurrences of batterings were so important was because the Ottomans were Muslim, and the rest of Europe was Christian, so there was a sense of religious fighting going on. This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims. Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries, and they had problems in them as well. The flows of trade and of cultural influences across the supposed great divide never ceased, so the countries never stopped bartering with each other. These epochal clashes between civilizations profoundly shaped many people's thinking back then, and continues to do so in the present day. Modern hatred against Muslim communities in South-Eastern Europe, mainly in Bosnia and Kosovo, has often been articulated in terms of seeing them as unwelcome residues of this imperialism: in short, as Turks. Moreover, Eastern Orthodox imperialism was not re-established until the coronation of  Peter the Great  as  Emperor of Russia  in 1721. Likewise, with the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the  Napoleonic Wars  (1803–1815), the  Austrian Empire  (1804–1867) emerged reconstituted as the Empire of  Austria–Hungary  (1867–1918), having "inherited" the imperium of Central and Western Europe from the losers of said wars.

88_5	CAR_4c34356209530c13cc1da01f7173aff52cdf46ed	Focusing on the  Ottoman Empire , Mardin develops many hypotheses about the societal structure of Ottomans. For instance, he argues that in the Ottoman Empire, there was no ' civil society ' in the  Hegelian  terms that could operate independently of central government and was based on property rights. Therefore, the lack of civil society led to a difference in the social evolution and political culture in Ottoman society in contrast to Western societies. Mardin applies the terms center and periphery to the Ottoman society, and reaches the conclusion that the society consisted of city dwellers, including the Sultan and his officials and  nomads . The center included city dwellers, and the periphery nomads. The integration of center and periphery was not achieved. These two societal characteristics, namely the existence of center and periphery, and the lack of successful integration of them, also existed in the modern Turkish society and remained to be the major duality in Turkey. Mardin also emphasized the importance of  Jon Turks ' thought, addressing the attention of the English-speaking world. He analysed the thought of  Said Nursi , who was part of this movement in the early years of his life.

Agricultural slavery, such as that which was widespread in the Americas, was relatively rare. Unlike systems of  chattel slavery , slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, but maintained basic, though limited, rights. This gave them a degree of protection against abuse. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908. During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice. Policies developed by various Sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the  slave trade  but, since slavery did have centuries of religious backing and sanction, they never directly abolished the institution outright.

Although the artistic style of the Anatolian beyliks can be considered as representatives of a transition period between  Seljuks  and Ottomans, new trends were also acquired. Especially wandering traditional crafts artists and architects helped spread these new trends and localized styles to several beyliks across Anatolia, which resulted in innovative and original works particularly in architectur]. Wood and stone carving, clay tiles and other similar decorative arts of the Seljuqs were still used, however with the influence of the pursuit for new spaces and its reflections in other arts as well.

The main reason for this was Safavids’ introduction of Shiism into Persia, done to distinguish themselves from their Sunni neighbors, especially Ottomans. After 1500, the Persian culture developed distinct features of its own, and interposition of strong  Shiite  culture hampered exchanges with Sunni peoples on Persia's western and eastern frontiers. The  Sunni  peoples of eastern Mediterranean in Asia Minor, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Sunnis of Central Asia and India developed somewhat independently. Ottoman Turkey grew more like its Arab Muslim neighbors in West Asia; India developed a South Asian style of Indo-Persian culture; and Central Asia, which gradually grew more isolated, changed relatively little.

In Ottoman-occupied Greece  tax resistance  became a form of patriotism, and sometimes a condition for survival. Property and commercial tax systems were left in shambles. Greece became independent in 1822, but the corruption in modern Greece and the resistance to pay taxes to  Ottoman Empire  Era is connected by the fact that part of the ethnic Greek officials of the Ottoman empire kept their positions after Greek independence and established the way the Greek state was run. Immediately after independence, Greeks were subjected to a heavy tax burden caused by the debt accumulated during the independence war, which was combined with the poverty and devastation caused by the war. Tax evasion was, however, a larger problem among the high ranking officials, which were accustomed to being unchecked by the Ottomans and sought to preserve that status in the Greek state.

Hundreds of imperial artistic societies (called the اهل حرف Ehl-i Hiref, "Community of the Talented") were administered at the Imperial seat, the  Topkapı Palace . After an apprenticeship, artists and craftsmen could advance in rank within their field and were paid commensurate wages in quarterly annual installments. Payroll registers that survive testify to the breadth of Suleiman's patronage of the arts, the earliest of documents dating from 1526 list 40 societies with over 600 members. The Ehl-i Hiref attracted the empire's most talented artisans to the Sultan's court, both from the Islamic world and from the recently conquered territories in Europe, resulting in a blend of Arabic, Turkish and European cultures. Artisans in service of the court included painters, book binders, furriers, jewellers and goldsmiths. Whereas previous rulers had been influenced by  Persian culture  (Suleiman's father, Selim I, wrote poetry in Persian), Suleiman's patronage of the arts saw the Ottoman Empire assert its own artistic legacy.

The social system was organized around  millet . Millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity to non-Muslim populations across the  subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire  and at the same time it permitted their incorporation into the Ottoman administrative, economic and political system. The Ottoman-appointed governor collected taxes and provided security, while the local religious or cultural matters were left to the regional communities to decide. On the other hand, the sultans were Muslims and the laws that bound them were based on the  Sharia , the body of  Islam ic law, as well as various cultural customs. The Sultan, beginning in 1516, was also a  Caliph , the leader of all the  Sunni   Muslims  in the world. By the turn of the 19th century the Ottoman ruling elite recognized the need to restructure the legislative, military and judiciary systems to cope with their new political rivals in Europe.

The Ottoman Muslims had a strict hierarchy of  ulama , with the  Sheikh ul-Islam  holding the highest rank. A Sheikh ul-Islam was chosen by a royal warrant among the qadis of important cities.

Although populations across this vast region had conflicting allegiances (sectarian, locality, tribal, and ethnic affiliation) and spoke many different languages (mostly  Indo-Iranian languages  like  Persian ,  Urdu ,  Hindi ,  Punjabi ,  Pushtu ,  Baluchi , or  Kurdish , or  Turkic languages  like  Turkish ,  Azeri ,  Turkmen ,  Uzbek , or  Kyrgyz ), people shared a number of common institutions, arts, knowledge, customs, and rituals. These cultural similarities were perpetuated by poets, artists, architects, artisans, jurists, and scholars, who maintained relations among their peers in the far-flung cities of the Turko-Persian world, from  Istanbul  to  Delhi .

During the Armenian genocide, at least 60,000 youth were transferred to many different locations. Children were taken from their homes and transferred to poorly supplied camps where they would be sold. Some children were sold to central Anatolia to wealthy households for education and assimilation into the Turkish culture. Other children were sold to Muslim villagers who would then receive a stipend each month for raising them. In these instances, the displaced children had typically better lives than what they would have had with Armenian parents. Not all went to these types of homes. Some youth were sold for circumstances of exploitation and unpaid hard labor. Other youth were sent to homes in which they experienced physical and sexual abuse. Some young people were placed in homes of the people who were responsible for their parents' deaths. No matter what type of home they were sent to, the transfer of children involved the stripping of their culture identity. Their Armenian culture was erased by being raised in non-Armenian households; the Turkish government was carrying out a cultural genocide.
88_5	CAR_97e65f80ca849d1f03160ab671cf3f4c43ca9012	The Ottoman Empire had a social system based on religious affiliation. The religious insignia extended to every social function. It was common to wear clothing that identified the person with their own particular religious grouping and accompanied headgear which distinguished rank and profession throughout the Ottoman Empire. The  turban s,  fez es,  bonnet s and head-dresses surmounting Ottoman styles showed the sex, rank, and profession (both civil and military) of the wearer. These styles were accompanied with a strict regulation beginning with the reign of  Süleyman the Magnificent . Sultan Mahmud II followed on the example of  Peter the Great  in  Russia  in modernizing the Empire and used the dress code of 1826 which developed the symbols (classifications) of  feudalism  among the public. These reforms like that of  Peter I of Russia  or  Sultan Mahmud II , was achieved through introduction of the progressive customs by decrees, while banning the traditional customs. The view of their social change proposed; if the permanence of secularism was to be assured by removal of persistence of traditional cultural values (the religious insignia), a considerable degree of cultural receptivity by the public to the further social change could be achieved. The dress code gave a chance for the removal of persistence of traditional values in the society.

However, for centuries to come the official language in Turkish-speaking area's would remain Persian. In Anatolia, with the advent of the Seljuks, the practise and usage of Persian in the region would be strongly revived. A branch of the  Seljuks , the  Sultanate of Rum , took Persian language, art and letters to Anatolia. They adopted Persian language as the  official language  of the empire. The  Ottomans , which can "roughly" be seen as their eventual successors, took this tradition over. Persian was the official court language of the empire, and for some time, the official language of the empire, though the lingua franca amongst common people from the 15th/16th century would become Turkish as well as having laid an active "foundation" for the Turkic language as early as the 11th century (see  Turkification ). After a period of several centuries,  Ottoman Turkish  (which was highly Arabo-Persianised itself) had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature, which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation. However, the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%. However, Turkish was proclaimed the official language of the  Karamanids  in the 13th century, though it didn't manage to become the official language in a wider area or larger empire until the advent of the Ottomans. With the establishment of the  Ottoman Empire ,  Ottoman Turkish  (a highly Arabo-Persianised version of Oghuz Turkic) grew in importance in both poetry and prose becoming, by the beginning of the 18th century, the official language of the Empire. Unlike India, where Persian remained the official and principal literary language of both Muslim and Hindu states until the 19th century.

However, while the Jews were not viewed in the eyes of the law to be on an equal playing field with Muslims, they were still treated relatively well at points during the Ottoman Empire. Norman Stillman explains that the prosperity of medieval Jews was closely tied to that of their Muslim governors. Stillman notes that, during the time between the 9th and 13th centuries when Jewish culture blossomed, "medieval Islamic civilization was at its apogee". Given their rampant persecution in medieval Europe, many Jews looked favorably upon millet.

The  Byzantine-Ottoman wars  and the  Ottoman wars in Europe  brought large numbers of Christian slaves into the  Ottoman Empire . In the middle of the 14th century,  Murad I  built his own personal slave army called the Kapıkulu. The new force was based on the sultan's right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include captives taken in battle. The captive slaves were converted to  Islam  and trained in the sultan's personal service. 
88_5	CAR_b97f752b071624c8e0ebaea1b4343c89d777be94	Ottomanism was a form of  nationalism , likely inspired and created as a reaction to European ideas of nationalism and the growing Western involvement in the Ottoman Empire. Following the  Tanzimat  reforms, Ottomanism developed of of a need to bring the Empire together. The Ottomans feared the growing threat the Europeans posed, especially after events like the  Treaty of Balta Liman  that allowed for British merchants in the Empire to be taxed equally to the locals, and the growing concern of the Great Powers over the treatment of Christians and Jews within the Empire. The Ottomans thought that if they could unite the Empire fully under one state entity, then they would be stronger and the Europeans would have a harder time encroaching on Ottoman territory, as well as Ottoman people. Previously, the empire was vastly split into many small communities that mostly governed themselves. The Sultan oversaw these communities, however most adhered to their own laws and beliefs. This was a reason the  Ancien Regime  Ottoman Empire was so successful, because the Sultan didn't force any major changes on populations as he conquered them. Though because of nationalism, the rise of nation-states with shared senses of identities began to rise in Europe, most notably with the  Greek War of Independence  which also started affecting the Ottoman Empire. From these instances Ottomanism was developed as a social and political response, and a hope to help save the Empire from its downfall.

Young Ottomans sought to transform Ottoman society by preserving the empire and modernizing along the European tradition of adopting a constitutional government. Though the Young Ottomans were frequently in disagreement ideologically, they all agreed that the new constitutional government should continue to be somewhat rooted in  Islam  to emphasize "the continuing and essential validity of Islam as the basis of Ottoman political culture." The Young Ottomans sought to revitalize the empire by incorporating certain Europeans models of government, while still retaining the Islamic foundations the empire was founded on.  Among the prominent members of this society were writers and publicists such as  İbrahim Şinasi ,  Namık Kemal ,  Ali Suavi ,  Ziya Pasha , and  Agah Efendi .

The diffusion of Persian literature and culture in Albania is closely linked with the presence of Ottoman Empire in Albania and with the heavy influence Persian culture exerted on the Ottoman administration and Turkish culture of the era. Another key factor in the popularisation of Persian culture among Albanians is the expansion of Islam in the territories lived in by Albanians during the 16th and 17th centuries. Meanwhile, during the 19th century, the Persian language was widely used among Albanian intellectuals.

There was a strong influence from the customs and languages of  Islamic  societies, Turkish "the official language for the Empire, notably  Arab ic because of the origins of Islam, while  Persian  culture had a significant contribution through the heavily  Persianized   Seljuq Turks , the Ottomans' predecessors. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the  Sultanate of Rum  and the  Seljuk Empire , were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits and customs, and therefore, the empire has been described as a  Persianate  empire." Throughout its history, the Ottoman Empire had substantial subject populations of  Byzantine Greek s,  Armenian s,  Jews  and  Assyrians , who were allowed a certain amount of autonomy under the  confessional   millet  system of Ottoman government, and whose distinctive cultures enriched that of the Ottoman state.

Many such words were exported to other languages of the empire, such as  Albanian ,  Bulgarian ,  Serbian ,  Greek ,  Hungarian  and  Ladino . After the empire fell after  World War I  and the  Republic of Turkey  was founded, the Turkish language underwent an extensive  language reform  led by the newly founded  Turkish Language Association , during which  many adopted words  were replaced with new formations derived from  Turkic  roots.

88_5	CAR_d9712f7420938572aa71de343e0bc5e7ec9837c0	Interactions between Ottomans and Britons occurred throughout history, but in the 18th century, European visitors and residents in the Ottoman Empire markedly increased, and exploded in the 19th century. As such, fashion is one method to gauge the increased interactions. Historically, Europeans clothing was more delineated between male and female dress. Hose and trousers were reserved for men, and skirts were for women. Conversely, in the Ottoman Empire, male and female dress was more similar. A common item worn by both was the şalvar, a voluminous undergarment in white fabric shaped like what are today called “harem pants". To British women traveling in the Ottoman Empire, the şalvar quickly became a symbol of freedom because they observed that Ottoman women had more rights than British women did. Lady Mary Wortley Montague (1689-1762), whose husband was the British Ambassador to Istanbul, noted in her travels in her “Embassy Letters” that Ottoman women “possessed legal property rights and protections that far surpassed the rights of Western women”. These female travelers often gained an intimate view of Ottoman culture, since as women, they had easier access to the Muslim Elite harems than did men. Şalvar successfully spread into Europe at the end of the 19th century as various female suffragists and feminists used şalvar as a symbol of emancipation. Other British women of distinction, such as Lady (Janey) Archibal Campbell (1845-1923), and Lady Ottoline (Violet Anne) Morrell (1873-1938) wore şalvar “in an attempt to symbolize their refusal of traditional British standards and sexual differences”. Şalvar also spread beyond Europe when Amelia Jenks Bloomer modified these “Turkish trousers” to create American “bloomers”. 	Another area where the Ottomans influenced female Western dress was in layering. Initially, layering had a practical use for the ancestors of the Ottoman Empire, who were pastoral nomads and horse riders, and needed to wear layers to adapt to changing temperatures. But as the Ottoman Empire came into being, the layering of garments would distinguish one’s gender, class, or rank within particular communities, while also displaying many sumptuous fabrics, thus signaling one’s wealth and status. Layering also had spiritual significance. For instance, in Islamic art, layering different patterns represents a spiritual metaphor of the divine order that seems to be incomprehensible, but is actually planned and meaningful

Each millet had an internal system of governance based upon its religious law, such as  Sharia ,  Catholic   Canon law , or  Jewish   Halakha . The Ottoman Empire tried to modernize the code with the reforms of 1839  Hatt-i Sharif  which tried to end the confusion in the judicial sphere by extending the legal equality to all citizens.
88_5	CAR_dbe6314f5c5a4d8b51af6b90bd5e0a6f6b5cbaaf	This reformation of the Ottoman legal system is attributed to the growing presence of Western ideology within Ottoman society. Critical areas of progressive law reform such as liberalism, constitutionality, and rule of law were all characteristics of the European system and began taking effect within the sectors of law that made up the Ottoman legal system. This ideology began to overtake  Sharia  law in fields such as  commercial law ,  procedural law , and  penal law  and through these paths eventually into  family law . Areas of life such as inheritance, marriage, divorce, and child custody were undergoing progressive transformation as European influence continued its growth.These reforms were also put in place at the insistence of the Great Powers of Europe as well as a response to them. The Europeans had begun to chip away at the edges of the Empire, and their power was growing in the region. After the  Greek War of Independence ,  Nationalism  was on the rise in Europe, and Westerners thought they had a humanitarian duty to intervene on behalf of the Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire whom they saw as being unfairly treated. The British especially were gained more power with the  Treaty of Balta Liman  in 1838, that required the Ottomans to abolish Ottoman monopolies and allow British merchants full access to Ottoman markets, as well as taxing them equally. Overall, the Ottoman Empire was feeling the threat of the Western Powers growing influence over the Empire in general, as well as the Jews and Christians living within the Empire. The Tanzimat reforms came about as a response to this as well as from a Ottoman desire to modernize to compete with the growing European powers.

In many cases, the Ottomans allowed subject peoples including Christians of many denominations and Jews have their own communities where their own particular laws and customs were practiced as a part of the Ottoman whole; which often included separate legal codes for each territory that included the retention of many local customs and traditions.  This approach is somewhat similar to the approaches of other composite monarchies except that the Ottoman territories included a much more diverse population. The diversity of the empire was also reflected in the Ottoman ruling class.  Unlike most western European examples, the Ottoman ruling class included a wide variety of people and cultural traditions.  Entrance to the Ottoman ruling class was not exclusively by birth, but many other cultural and linguistic traditions were included.

In Albania and Montenegro, for example, local leaders paid nominal tribute to the Empire and otherwise had little contact. The  Republic of Ragusa  paid an annual tribute but otherwise was free to pursue its rivalry with the  Republic of Venice . The two Romance-speaking principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia had their own nobility, but were ruled by Greek families chosen by the Sultan. In Greece, the elite comprised clergymen and scholars, but there was scarcely any Greek aristocracy. A million or more Turks had settled in the Balkans, typically in smaller urban centers where they were garrison troops, civil servants, and craftsmen and merchants. There were also important communities of Jewish and Greek merchants. The Turks and Jews were not to be found in the countryside, so there was a very sharp social differentiation between the cities and their surrounding region in terms of language, religion and ethnicity. The Ottoman Empire collected taxes at about the 10% rate but there was no forced labor and the workers and peasants were not especially oppressed by the Empire.  The Sultan favoured and protected the Orthodox clergy, primarily as a protection against the missionary zeal of Roman Catholics.

Furthermore, numerous Bosnians played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and political history during this time. Bosnian soldiers formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of  Mohács  and  Krbava field , two decisive military victories, while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military bureaucracy to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals, generals, and grand viziers.

All three mark important facts of the Kosovar culture today. Kosovo has 2 official languages, Albanian and Serbian. Although they have strong Turkish roots in their folkloric music, the mass are not fluent in Turkish, it is only the elders in secular groups and municipalities that speak Turkish. According to the Kosovo Ministry of Education, each student must master and demonstrate their mother tongue during primary and secondary schooling in whichever language they choose (although most students take up the Albanian mother tongue). In addition the first foreign language that every student must demonstrate proficiency, is English. The influence of the Ottomans had a spill-over effect of cultural and religious identity which resulted in the construction of many religious monuments and artifacts in Kosovo. Over 90% of Kosovar-Albanians are of Islamic religion primarily due to the occupation of the Ottoman Empire. Aside from Turkish-religious-structural influences, the current Kosovar culture was also influenced by other ethnic minorities within the region constituting, but not limited to: Roma, Serb, Bosnian, Ashkali, Gorani, etc. Thus, instruments like the Kemenche and traditional dances such as Hora from the Turkish culture become a symbol of Kosovar ethnic identity.

The Ottoman Empire was an  Islamic state  in which the head of the Ottoman state held the position of the  Caliph . The social system was organized according to various systems, including the religiously-organized  Millet  system and  Shari'ah law , allowing religious ideology to be incorporated into the Ottoman administrative, economic, and political system. This way of life is today defined as  Islamism  (political Islam): "the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life". In the Second Constitutional Era, the  Ottoman Parliament  pursued largely secular policies, although techniques of religious populism and attacks on other candidates' piety still occurred between  Ottoman political parties  during  elections . These policies were stated as the reason for the  countercoup of 1909  by Islamists and absolute monarchists. The secular policies of the Ottoman parliament also factored in the  Arab Revolt  during World War I.

In time, all story-tellers became known as meddah and their stories became more and more secular. They began to imitate animals and make  innuendo s to attract the attention of the audiences. According to a scholar, this occurred "when the Mohammeddan clergy forbade any reference to the saints in the plays". As such, the performances by the meddah became theatrical acts based on  satire : their themes included heroic tales as well as occurrences of daily life; humorous anecdotes, mimicry of stereotypes and familiar people, "mockery of social mores" and criticism of officials, at times even the sultan, became the quintessence of their plays.

This picturesque, original and exceptionally popular theatre reached the  Balkans  from the Far East. Shifting slowly but surely from the Far East towards the Middle East, this type of theatre went through a transformation as it was passed along from person to person through many cultures. The  Karagoz Theatre  came to the Balkans together with the  Ottoman Empire . In the history of the Macedonian culture the name of this theatre was mentioned starting from the 11th, or at least the 14th century. A Turkish legend speaks about the origin of the construction of a large mosque in Bursa and its constructors among whom were two friends and storytellers known as  Karagöz  and  Hadzivat . Instead of working, they sat and told comical stories to the workers. Their performances were so attractive to their audience that the construction of the mosque completely stopped - the construction site instead became a theatre. When the Sultan heard what had happened he became furious and ordered the execution of the two friends. Karagoz and Hadzivat were unable to escape their fate but the citizens of Bursa were overcome by grief at the loss of the two heroes. The Sultan realized his folly and tried to correct it by ordering the revival of the two men. Unable to actually give them life, the sultan kept them alive in the form of small, transparent puppets made of thin and colored skin. If they were to be placed in front of a white curtain with a burning candle behind it, they would dance as if they were alive and the sultan had redeemed himself.

This form of performance was especially popular in the  Ottoman Empire  from the 16th century onwards. The play was generally about a single topic, the meddah playing different characters, and was usually introduced by drawing attention to the  moral  contained in the story. The meddah would use props such as an umbrella, a handkerchief, or different headwear, to signal a change of character, and was skilled at manipulating his voice and imitating different  dialects . There was no time limitation on the shows; a good meddah had the skill to adjust the story depending on interaction with the audience.

Whilst strongly based on Turkish nomadic and  shamanist  traditions brought from  Central Asia  rather than external influences, Turkish story-telling was influenced by the Arabic and Persian traditions by the 11th-13th centuries to become a form of one-man theatre. These narrators of mainly epic tales were known as  kıssahan , with their stories containing strong Islamic elements that reinforced the faith of the Muslims in the audience and attempting to convert the non-Muslims. Such kıssahan existed during the  Seljuq  period and usually told Arabic and Persian epics, stories of  Ali  and  Hamza , as well as tales from  One Thousand and One Nights . These stories expanded over time to include stories such as  Battal Gazi .

Karpat, according to whom such writings displayed the attributes of "a great storyteller" influenced by both Romanian classic  Ion Creangă  and the Ottoman  meddah s, notes that they often fail to comply with orthodox attested timelines and accuracy checks. Reviewing În închisorile turcești, journalist  D. I. Cucu  recognized Batzaria as an entertaining raconteur, but noted that the text failed to constitute a larger fresco of the Aromanian "denationalization". Cucu described the account as entirely opposed to the romanticized narratives of Ottoman affairs, by  Pierre Loti  or  Edmondo De Amicis . More such criticism came from Batzaria's  modernist  contemporary  Felix Aderca , who suggested that Batzaria and Iorga (himself an occasional writer) had "compromised for good" the notion of travel literature.

When he returned to Constantinople on 27 December 1621, he entered with a victory procession; there were three days and nights of victory celebrations. However, the young Sultan was personally very unsatisfied with the result of the battle and the behavior of his household troops, the janissaries, during the campaign and started taking measures to reform the Ottoman military. That attempt led to a revolt in Constantinople by the army, madrasa (religious school) students and wealthy merchants in May 1622, at the end of which Sultan Osman II was deposed and killed by the leaders of the mob. This revolt and the demise of the young Sultan (who was only 17 when killed) is one of the events most written about by Ottoman historians and appears often in Ottoman court literature and Ottoman popular literature. In the peoples' coffee houses in Istanbul (up to the end of the 19th century) public storytellers used to relate the tales, many in poetry form, of the exploits of Young Osman (including Khotin) and his tragic demise.

The methods of meddahs were the same as the methods of the itinerant storytellers who related Greek epics such as the  Iliad  and  Odyssey , even though the main stories were now  Ferhat ile Şirin  or  Layla and Majnun .

The quality and beauty of these stories would have made them good candidates for inclusion in The  Arabian Nights , but fate decreed otherwise. The book reveals an entire world existing side-by-side with The Arabian Nights, of novel-like pre-modern compositions that reflect a measure of  folk culture , a tradition of oral storytelling whose tales were occasionally also put to writing (whenever there are two versions of a story, they are not similar, since the narrator usually does not copy the story, but just tells it in a different way). A few noteworthy texts are replete with poetry and demonstrate quite clearly that even narrators of folktales in a sense continued the tradition of Classical Arabic poetry. Subsequently the book was published in a French edition under the title Et il y eut d'autres nuits (2004), and an Arabic edition is forthcoming. The texts claim to reflect  Abbasid  or  Mamluk  culture, but quite a few of the extant manuscripts are later, and are dated to the beginning of the  Ottoman period .

In  Umayyad  times, storytellers (qaaṣṣ, or pl. qoṣṣaaṣ) used to tell stories of Muhammad and  earlier prophets  in private gatherings and  mosques , given they obtain permission from the authorities. Many of these storytellers are now unknown. After the Umayyad period, their reputation deteriorated because of their inclination to exaggerate and fantasize, and for relying on the  Isra'iliyat . Thus they were banned from preaching at mosques. In later periods, however, works of sīra became more prominent. More recently, western historical criticism and debate concerning sīra have elicited a defensive attitude from some Muslims who wrote  apologetic  literature defending its content.

The storyteller Meddah guides the last thought of Thovma along the life paths of his father, that lead from a small idyllic mountain village into the torture chambers of the Turkish rulers, and let him become a witness of the big pogrom against the Armenians in 1915. “By means of an oriental fairy tale, and drawing from sagas and legends of this distressed nation, Hilsenrath goes far back into Armenian history and touches upon the plight of all genocide victims.

By 1300, a weakened  Byzantine Empire  had lost most of its Anatolian provinces to these Turkish principalities. One of the beyliks was led by  Osman I  (d. 1323/4), from which the name Ottoman is derived, son of  Ertuğrul , around  Eskişehir  in western Anatolia. In the foundation myth expressed in the story known as " Osman's Dream ", the young Osman was inspired to conquest by a prescient vision of empire (according to his dream, the empire is a big tree whose roots spread through three continents and whose branches cover the sky). According to his dream the tree, which was Osman's Empire, issued four rivers from its roots, the  Tigris , the  Euphrates , the  Nile  and the  Danube .  Additionally, the tree shaded four mountain ranges, the  Caucasus , the  Taurus , the  Atlas  and the  Balkan  ranges.

Although both were composed in the 12th century and draw upon a common Arabic tradition, they show significant differences, with the Turkish tale including many uniquely Turkic and Persian influences, including supernatural elements from folk tradition or motifs from the  Shahname  and the Romance of  Abu Muslim . Both romances place al-Battal in the mid-9th century and associate him with the epic cycle of Malatya and its emir,  Umar al-Aqta  (died 863), with the result that he became particularly associated with the city of Malatya and its region. In the Delhemma, his own role in the Umayyad wars with Byzantium is taken over by the  Kilabite  hero al-Sahsah. In these tales al-Battal is presented as an Islamic analogue to  Ulysses , to the extent that his name became a byword for cunning. The Turks adopted al-Battal following the  Danishmendid  conquest of Malatya in 1102, and he became prominent as a Turkish national hero and symbol of their conquest of Asia Minor. His stories (Battalname) were reworked throughout the  Seljuk  and  Ottoman  periods, and he became the subject of a considerable body of folk tales. A cult developed around him as a saintly figure (" sayyid "), especially among the  Alevi  and  Bektashi  sects, and his supposed tomb at  Seyitgazi  became a major centre of pilgrimage until the early 20th century, drawing pilgrims from as far as Central Asia.

Several older myths, dating back even to the early 16th century, already purported connections between the French and the Ottoman monarchy, but have been traced to be politically motivated fabrications, so that alliances between the respective monarchs were seen as justifiable. The Aimée-Nakşidil tale shows distinct parallels to these older tales. In times of monarchy, the stories about abducted French princesses weren't repudiated to maintain good relations - in fact, both  Napoleon III  and  Abdülaziz  were pleased to announce their kinship to each other, years later. In later times this and similar harem tales have been used to perpetuate the prejudice of Turkey, the Middle East and the Islam in general as mysterious and despotic in nature, despite more accurate accounts available. The legend furthermore reinforced prejudices of the Ottoman Empire as a backwater country, when even a western slave consort was able to initiate an overdue modernization while the primitive natives couldn't conceive necessary reforms.

However, the tradition of the meddah ended by the middle of the 20th century, with  Sururi , active until the 1930s, being considered the last representative of this form of art.

Perhaps the most popular figure in the tradition is the aforementioned  Nasreddin  (known as Nasreddin Hoca, or "teacher Nasreddin", in Turkish), who is the central character of thousands of stories of comical quality.

Karpat, according to whom such writings displayed the attributes of "a great storyteller" influenced by both Romanian classic  Ion Creangă  and the Ottoman  meddah s, notes that they often fail to comply with orthodox attested timelines and accuracy checks. Reviewing În închisorile turcești, journalist  D. I. Cucu  recognized Batzaria as an entertaining raconteur, but noted that the text failed to constitute a larger fresco of the Aromanian "denationalization". Cucu described the account as entirely opposed to the romanticized narratives of Ottoman affairs, by  Pierre Loti  or  Edmondo De Amicis . More such criticism came from Batzaria's  modernist  contemporary  Felix Aderca , who suggested that Batzaria and Iorga (himself an occasional writer) had "compromised for good" the notion of travel literature.

When he returned to Constantinople on 27 December 1621, he entered with a victory procession; there were three days and nights of victory celebrations. However, the young Sultan was personally very unsatisfied with the result of the battle and the behavior of his household troops, the janissaries, during the campaign and started taking measures to reform the Ottoman military. That attempt led to a revolt in Constantinople by the army, madrasa (religious school) students and wealthy merchants in May 1622, at the end of which Sultan Osman II was deposed and killed by the leaders of the mob. This revolt and the demise of the young Sultan (who was only 17 when killed) is one of the events most written about by Ottoman historians and appears often in Ottoman court literature and Ottoman popular literature. In the peoples' coffee houses in Istanbul (up to the end of the 19th century) public storytellers used to relate the tales, many in poetry form, of the exploits of Young Osman (including Khotin) and his tragic demise.

The methods of meddahs were the same as the methods of the itinerant storytellers who related Greek epics such as the  Iliad  and  Odyssey , even though the main stories were now  Ferhat ile Şirin  or  Layla and Majnun . The repertoires of the meddahs also included true stories, modified depending on the audience, artist and political situation.

Popular legend has it that the two characters are actually based on two real persons who worked either for  Osman I —the founder of the  Ottoman dynasty —or for his successor  Orhan I , in the construction of a palace or possibly a mosque at  Bursa  in the early 14th century. The two workers supposedly spent much of their time entertaining the other workers, and were so funny and popular that they interfered with work on the palace, and were subsequently  beheaded .

88_7	CAR_ef98ef862ddad82b9bd520dc6bc58ffd9c504156	The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a  frame story , when the outer story does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers. This concept can be found in ancient  Indian literature , such as the  epics   Mahabharata  and  Ramayana ,  Vishnu Sarma 's  Panchatantra ,  Syntipas '  Seven Wise Masters , the  Hitopadesha , and  Vikram and the Vampire . Another early example of stories within a story can be found in the  One Thousand and One Nights  (Arabian Nights), which can be traced back to  Arabic ,  Persian , and Indian storytelling traditions.  Homer 's  Odyssey  too makes use of this device;  Odysseus ' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king  Alcinous  in  Scheria . Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the Odyssey.

The performances take place in public spaces amidst spectators who form a halqa (circle) around the storyteller. They consist of storytelling of daily life or historical events by a narrator. The narrator chooses a subject which is usually historical or religious and starts improvising praise mainly using colloquial Arabic. The script is unfinished and full of holes which gives freedom to the actor to improvise. The performance often depends on the virtuosity of a single person which performs various roles. Storytellers include dramatic elements such as dancing and singing. During French occupation in the region, storytellers had such a success that some were censored by authorities. Pioneers of this genre of popular theatre in Algeria are  Abdelkader Alloula  and Rachid Ksentini. In Morocco,  Mohammed Kaghat  is seen as one of the best representatives of the Moroccan murtajala, a subversive, comic and ironic improvised representation of theatre practices. In Tunisia, an Experimental Theatre Festival has taken place in  Medenine  since 1992.

An administrative structure which distinguished the communities based on religion and ethnicity, each group was treated as a distinct entity. With the  Orthodox Church  playing a dominant position among the  Greek Cypriots  so as to help them preserve their ethnic, cultural, and political identity, religious activities and institutions factored into virtually every facet of the Cypriot community. Through the imposition of taxation and other various administrative tasks on a denominational basis, the millet system served as a central contributor in the creation of "political cleavage over ethnic lines.

People were able to represent themselves more effectively as a group than as individuals.

At its peak in the 16th and 17th century, the empire controlled much of  Southeast Europe ,  Western Asia , the  Caucasus ,  North Africa , and the  Horn of Africa . In addition to Turks, ethnic groups included  Albanians ,  Armenians ,  Arabs ,  Assyrians ,  Bosnians ,  Bulgarians ,  Circassians ,  Georgians ,  Greeks ,  Jews ,  Laz ,  Kurds ,  Zazas ,  Macedonians ,  Romanians ,  Serbs  and  Tatars .  Millet  was a separate legal court pertaining to "personal law" under which a  confessional community  (Muslim  Sharia , Christian  Canon law  or Jewish  Halakha  law abiding) was allowed to rule itself under its own system. After the Ottoman  Tanzimat  (1839–76) reforms, the term was used for legally protected religious  minority group s, similar to the way other countries use the word nation. The word Millet comes from the  Arabic  word millah (ملة) and literally means "nation". The millet system has been called an example of pre-modern  religious pluralism .

The Patriarchate earned a primary importance and occupied this key role among the Christians of the Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion, and thus regarded all the  Orthodox Christians  of the Empire as a single entity.

This change was also meant to increase the legitimacy of Ottoman rule. Another major hope was that by being more open to various demographics, more people would be attracted into the empire. There was fear of internal strife between Muslims and non-Muslims, and allowing more religious freedom to all was supposed to diminish this threat. Giving more rights to the Christians was considered likely to reduce the danger of outside intervention on their behalf.
88_8	CAR_22a02abd346e13531fea8fce7043e127b87f1649	Bulgarian Millet or Bulgar Millet was an ethno-religious and linguistic community within the  Ottoman Empire  from the mid-19th to early 20th century. Initially the Millet were recognized as the  Bulgarian Uniates , and then the  Bulgarian Orthodox Christians  (Eksarhhâne-i Millet i Bulgar). At that time the classical Ottoman  Millet -system began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with ethnic identity and the term millet was used as a synonym of nation. In this way, in the struggle for recognition of a separate Church, the modern Bulgarian nation was created. The establishment of the  Bulgarian Exarchate  in 1870, meant in practice recognition of a separate Bulgarian nationality, and in this case the religious affiliation became a consequence of national allegiance. The founding of an independent church, along with the revival of Bulgarian language and education, were the crucial factors that strengthened the national consciousness and revolutionary struggle, that led to the creation of an independent nation-state in 1878.

Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority. Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local  millet . The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups. The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the "trade court". The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative Qanun, i.e. laws, a system based upon the Turkic  Yassa  and  Töre , which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.

After the Ottoman  Tanzimat  (1839–76) reforms,  Nationalism  arose in the Empire and the term was used for legally protected religious  minority group s, similar to the way other countries use the word  nation .

The Ottoman term specifically refers to the separate legal courts pertaining to personal law under which minorities were allowed to rule themselves (in cases not involving any Muslim) with fairly little interference from the  Ottoman government . The concept was used even before the establishment of the Ottoman Empire for the communities of the  Church of the East  under the  Zoroastrian   Sassanid Persia  in the 4th century.

The social system was organized around the  millet  structure. The millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity across the society but at the same time permitted the religious ideology to be incorporated into the administrative, economic and political system.

For this purpose, Mehmed II also founded previously non-existent religious authorities such as the  Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople  in 1461. Earlier, the Byzantines considered the Armenian Church as  heretic  and did not allow the Armenians to have churches inside the  walls of Constantinople . Several Armenian saints, such as  Saint Narses , were exiled and imprisoned in the  Princes' Islands  near Constantinople, in the  Sea of Marmara . With the Millet System, a great deal of the internal affairs regarding these communities were assigned to the administration of these religious authorities; such as the  Ecumenical Patriarchate  for the affairs of all Orthodox Christians, the Armenian Patriarchate for the affairs of the Armenian (and for some time also the Syriac) Christians, and later the Chief Rabbi for the affairs of the Jews.
88_8	CAR_2caebb513a4c7f738ad7eb5f85375c510590c9de	Devşirme  (blood tax) was one of the organized practices by which the Ottomans took boys from their Christian families, who were later converted to Islam with the aim of selecting and training the ablest of them for leading positions in the Ottoman society. As a rule , the  Ottomans  did not require the Greeks to become  Muslim s, although a minority did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule, take advantage of greater employment prospects and possibilities of advancement in the Ottoman government bureaucracy and military. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the  millet system , which was closely linked to  Islam ic religious rules. At that time people were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their  confessional communities ), rather than to their ethnic origins. Muslim communities prospered under the Ottoman Empire, and the Ottoman law did not recognize such notions as  ethnicity  and the Muslims of any ethnic background enjoyed precisely the same rights and privileges. Another major reason for converting to Islam was the well-organized taxation system based on religion. Major taxes were the  Defter  and  İspençe  and the more severe  haraç  whereby a document was issued which stated that "the holder of this certificate is able to keep his head on the shoulders since he paid the Χαράτσι tax for this year ...". All these of course were waived if the person would convert and become Muslim,. During the  Greek War of Independence , Ottoman Egyptian troops under the leadership of  Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt  ravaged the island of Crete and the Greek countryside of the  Morea  where the Muslim Egyptian soldiers enslaved vast numbers of Christian Greek children and women. Ibrahim arranged for the enslaved Greek children to be forcefully converted to Islam en masse. The enslaved Greeks were subsequently transferred to  Egypt  where they were sold as slaves. Several decades later in 1843, the English traveler and writer  Sir John Gardner Wilkinson  described the state of enslaved Greeks who had converted to Islam in Egypt:

Ottoman rule was long, lasting from the 14th century up until the early 20th in some territories. The Ottoman Empire was religiously, linguistically and ethnically diverse, and a much more tolerant place for religious practices when compared to other parts of the world at the time. The different groups in the empire were organised along confessional lines, in the so-called the  Millet system . Among the  Orthodox  Christians of the empire (the  Rum Millet ) a common identity was forged based on a shared sense of time defined by the ecclesiastical calendar, saint's days and feasts.

In tax registries, the Orthodox Christians were recorded as "infidels" (see  giaour ). Since the time of  Austro-Turkish war (1683-1699)  relations between Muslims and Orthodox Christians in European provinces of Ottoman Empire were radicalized, gradually taking more extreme forms and resulting in occasional calls of Muslim religious leaders for expulsion or extermination of local Christians, and also Jews. As a result of Turkish oppression, destruction of Churches and Monasteries and violence against non-Muslim civilian population,  Serbian  Christians and their church leaders headed by Serbian Patriarch  Arsenije III  sided with Austrians in 1689 and again in 1737 under Serbian Patriarch  Arsenije IV .

The rise of nationalism in Europe under the influence of the  French revolution  had extended to the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century.

The head of a millet – most often a religious hierarch such as the Greek Orthodox  Patriarch of Constantinople  or, in earlier times, the  Patriarch of the East  – reported directly to the  Ottoman Sultan  or the Sassanid king, respectively. The millets had a great deal of power – they set their own laws and collected and distributed their own taxes. All that was required was loyalty to the Empire. When a member of one millet committed a crime against a member of another, the law of the injured party applied, but the ruling Islamic majority being paramount, any dispute involving a Muslim fell under their  sharia −based law.

The social system was organized around  millet . Millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity to non-Muslim populations across the  subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire  and at the same time it permitted their incorporation into the Ottoman administrative, economic and political system. The Ottoman-appointed governor collected taxes and provided security, while the local religious or cultural matters were left to the regional communities to decide. On the other hand, the sultans were Muslims and the laws that bound them were based on the  Sharia , the body of  Islam ic law, as well as various cultural customs. The Sultan, beginning in 1516, was also a  Caliph , the leader of all the  Sunni   Muslims  in the world. By the turn of the 19th century the Ottoman ruling elite recognized the need to restructure the legislative, military and judiciary systems to cope with their new political rivals in Europe.

The Ottoman Muslims had a strict hierarchy of  ulama , with the  Sheikh ul-Islam  holding the highest rank. A Sheikh ul-Islam was chosen by a royal warrant among the qadis of important cities.

The millet system in the  Ottoman Empire  granted a number of important civil and judicial functions to the Patriarch of Constantinople and the diocesan metropolitans. As the higher Bulgarian church clerics were replaced by Greek ones at the beginning of the Ottoman domination, the Bulgarian population was subjected to double oppressionpolitical by the Ottomans and cultural by the Greek clergy.  With the rise of Greek nationalism in the second half of the 18th century, the clergy imposed the  Greek language  and a Greek consciousness on the emerging Bulgarian bourgeoisie.  The Patriarchate of Constantinople became its tool to assimilate other peoples.  At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the clergy opened numerous schools with all-round  Greek language  curriculum and nearly banned the Bulgarian liturgy.  These actions threatened the survival of the Bulgarians as a separate nation and people with its own, distinct national culture.

The Orthodox millet, for instance, was still officially legally subject to  Justinian's Code , which had been in effect in the Byzantine Empire for 900 years. Also, as the largest group of non-Muslim subjects (or  zimmi ) of the Islamic Ottoman state, the Orthodox millet was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce, and had to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects.

The position of educated and privileged Christians within the Ottoman Empire improved in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the Ottomans increasingly recognized the missing skills which the larger Ottoman population lacked, and as the empire became more settled it began to feel its increasing backwardness in relation to the European powers. European powers on the other side, engaged in a power struggle to safeguard their militaristic, strategic and commercial interests in the Empire, this gave motivation to the powers to help people in need. The  rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire  as a direct result of enlightenment of Christian millets through education, was the dominant theme.

This system reinforced the position of the  Orthodox Church  and the cohesion of the ethnic Greek population. Gradually the  Archbishop of Cyprus  became not only religious but ethnic leader as well, something the Ottoman Turks promoted, wanting to have somebody responsible for the loyalty of the Greek flock. In this way the Church undertook the task of the guardian of the Greek cultural legacy, although diminished since the country's independence.

Despite frequently being referred to as a "system", before the nineteenth century the organization of what are now retrospectively called millets in the Ottoman Empire was far from systematic. Rather, non-Muslims were simply given a significant degree of autonomy within their own community, without an overarching structure for the 'millet' as a whole. The notion of distinct millets corresponding to different religious communities within the empire would not emerge until the eighteenth century. Subsequently, the existence of the millet system was justified through numerous foundation myths linking it back to the time of Sultan  Mehmed II  (r. 1451-81), although it is now understood that no such system existed in the fifteenth century. After the Ottoman  Tanzimat  (1839–76) reforms, the term was used for legally protected religious  minority group s, similar to the way other countries use the word nation.

The sultans enhanced the temporal powers of the Greek orthodox hierarchy that came to be politically beholden solely to the Ottoman sultan and, along with other  Ottoman Greek   nobles , came to run the Balkan Orthodox domains of the Ottoman Empire. As a result, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became isolated from the rest of Christendom.

For example, in a town a church should not be larger in size than the largest mosque. Some churches were destroyed (e.g. the  Church of the Holy Apostles ), many were converted into mosques (among them the  Hagia Sophia  and  Chora Church  in  Constantinople , the  Rotunda  and  Hagios Demetrios  in  Thessaloniki ) or served for other uses (e.g.  Hagia Irene  in Constantinople, which became an armory for the Janissaries, and the  Gül Mosque  (Hagia Theodosia or Christ Euergetes), also in Constantinople, which after the Conquest served for a while as a naval dockyard). Must also be pointed out that such rules, very strict in the beginning, with time and the increasing importance reached in the Ottoman Empire by the  Rûm   Millet , were more and more disregarded, so that in the 19th century in Istanbul there was a veritable building boom of Orthodox churches, many among them having high bell towers and brick domes, which previously were both strictly prohibited.

The goal of the program was to, “promote reform, fend off the powers and forestall rebellion”. The Council of the Tanzimat was established to codify the actions enacted by the Tanzimat reforms.  These reforms were designed to centralize power through “modernization [and] centralization” to “increase revenue [and] prevent fragmentation”   It was enacted on November 3, 1839 through an imperial decree given by Mustafa Reşid Pasa called the “Rose Chamber Edict.” This period demonstrated the Empire’s increased efforts towards Westernization and acceptance by the  Concert of Europe , as well, as Western schools were opened to train bureaucrats for future governmental positions.  Councils of State, Justice, and Education were all established, as well as provincial councils to represent all religious and social groups residing in the Empire.  Fuad hoped that the Tanzimat reforms would, “find salvation for the empire by creating among its peoples the bond of equal citizenship based on Ottoman nationality”  He realized the importance of change and saw it as a necessary evolution that the Ottoman Empire needed to make. However, in his efforts to create an image of a modern Ottoman Empire, Fuad Pasha believed that by giving non- Muslim  subjects of the Empire equal rights via the  Millet  system would “dull their nationalist and separatist tendencies.” He, along with the other three reformers, believed that in order to save the empire, a sense of “Ottomanism” needed to be created.   The goal was to create an “Ottoman” nation and unify the Jews, Christians, and Muslims into an Ottoman nationality.  The Council of the Tanzimat took complete charge of preparing legislation, and because both Fuad and Ali wanted immediate progress, the Council was made separate from the ministries and the chairman was “given direct access to the sultan, ”  which represented increasing efforts towards centralization.  The old Supreme Council, however, still remained an influential factor as its existence and functions, though de jure limited to judicial matters, caused much confusion.

Like the  Greek Orthodox  and  Jewish  minorities of the  Ottoman Empire , they constituted a distinct  millet , led by the  Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople . Under this system, Christians and Jews were considered  religious minorities / second-class citizens ; they were subjected to elevated taxation, but in return they were granted autonomy within their own religious communities and were exempted from military service. Growing religious and political influence from neighboring communities necessitated implementation of security measures that often required a longer waiting period for minorities to seek  legal recourse  in the courts.

In the framework of the millet they had a considerable amount of administrative  autonomy  and were represented by the  Hakham Bashi , the Chief Rabbi. There were no restrictions in the professions Jews could practice analogous to those common in Western Christian countries.  There were restrictions in the areas Jews could live or work, as there were on Ottoman subjects of other religions.

Tanzimat  reforms aimed to encourage  Ottomanism  among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into the Ottoman society with new laws and regulations. With the  Tanzimat  era the regulation called " Regulation of the Armenian Nation " (Turkish: "Nizâmnâme−i Millet−i Ermeniyân") was introduced on 29 March 1863, over the Millet organization, which granted extensive privileges and autonomy concerning self−governance. The Armenian Nation, "Millet−i Ermeniyân", which is considered here, is the  Armenian Orthodox Gregorian  nation (millet) of that time. In a very short time, the Ottoman Empire passed another regulation over "Nizâmnâme−i Millet−i Ermeniyân" developed by the Patriarchate Assemblies of Armenians, which was named as the  Islahat Fermânı  (Firman of the Reforms).  The "Firman of the Reforms" gave immense privileges to the Armenians, which formed a "governance in governance" to eliminate the  aristocratic dominance  of the Armenian  nobles  by development of the political strata in the society.

Thus,  Orthodox Judaism  is officially recognised in Israel, while  Reform Rabbis  and  Conservative Rabbis  are not recognised and cannot perform marriages.

The Patriarchate earned a primary importance and occupied this key role among the Christians of the Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion, and thus regarded all the  Orthodox Christians  of the Empire as a single entity.

During the nineteenth century, modern national consciousness began to increase among the south Slavs; some historians now believe that it was in this period that Catholic Bosnians increasingly began to think of themselves as Croats, and Orthodox Bosnians as Serbs. The beginnings of a Muslim Bosnian national consciousness is also first attested in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as these early Bosniak nationalists began to assert a national identity distinct from both their Orthodox and Catholic neighbors, and from the other Muslim inhabitants of the empire. Most Serb and Croat nationalists tend to deny a separate Bosniak national identity, claiming that Bosniaks were either Serb or Croat in origin, but of Islamic religion. This debate, whether Bosnia and the Bosniaks are "really" Croats, Serbs, or a separate Bosniak Bosnian nation, has energized debates among nationalists until the present day. Anthropologists find the nationalist statements on Serbian or Croatian origin rather irrational and ultimately undignified attention, since, with a few notable exceptions, the ethnicity and history of the dominated in communist and monarchy Yugoslavia has been prescribed by the dominators and by the general demographics of a region.

Initially the Millet were recognized as the  Bulgarian Uniates , and then the  Bulgarian Orthodox Christians  (Eksarhhâne-i Millet i Bulgar). At that time the classical Ottoman  Millet -system began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with ethnic identity and the term millet was used as a synonym of nation. In this way, in the struggle for recognition of a separate Church, the modern Bulgarian nation was created. The establishment of the  Bulgarian Exarchate  in 1870, meant in practice recognition of a separate Bulgarian nationality, and in this case the religious affiliation became a consequence of national allegiance. The founding of an independent church, along with the revival of Bulgarian language and education, were the crucial factors that strengthened the national consciousness and revolutionary struggle, that led to the creation of an independent nation-state in 1878.

This is evident in the first article of the Convention which states: "As from 1st May, 1923, there shall take place a compulsory exchange of Turkish nationals of the Greek Orthodox Religion established in Turkish territory, and of Greek nationals of the Moslem religion established in Greek territory." The agreement defined the groups subject to exchange as  Muslim  and  Greek Orthodox . This classification follows the lines drawn by the  millet system  of the Ottoman Empire. In the absence of rigid national definitions, there was no readily available criteria to yield to an official ordering of identities after centuries long coexistence in a non-national order.

It referred to the separate legal courts pertaining to "personal law" under which religious communities were allowed to rule themselves under their own system. The Sultan regarded the  Ecumenical Patriarch  of the  Constantinople Patriarchate  as the leader of the Orthodox Christian peoples of his empire. After the Ottoman  Tanzimat  (1839–76) reforms,  Nationalism  arose in the Empire and the term was used for legally protected religious  minority group s, similar to the way other countries use the word  nation . New millets were created in 1860 and 1870 for  Uniate  and  Orthodox  Bulgarian Christian communities. In this way a separate Bulgarian diocese was established, based on  ethnic identity  rather than principles of Orthodoxy and territory. 
88_10	CAR_28a08ef9653535f8dcca10e49efae40509252ac8	In the early 19th century, the Greek Orthodox intellectuals tried to reconceptualize the Rum millet. They argued for a new, ethnic "Romaic" national identity and new Byzantine state, but their visions of a future state included all Balkan Orthodox Christians. This  Megali Idea  implied the goal of reviving the Eastern Roman Empire by establishing a new Greek state. It spread among the urban population of Vlach, Slavic and Albanian origin and it started to view itself increasingly as Greek. On the other hand, the Ottoman  Tanzimat  reforms in the middle of the 19th century were aimed to encourage  Ottomanism  among the secessionist subject nations and stop the nationalist movements within the Empire, but failed to succeed. With the  rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire , the Rum millet began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with ethnic nationality. The national awakening of each ethnic group inside it was complex and most of the groups interacted with each other. The  Bulgarian Exarchate  recognized by the Ottomans in 1870 was only a link in a series of events following the unilateral declaration of an autocephalous Orthodox Church of Greece in 1833 and of Romania in 1865. The 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War dealt a decisive blow to Ottoman power in the Balkan Peninsula. The Serbian Orthodox Church also became autocephalous in 1879. The Albanians' fear that the lands they inhabited would be partitioned among neighbouring Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece fueled the rise of Albanian nationalism and the  League of Prizren  was founded. The recognition of Vlachs as a distinct millet in the Ottoman Empire in 1905 was the final straw in this Balkan nationalistic competition. As a result, intense ethnic and national rivalries among the Balkan peoples emerged at the eve of the 20th century in Macedonia. That was followed by a series of conflicts among Greeks ( Grecomans ), Serbs ( Serbomans ), Bulgarians ( Bulgarophiles ) and Vlachs (Rumanophiles) in the region. The  Young Turk Revolution  of 1908 restored the Parliament, which had been suspended by the Sultan in 1878. However, the process of supplanting the monarchic institutions was unsuccessful and the European periphery of the Empire continued to splinter under the pressures of local revolts. Subsequently, with the Balkan Wars, the Ottoman Empire lost virtually all of its possessions in the Balkans, which put a de facto end to the community of the Rum millet.

The social system was organized around the  millet  structure. The millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity across the society but at the same time permitted the religious ideology to be incorporated into the administrative, economic and political system. One can define this way of life  as  Islamism  (Political Islam): "the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life".

Ottoman rule was long, lasting from the 14th century up until the early 20th in some territories. The Ottoman Empire was religiously, linguistically and ethnically diverse, and a much more tolerant place for religious practices when compared to other parts of the world at the time. The different groups in the empire were organised along confessional lines, in the so-called the  Millet system . Among the  Orthodox  Christians of the empire (the  Rum Millet ) a common identity was forged based on a shared sense of time defined by the ecclesiastical calendar, saint's days and feasts.

The Bulgarian Slavs, wanted to create their own schools in a common modern literary standard. By the middle of the century, Bulgarian activists shifted their attention from language to religion and started debate on the establishment of a separate Bulgarian church. As a consequence, until the 1870s, the focus of the  Bulgarian National Revival  switched to the struggle for a Bulgarian Church, independent from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Cultural, administrative and even political independence from the Patriarchate could only be obtained through the establishment of a separate millet or  nation . The coordinated actions aimed at the recognition of a separate millet constitute the so-called "Church Struggle". The actions were carried out by Bulgarian national leaders and supported by the majority of the Slavic population in today Bulgaria, Eastern Serbia, Republic of Macedonia and Northern Greece.

With the rise of national states and their histories, it is very hard to find reliable sources on the  Ottoman  concept of a  nation  and the centuries of the relations between House of Osman and the provinces, which turned into states. Unquestionably, understanding the Ottoman conception of nationhood helps us to understand what happened in the Balkans in the late  Ottoman  period.

From the fifteenth century onward words from Ottoman Turkish entered the Albanian language. While a corpus of poets and other Muslim Albanian authors wrote in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian or in the Albanian language in Arabic script ( aljamiado ) encompassing narrative prose, poetry, reflective works on religion and socio-political situations and so on. Prominent amongst these authors were  Yahya bey Dukagjini ,  Haxhi Shehreti  or  bejtexhinj  poets like  Nezim Frakulla ,  Muhamet Kyçyku ,  Sulejman Naibi ,  Hasan Zyko Kamberi ,  Haxhi Ymer Kashari  and others. Towns and cities in Albania underwent change as they adopted Ottoman architectural and cultural elements.  Apart from Elbasan founded (1466) around a fortress, other settlements with the construction of buildings related to religion, education and social purposes like mosques, madrassas, imarets and so on by the Ottoman Muslim Albanian elite became new urban centres like Korçë, Tiranë and Kavajë. Older urban centres for example Berat attained mosques,  hamams  (Ottoman bathhouses), madrasas (Muslim religious schools), coffee houses, tekes and became known for its poets, artists and scholarly pursuits. Unlike Kosovo or Macedonia, architecturally Albania's Ottoman Muslim heritage was more modest in number, though prominent structures are the  Mirahori Mosque  in Korçë (built 1495–96),  Murad Bey Mosque  in  Krujë  (1533–34),  Lead Mosque  in Shkodër (1773–74),   Et'hem Bey Mosque  in Tiranë (begun 1791–94; finished 1820–21) and others. Conversion from Christianity to Islam for Albanians also marked a transition from  Rum  (Christian) to Muslim confessional communities within the Ottoman  millet system  that collectively  divided and governed peoples according to their religion. The Ottomans were nonetheless aware of the existence of Muslim Albanians and used terms like Arnavud (اروانيد) extensively as an ethnic marker to address the shortcomings of the usual millet religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records. While the country was referred to as Arnavudluk (آرناوودلق). Also a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym. The ethnic demonym Shqiptarë, derived from Latin connoting clear speech and verbal understanding gradually replaced Arbëresh/Arbënesh amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

The equalization between religious confession and ethnicity began in the middle of the 16th century when the  Serbian Orthodox Church  (Patriarchate of Peć), which had a significant religious and political influence on Serbs, started since 1557 to identify Orthodoxy with  Serbdom . Gradually in the 17th century, as Croatian culture was preserved by the  Roman Catholic Diocese of Senj-Modruš  in Croatia, and the  Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena  in Ottoman Bosnia, the Roman Catholicism was identified the Croatian national name. The socio-cultural difference was a life-style distinction between the natives (Catholic, peasant, smaller families) and the new migrants (Orthodox, pastoralist, larger families), who referred to themselves as Vlachs in the context of claiming the traditional legal rights and privileges of their social class by the state.

The Armenian millet had a great deal of power - they set their own laws and collected and distributed their own taxes. During the  Tanzimat period , a series of constitutional reforms provided a limited modernization of the Ottoman Empire also to the Armenians.

The act also instituted the Bulgarian Millet - an entity combining the modern notion for a nation with the Ottoman principle of Millet. It also turned the Bulgarian Exarch into both a religious leader and an administrative head of the Millet. The new entity enjoyed internal cultural and administrative autonomy. However, it excluded non-Orthodox Bulgarians and, thus, failed to embrace all representatives of the Bulgarian ethnos. Scholars argue that the millet system was instrumental to transforming the Bulgarian Exarchate into an entity that promoted ethnoreligious nationalism amongst Orthodox Bulgarians.

During the nineteenth century, the primary source of identity was religion. Because Slavs in the geographical regions of Macedonia and Bulgaria were both Orthodox Christian and the Greek Orthodox Church was attempting to Hellenize the population, Macedonian and Bulgarian intellectuals banded together to establish a Slavic literary language in opposition to Greek. Two competing centers of literacy rose at the beginning of the nineteenth century: southwestern Macedonia and northeastern Bulgaria. These centers were different enough at every linguistic level to be competing to become the literary language. When the Bulgarian Exarchate was recognized as a millet on par with the Greek millet (on religious grounds), the designation Bulgarian was still a religious term, in opposition to Greek, and the language began to be standardized on the basis of the Bulgarian center of literacy. Intellectuals from the Macedonian center of literacy felt that their dialects were being excluded from the literary Bulgarian language. By the time the Bulgarian state gained independence in 1878, the population of Macedonia and Bulgaria was subjected to conflicting claims from the Serbian, Bulgarian, and Greek states and churches, which provided education, and a distinct Macedonian national identity was written about in print. By 1903, a separate Macedonian identity and language is solidified in the works of Krste Petkov Misirkov, who advocates for a distinct Macedonian literary language.

The dominant view in Greece considers Orthodox Christianity an integral element of the Hellenic heritage, as part of its Byzantine past. Thus, official Greek government policy from c. 1850 to c. 1950, adopted the view that speech was not a decisive factor for the establishment of a Greek national identity.

During Ottoman rule, there was a clear distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. There were different tax categories and clothes, but only in the late 18th- and early 19th century "the differentiations develop into ethnic and national forms of identification", according to Soeren Keil. The bordering countries of Serbia and Croatia consequently laid claim to Bosnia and Herzegovina; a combination of religion, ethnic identity and territorial claim was the basis for the three distinct nations.

The social system was organized around  millet . Millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity to non-Muslim populations across the  subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire  and at the same time it permitted their incorporation into the Ottoman administrative, economic and political system. The Ottoman-appointed governor collected taxes and provided security, while the local religious or cultural matters were left to the regional communities to decide. On the other hand, the sultans were Muslims and the laws that bound them were based on the  Sharia , the body of  Islam ic law, as well as various cultural customs. The Sultan, beginning in 1516, was also a  Caliph , the leader of all the  Sunni   Muslims  in the world. By the turn of the 19th century the Ottoman ruling elite recognized the need to restructure the legislative, military and judiciary systems to cope with their new political rivals in Europe. When the millet system started to lose its efficiency due to the  rise of nationalism within its borders , the Ottoman Empire explored new ways of governing its territory composed of diverse populations.

Then, during the  Tanzimat  reforms (1839–78), the Syriac Orthodox were granted independent status with the recognition of their own millet in 1873. Late 19th- and early 20th-century Syriac Orthodox intellectuals predominantly used the "Assyrian" identification. Despite this "Assyrian" intellectual trend, the identity of Syriac Orthodoxy in the Ottoman Empire in the 1910s was principally religious and linguistic.

Considering that identity during the Ottoman centuries was defined primarily by religious affiliations, such questions in the post- Ottoman  period loomed large in the burgeoning national and cultural identities. After the  Ecumenical Patriarchate  in Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, lost in 1870 jurisdictional control over the  Bulgarians  in the Ottoman Empire, the Patriarchate did not desire further schisms within its ranks. Indeed, so strong was the rivalry of Greeks with Orthodox Albanians who opted for separate cultural activities, that some of the latter category such as  Papa Kristo Negovani , a priest educated in Greek schools,  Sotir Ollani ,  Petro Nini Luarasi ,  Nuci Naco  and others were murdered for their patriotic efforts.
88_10	CAR_7a264518fe62340ed5c1bd6338307a5adf37a8e4	Before the nineteenth century, there was not much to be said about Macedonian nationalism. At this time, religion was the largest determinant of ethnic identities, with the majority of Slavs in Bulgaria and Macedonia identifying as Orthodox Christians. In the 19th century, as a result of the rival aspirations of  Greek nationalists ,  Serbian nationalists , and  Bulgarian nationalists  to establish themselves in Macedonia as the prospective successor to the Ottoman Empire, the political significance of Macedonia grew tremendously. This newfound political importance would pave the way for Macedonian nationalism, especially because early Macedonian nationalists were encouraged by foreign governments that held interests in the region. Greek nationalists were the first to mount an effective national propaganda devised to secure the loyalty of Macedonian Christians. However, the Greeks were quickly challenged by Bulgarian nationalists. Macedonia and Bulgaria united in their struggle against Hellenization and archaization, not concerned with differentiation among themselves. It is as a result of their struggle against the Hellenizing policies of the Phanariot Patriarchate from the 1840s through the 1860s that Macedonian national consciousness emerged, along with the first attempts at a Macedonian literary language in the form of a unified Macedo-Bulgarian language based mostly on Macedonian. For many Bulgarians, freeing the Macedonian lands from the control of the Ottoman Empire was perceived as part of Bulgarian national liberation, something that would quickly lead to extended borders for their state. Their increased landmass was only short-lived, as Bulgarian possession of the entire Macedonian territory was reversed by the Berlin Congress in 1878 and given back to the sultan. The Serbian government, knowing that attempts to forcibly assimilate Slavic Macedonians into Serbians as a method of incorporating Macedonia would be unsuccessful due to the Bulgarian influence in the region, supported Macedonian nationalists in an attempt to stimulate opposition to Bulgarian incorporation of Macedonia.  Austria-Hungary  not only encouraged Macedonian nationalism, but also asserted the distinct ethnic character of Slavic Macedonians so as to deny both Bulgaria and Serbia the ability to annex Macedonia. In the 1890s, Macedonian nationalists found further support from  Russians  and Russian-made ethnic maps that showed a Slavic Macedonian ethnicity, resulting in many Macedonian nationalists moving to Russia in order to mobilize.

The Orthodox congregation was included in a specific ethno-religious community under Graeco-Byzantine domination called  Rum millet . Its name was derived from the Byzantine (Roman) subjects of the Ottoman Empire, but all Orthodox Christians were considered part of the same millet in spite of their differences in ethnicity and language. According to this, the Muslim communities in Epirus were classified as Turks, while the Orthodox (Rum), like the Souliotes, were classified as Greeks. Moreover, national consciousness and affiliations were absent in Ottoman Epirus during this era. Latter Greek official policy from the middle of the nineteenth century until the middle twentieth century, adopted a similar view: that speech was not a decisive factor for the establishment of a Greek national identity. As such, the dominant ideology in Greece considered as Greek leading figures of the Greek state and obscured the links of some Orthodox people such as Souliotes had to the Albanian language.

In the 19th century, the Serbian national identity was manifested, with awareness of history and tradition, medieval heritage, cultural unity, despite living under different empires. Three elements, together with the legacy of the  Nemanjić dynasty , were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the  Serbian Orthodox Church ,  Kosovo Myth , and the  Serbian language . When the  Principality of Serbia  gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, Orthodoxy became crucial in defining  the national identity , instead of language which was shared by other South Slavs ( Croats  and  Bosniaks ). The tradition of  slava , the family saint feast day, is an important ethnic marker of Serb identity, and is usually regarded their most significant and most solemn  feast day .

The idea of  nation state  was an increasing emphasis during the 19th century, on the  ethnic  and  racial  origins of the nations. The most noticeable characteristic was the degree to which nation states use the state as an instrument of national unity, in economic, social and cultural life. By the 19th century, the Ottomans had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in science, technology, and industry. By that time Bulgarians had initiated a purposeful struggle against the  Greek  clerics. Bulgarian religious leaders had realised that any further struggle for the rights of the  Bulgarians  in the  Ottoman Empire  could not succeed unless they managed to obtain at least some degree of autonomy from the  Patriarchate of Constantinople . The foundation of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870, which included most of Macedonia by a  firman  of Sultan  Abdülaziz  was the direct result of the struggle of the Bulgarian Orthodox against the domination of the Greek  Patriarchate of Constantinople  in the 1850s and 1860s.
88_10	CAR_b2e323c40447e8c1adc25ef755f59c9f2aaa37b8	In the  Ottoman Empire , a millet was a separate legal court pertaining to "personal law" under which a  confessional community  (a group abiding by the laws of Muslim  Sharia , Christian  Canon law , or Jewish  Halakha ) was allowed to rule itself under its own laws. Despite frequently being referred to as a "system", before the nineteenth century the organization of what are now retrospectively called millets in the Ottoman Empire was far from systematic. Rather, non-Muslims were simply given a significant degree of autonomy within their own community, without an overarching structure for the 'millet' as a whole. The notion of distinct millets corresponding to different religious communities within the empire would not emerge until the eighteenth century. Subsequently, the existence of the millet system was justified through numerous foundation myths linking it back to the time of Sultan  Mehmed II  (r. 1451-81), although it is now understood that no such system existed in the fifteenth century. After the Ottoman  Tanzimat  (1839–76) reforms, the term was used for legally protected religious  minority group s, similar to the way other countries use the word nation. The word millet comes from the  Arabic  word millah (ملة) and literally means "nation". The millet system has been called an example of pre-modern  religious pluralism .

Confessional communities on local issues were functioning like the  autonomous territories . The Ottoman millet specifically referred to the separate legal courts pertaining to personal law under which sections of the society were allowed to rule themselves with fairly little interference from the  central system . Each millet was under the supervision of an  Ethnarch  ('national' leader), most often a religious hierarch. Armenian millet was under the  Armenian Apostolic Church . The Millets had a great deal of power - they set their own laws and collected and distributed their own taxes. As the people of "The Book" Armenians were able to maintain their houses of worship, obtain religious literature, and employ clergy of their faith for their congregations. These were rights given in the local level. These rights become limited with the economic and technological developments of the 18th century. The Ottoman citizens wanted representation in national level. They wanted to have participation more than local level.

Kemalist nationalism originates from the  social contract  theories, especially from the principles advocated by  Jean-Jacques Rousseau  and his  Social Contract . The Kemalist perception of social contract was effected by the  dissolution of the Ottoman Empire  which was perceived as a product of failure of the Ottoman " Millet " system and the ineffective  Ottomanism . Kemalist nationalism, after experiencing the Ottoman Empire's breakdown into pieces, defined the social contract as its "highest ideal". 
88_10	CAR_b97f752b071624c8e0ebaea1b4343c89d777be94	Ottomanism was a form of  nationalism , likely inspired and created as a reaction to European ideas of nationalism and the growing Western involvement in the Ottoman Empire. Following the  Tanzimat  reforms, Ottomanism developed of of a need to bring the Empire together. The Ottomans feared the growing threat the Europeans posed, especially after events like the  Treaty of Balta Liman  that allowed for British merchants in the Empire to be taxed equally to the locals, and the growing concern of the Great Powers over the treatment of Christians and Jews within the Empire. The Ottomans thought that if they could unite the Empire fully under one state entity, then they would be stronger and the Europeans would have a harder time encroaching on Ottoman territory, as well as Ottoman people. Previously, the empire was vastly split into many small communities that mostly governed themselves. The Sultan oversaw these communities, however most adhered to their own laws and beliefs. This was a reason the  Ancien Regime  Ottoman Empire was so successful, because the Sultan didn't force any major changes on populations as he conquered them. Though because of nationalism, the rise of nation-states with shared senses of identities began to rise in Europe, most notably with the  Greek War of Independence  which also started affecting the Ottoman Empire. From these instances Ottomanism was developed as a social and political response, and a hope to help save the Empire from its downfall.
88_10	CAR_b9a064ddc0b4d1256429004145b681e23b829616	After the  fall of Constantinople  to the  Ottoman Empire  in 1453, all Orthodox Christians were treated as a  lower class of people . The Rum millet was instituted by  Sultan Mehmet II  who set himself to reorganise the state as the conscious heir of the  East Roman Empire . The Orthodox congregation was included in a specific ethno-religious community under Greco-Byzantine domination. Its name was derived from the former Eastern Roman (a.k.a. Byzantine) subjects of the Ottoman Empire, but all Orthodox  Greeks ,  Bulgarians ,  Albanians ,  Vlachs  and  Serbs , as well as   Georgians  and  Arab Christians , were considered part of the same  millet  in spite of their differences in ethnicity and language. Belonging to this Orthodox commonwealth became more important to the common people than their ethnic origins. This community became a basic form of social organization and source of identity for all the ethnic groups inside it and most people began to identify themselves simply as "Christians". However, under Ottoman rule ethnonyms never disappeared, which indicates that some form of ethnic identification was preserved. This is evident from a Sultan's  Firman  from 1680 which lists the ethnic groups in the Balkan lands of the Empire as follows: Greeks (Rum), Albanians (Arnaut), Serbs (Sirf), Vlachs (Eflak) and the Bulgarians (Bulgar).
88_10	CAR_c45c39c4c52d2a821f084b694339c1fbfc2ccf50	Under the  millet system , Kurds' primary form of identification was religious with  Sunni Islam  being the top in the hierarchy (millet-i hakimiye). While the Ottoman Empire embarked on a modernization and centralization campaign known as the  Tanzimat  (1829–1879), Kurdish regions retained much of their autonomy and tribal chiefs their power. The  Sublime Porte  made little attempt to alter the traditional power structure of "segmented,  agrarian  Kurdish societies" –  agha ,  sheikh , and  tribal chief . Because of the Kurds' geographical position at the southern and eastern fringe of the empire and the mountainous  topography  of their territory, in addition to the limited transportation and communication system, agents of the state had little access to Kurdish provinces and were forced to make informal agreements with tribal chiefs. This bolstered the Kurds' authority and autonomy; for instance, the Ottoman  qadi  and  mufti  as a result did not have jurisdiction over  religious law  in most Kurd regions. In 1908, the  Young Turks  come to power asserting a radical form of Turkish ethnic identity and closed Ottoman associations and non-Turkish schools. They launched a campaign of political oppression and resettlement against ethnic minorities – Kurds,  Laz people , and  Armenians , but in the wartime context they could not afford to antagonize ethnic minorities too much. At the end of World War I, Kurds still had the legal right to conduct their affairs in Kurdish, celebrate unique traditions, and identify themselves as a distinct ethnic group.  The  Treaty of Sèvres  signed in 1920 "suggested" an independent Kurdish and Armenian state but after the establishment of the Turkish Republic by a Turk ethnonationalist government which balked at the treaty, the 1923  Lausanne Treaty  was signed which made no mention of the Kurds. The once politically unified  Ottoman Kurdistan  was then divided into the different administrative and political systems in Iraq, Turkey and Syria.
88_10	CAR_c88ec87a50b93d68607acf4102b1f84ce58ad449	The Greek Revolution was not an isolated event; numerous failed attempts at regaining independence took place throughout the history of the  Ottoman era . In 1603, there was an attempt in  Morea  to restore the Byzantine Empire. Throughout the 17th century there was great resistance to the Ottomans in the  Peloponnese  and elsewhere, as evidenced by revolts led by  Dionysius the Philosopher  in 1600 and 1611 in  Epirus . The Ottoman rule of Morea was interrupted by the  Morean War , as the peninsula came under  Venetian  rule for 30 years. Between the 1680s and the Ottoman reconquest in 1715 during the  Ottoman–Venetian War , the province would remain in turmoil from then on and throughout the 17th century, as the bands of the  klepht s multiplied. The first great uprising was the Russian-sponsored  Orlov Revolt  of the 1770s, which was crushed by the Ottomans after having limited success. After the crushing of the uprising, the Muslim Albanians ravaged many regions in mainland Greece. However, the  Maniots  continually resisted Turkish rule, enjoying virtual autonomy and defeating several Turkish incursions into their region, the most famous of which was the  invasion of 1770 . During the  second Russo-Turkish War , the Greek community of  Trieste  financed a small fleet under  Lambros Katsonis , which was a nuisance for the Turkish navy; during the war klephts and armatoloi rose once again.At the same time, a number of Greeks enjoyed a privileged position in the Ottoman state as members of the Ottoman bureaucracy. Greeks controlled the affairs of the Orthodox Church through the  Ecumenical Patriarchate , based in Constantinople, as the higher clergy of the Orthodox Church was mostly of Greek origin. Thus, as a result of the Ottoman  millet system , the predominantly Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate enjoyed control over the Empire's Orthodox subjects (the Rum milleti). Modern scholars assert that the  Greek Orthodox Church  played a pivotal role in the preservation of national identity, the development of Greek society and the resurgence of Greek nationalism. From the 18th century and onwards, members of prominent Greek families in Constantinople, known as  Phanariotes  (after the  Phanar  district of the city) gained considerable control over Turkish foreign policy and eventually over the bureaucracy as a whole.
88_10	CAR_d54a8a8d3137dcc9ab4e5a6ee8599aba368273c9	The Armenian national ideology developed long after the Greek movement, however the factors contributing to the emergence of  Armenian nationalism  made the movement far more similar to that of the Greeks than those of other ethnic groups. Unresolved social problems in the Empire began to feed Armenian national politics, along the other ethnic groups. As the  Millet (Ottoman Empire)  structure degraded, Armenians begin to rethink their position in the world. The Armenian subjects of the Empire influenced by the  Armenian Diaspora  and the network of congregations and schools of the Protestant missionaries throughout the Empire. After intervention in Russia in 1877-1878, Russian-Ottoman border brought new the political and military structure. The numbers of  Circassians  and  Laz  from the Russian Empire forcefully deported to Ottoman Empire. These emigrations brought tensions and changed the population distribution and balance of power within the local communities in eastern Anatolia. Russia became protectorate of Christian Armenians and this created a relatively more hostile environment to the Muslims (Kurds) who were left under Russian control.  Kurdish-Armenian relations  come to another turn. The newly established relations were complex. The change did not only effected the Armenian Millet but also the local non-tribal Kurds as well. The Kurdish tribal leaders that fled during the war began to express their power along the countryside. The region's social structure, coexistence of the communities was broken. The broken social structure required implementation of new reforms.

Each millet had an internal system of governance based upon its religious law, such as  Sharia ,  Catholic   Canon law , or  Jewish   Halakha . The Ottoman Empire tried to modernize the code with the reforms of 1839  Hatt-i Sharif  which tried to end the confusion in the judicial sphere by extending the legal equality to all citizens.

Nevertheless, due to the advanced assimilation of the Aromanians, this came too late to lead to the creation of a distinct Aromanian national identity; indeed, as  Gustav Weigand  noted in 1897, most Aromanians were not only indifferent, but actively hostile to their own national movement.

Like the  Greek Orthodox  and  Jewish  minorities of the  Ottoman Empire , they constituted a distinct  millet , led by the  Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople . Under this system, Christians and Jews were considered  religious minorities / second-class citizens ; they were subjected to elevated taxation, but in return they were granted autonomy within their own religious communities and were exempted from military service. Growing religious and political influence from neighboring communities necessitated implementation of security measures that often required a longer waiting period for minorities to seek  legal recourse  in the courts. Under Ottoman rule, Armenians formed three distinct millets:  Armenian Orthodox Gregorians ,  Armenian Catholics , and  Armenian Protestants  (in the 19th century).

Tanzimat  reforms aimed to encourage  Ottomanism  among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into the Ottoman society with new laws and regulations. With the  Tanzimat  era the regulation called " Regulation of the Armenian Nation " (Turkish: "Nizâmnâme−i Millet−i Ermeniyân") was introduced on 29 March 1863, over the Millet organization, which granted extensive privileges and autonomy concerning self−governance. The Armenian Nation, "Millet−i Ermeniyân", which is considered here, is the  Armenian Orthodox Gregorian  nation (millet) of that time. In a very short time, the Ottoman Empire passed another regulation over "Nizâmnâme−i Millet−i Ermeniyân" developed by the Patriarchate Assemblies of Armenians, which was named as the  Islahat Fermânı  (Firman of the Reforms).  The "Firman of the Reforms" gave immense privileges to the Armenians, which formed a "governance in governance" to eliminate the  aristocratic dominance  of the Armenian  nobles  by development of the political strata in the society. These two reforms, which were theoretically perfect examples of social change by law, brought serious stress over Ottoman political and administrative structure.

The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the  Kanûn-ı Esâsî  (meaning " Basic Law " in Ottoman Turkish), written by members of the  Young Ottomans , which was promulgated on 23 November 1876.

At the time of the edict,  millets  had gained a large amount of religious autonomy within the empire, threatening the central government.

The relationship between predator and prey is one that is typically beneficial to the predator, and detrimental to the prey species. Sometimes, however, predation has indirect benefits to the prey species, though the individuals preyed upon themselves do not benefit. This means that, at each applicable stage, predator and prey species are in an  evolutionary arms race  to maximize their respective abilities to obtain food or avoid being eaten. This interaction has resulted in a vast array of  adaptation s in both groups.

Ground squirrels will also perceive humans, livestock and cars as threats. Ground squirrels have two specific alarm calls used to warn others of predators.  One call, known as the churr call or the trill, is made of a series of more than five notes given rapidly. These calls are given for predators that pose less immediate threats, usually terrestrial predators. Individuals that are close to the alarm caller will respond by standing on their back legs (posting), running on a rock to get a better view of the predator or by returning to their core area.

The newts produce a potent  neurotoxin  that concentrates in their skin. Garter snakes have evolved resistance to this toxin through a series of genetic  mutation s, and prey upon the newts. The relationship between these animals has resulted in an  evolutionary arms race  that has driven toxin levels in the newt to extreme levels. This is an example of coevolution because differential survival caused each organism to change in response to changes in the other.

But sometimes the predator population overwhelms the prey to the point of devastating the prey population, subsequently resulting in a devastation of the predator population. Some studies indicate that  the roles of each may become reversed to the point that prey begin to eat the predators.

89_1	CAR_1cf07be609b14b4099a1b025cb6c5368407f2aad	A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in  pursuit predation , or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in  ambush predator s. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a  jaguar  or a  human ; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a  bottlenose dolphin  swallowing a fish, or a  snake ,  duck  or  stork  swallowing a  frog . Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic  cat s and  dog s are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit.  Some predation entails  venom  that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the  box jellyfish  does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the  cone shell . In some cases, the venom, as in  rattlesnake s and some  spider s, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or  digestive system  of the predator.  Baleen whale s, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale.  Seed predation  and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as  seed s and  egg s represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest  bone s, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.
89_1	CAR_2c95e6d5c9a71264c370398fbfd9b6293c855bb0	The first experiments with  predation  and  spatial heterogeneity  were conducted by  G.F. Gause  in the 1930s, based on the  Lotka-Volterra equation , which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no further application had been conducted. The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested that the relationship between predators and their prey would result in population  oscillations  over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause's early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator–prey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the  population cycle s accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly to the left of the peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker's experiments expanded on those of Gause by examining how both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator–prey oscillations.
89_1	CAR_34b38a6a0b045595319863992a0a4cf3b53a6404	It is fairly clear that predators tend to lower the survival and  fecundity  of their prey, but on a higher level of organization,  population s of predator and prey species also interact. It is obvious that predators depend on prey for survival, and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations. It is not so obvious, however, that predators affect prey populations. Eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its  carrying capacity .

In a study in the Italian Alps, the most common prey species of all was the  European roe deer  (Capreolus capreolus), which made up 32.2% of nest remains. The roe deer was also a prominent prey item in the  French Pyrenees  (14.9%) and  Switzerland  (14.6%), respectively. In several parts of the Scottish Highlands,  red deer  (Cervus elaphus) are eaten with some regularity, the maximum representation there being 22.3% of prey remains in the Northwest Highlands. In North America, several deer species, but mainly  mule deer  (Odocoileus hemionus) fawns, were significant in the diet in Washington state (14.3%) and  California  (12.7%). Around the Himalayas, the small  white-bellied musk deer  (Moschus leucogaster) is reportedly a favorite prey item (though no quantitative analysis are known). In the near Arctic regions of Scandinavia,  reindeer  (Rangifer tarandus) of both semi-domestic and wild stock are fed on with some regularity; one study in northern Sweden found reindeer formed 11.4% of prey items. In the northernmost stretches of  Alaska , golden eagles are more scarce than in equivalent areas of Scandinavia and only occasionally hunt wild reindeer. However, golden eagles were reportedly the most prolific predator of neonatal calves from the  Porcupine caribou  (Rangifer tarandus granti) herd of central Alaska. Partial  moose  (Alces alces) remains have been found at a nest in Sweden. Live fawns and carrion probably comprise most of the golden eagle’s consumption of deer (certainly in larger-bodied species such as red deer). Among wild bovids, eagles are reportedly the main predator of  Saiga antelope  (Saiga tatarica) calves in Mongolia and are regularly reported to take  chamois  (Rupicapra rupicapra) and  Alpine ibex  (Capra ibex) calves in Europe.  Mongolian gazelle s (Procapra gutturosa) comprised about 15% of the remains found at a nest in Mongolia. Up to seven wild species of goat, five other wild species of sheep and at least two wild gazelle species are confirmed golden eagle prey. In North America,  pronghorn  (Antilocapra americana) are occasionally hunted.

Surely if they could all get together and agree on a common warning signal, the predator would have fewer detrimental experiences, and the prey would lose fewer individuals educating it. But no such conference needs to take place, as a prey species that just so happens to look a little like a harmful species will be safer than its conspecifics, leading to a tendency toward a single warning language. This can lead to the evolution of both Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, depending on whether the prey is harmful, as well, or just a free-rider. Multiple species can join this protective cooperative, expanding the mimicry ring.

The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of  strangulation . By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them. With smaller prey, such as monkeys and hares, the tiger bites the  nape , often breaking the  spinal cord , piercing the  windpipe , or severing the  jugular vein  or  common carotid artery . Though rarely observed, some tigers have been recorded to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of  sloth bear s.

When this happens, the predators would be able to reproduce more and possibly change their hunting habits.  As the number of predators rise, the number of prey decline.  This results in food scarcity for predators that can eventually lead to the death of many predators."

This success rate is a consequence of the "decision" of which prey to pursue based on initial conditions. Observations of several species of perching dragonflies show more pursuit initiations at larger starting distances for larger size prey species than for much smaller prey. Further evidence points to a potential bias towards larger prey, due to more substantial metabolic rewards. This bias is in spite of the fact that larger prey are typically faster and choosing them results in less successful pursuits. Dragonflies high success rate for prey capture may also be due to their "interception" foraging method. Unlike tracking foraging methods, in which predators focus on closing in on the current position of their prey, the interception method has the dragonfly seeking the position directly ahead of their prey as a way of surmising a prey's future location. Perching dragonflies ( Libellulidae  family), the largest family of dragonflies, have been observed "staking out" high density prey spots prior to pursuit. There are no noticeable distinctions in prey capture efficiency between male and female dragonflies. Further, percher dragonflies are bound by their visual range. They are more likely to engage in pursuit when prey come within a subtended angle of around 1-2 degrees. Angles greater than this are outside of a dragonflies visual range.
89_1	CAR_59e836b57f48682712aab966e8400511668fe41b	Moose often show aggression to other animals as well; especially predators. Bears are common predators of moose calves and, rarely, adults. Alaskan moose have been reported to successfully fend off attacks from black bears, brown bears and grizzlies. Moose have been known to stomp attacking wolves, which makes them less preferred as prey to the wolves. Moose are fully capable of killing bears and wolves. A moose of either sex that is confronted by danger may let out a loud roar, more resembling that of a predator than a prey animal. European moose are often more aggressive than North American moose, such as the moose in Sweden, which often become very agitated at the sight of a predator. However, like all ungulates known to attack predators, the more aggressive individuals are always darker in color.
89_1	CAR_5c883442377749587f06d3632e695969c6e4567c	This theory postulates that multicellularity arose as a means for prey to escape predation. Larger prey are less likely to be preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that multicellularity arose when the first predators evolved. By assembling as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore multicellularity was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory  protist , Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a prey population of  Chlorella  vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting because before the predator was introduced, the  population  of  Chlorella  vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal species retained a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular.
89_1	CAR_5ecadf25a7487a8b27d773ec69f5b351d41a43e4	Intraguild predation is common in nature and widespread across communities and ecosystems.  Intraguild predators must share at least one prey species and usually occupy the same trophic  guild , and the degree of IGP depends on factors such as the size, growth, and population density of the predators, as well as the population density and behavior of their shared prey.  When creating theoretical models for intraguild predation, the competing species are classified as the "top predator" or the "intermediate predator," (the species more likely to be preyed upon).  In theory, intraguild predation is most stable if the top predator benefits strongly from feeding on the intermediate predator, and if the intermediate predator is a better competitor for the shared prey resource.
89_1	CAR_687e2f172136457f76c7446807568880b361fb90	Apex predators affect prey species' population dynamics. Where two competing species are in an ecologically unstable relationship, apex predators tend to create stability if they prey upon both. Inter-predator relationships are also affected by apex status. Non-native fish, for example, have been known to devastate formerly dominant predators. One lake manipulation study found that when the non-native  smallmouth bass  was removed,  lake trout , the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its  trophic level .
89_1	CAR_6af8ff7c72308149ab4d43f7799d335d7c7f1839	While  host-parasite  and  mutualistic  interactions are determined by task-based phenotypes,  predator-prey  interactions are determined by behavior. Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey.  Selection  favors behavioral strategies in prey that enable them to avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic predator-prey interaction networks in which selective forces are constantly changing as a consequence of the emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using  spatially structured populations . On the other hand, host-parasite and mutualistic coevolution are often done in well-mixed environments, though the choice of the environment is at the discretion of the experimenter.
89_1	CAR_6f77e64ecbc8ce8952e69dda669fdf2a3b98d08e	Cott was well aware that he was publishing in wartime. There are, as  Julian Huxley  remarks in his 'Introduction', references throughout the book to the human analogues of animal camouflage and concealment. For example, in the section on 'Adaptive Silence', the  kestrel  is said to "practise  dive-bombing  attacks", or "after the fashion of a fighter 'plane" to fly down other birds, while "Owls have solved the problem of the silent air-raid"; Cott spends the rest of that paragraph on the "method which has recently been rediscovered and put into practice" of shutting off a bomber's engines and "gliding noiselessly down towards their victims" at Barcelona in the  Spanish Civil War . In the concluding chapter, Cott explicitly states "The innumerable visible devices used .. in peace-time and in war-time .. are merely rediscovered .. applications of colour that have already reached a high .. degree of specialization and perfection .. in the animal world", mentioning predator-prey relationships, sexual selection and signalling to rivals. He then compares the "hunting disguises put on .. as a means of approaching, ambushing or alluring game, and the  sniping suits , concealed machine-gun posts, and booby traps" with the camouflage of animal predators; and similarly he compares "protective disguises" with the "photographer's hide and the gunner's observation post." In the same section, Cott compares intentionally visible signs with animal warning colours: "The policeman's white gloves have their parallel in the white stripes or spots of nocturnal  skunks  and  carabid s.

89_1	CAR_76bdc8b8cfef856c7d7cb4593b45e89e2bf4d671	The  Lotka–Volterra  predator–prey model describes the basic population dynamics under predation. The solution to these equations in the simple one-predator species, one-prey species model is a stable linked oscillation of population levels for both predator and prey. However, when time lags between respective population growths are modeled, these oscillations will tend to amplify, eventually leading to extinction of both species. The  Ricker model  exemplifies this dynamic. 
89_1	CAR_76f2d7873521e189254bec4eba4e44cc62670444	This is where one organism hunts and eats the other organism. The organism hunting is called the  predator , while the organism being hunted is called the  prey . Energy received from the Sun is transferred from animals when the prey is eaten by the predator. The predator now has its prey's energy.
89_1	CAR_7752518dcea4c58c62238477eb837f6b9ba5fddd	American crocodiles are  apex predator s, and any  aquatic  or  terrestrial  animal they encounter in  freshwater ,  riparian  and  coastal  saltwater habitats is potential prey. For a long time, primary prey throughout their lifetime was thought to be  fish ; due to the relatively narrow snout as indicative of this piscivorous preference. However new studies shed light into the dietary preference of this species. The snout of the American crocodile is broader than some specialized fish-eating crocodilians (i.e.  gharial s (Gavialis gangeticus),  freshwater crocodile  (C. johnsoni), etc.), allowing it to supplement its diet with a wider variety of prey. In addition the snout gets even broader and bulkier as the animal matures, a sign for a shift in prey items. Prey species have ranged in size from the  insect s taken by young crocodiles to full-grown  cattle  taken by large adults, and can include various  bird s,  mammal s,  turtle s,  crab s,  snail s,  frog s, and occasionally  carrion . In  Haiti , hatchling and juvenile crocodiles lived primarily off of  fiddler crab s (Uca ssp.), making up 33.8% and 62.3% of the diet by weight, respectively. Elsewhere, aquatic insects and their larvae and snails are near the top of the food list for crocodiles at this very early age. Immature and subadult crocodiles, per a study in  Mexico , have a more diverse diet that can include insects, fish, frogs, small turtles, birds and small mammals. One specimen of  had a catfish, a  mourning dove  (Zenaida macroura) and a  bare-tailed woolly opossum  (Caluromys philander) in its stomach. In Florida,  bass ,  tarpon  (Megalops atlanticus) and especially  mullet , large  crab s,  snake s,  mammal s that habit the  riparian  and  coastal  regions of the  Everglades , such as  opossum s and  raccoon s appeared to be the primary prey of subadult and adult American crocodiles. In  Haiti , adults appeared to live largely off of various  bird s (many of which are breeding large waders and other water birds such as  heron ,  stork s,  flamingo s ( Phoenicopterus ruber ),  pelican s (Pelecanus ssp.),  grebe s,  coot s ( Fulica americana ) and  moorhen s ( Gallinula chloropus )), followed by concentrations of marine fish including  Tilapia  and  Cichlasoma , at times being seen to capture  turtle s,  dog s and  goat s. One  adult from  Honduras  had stomach contents consisting of a  crocodile of its own species, a  turtle  shell and  peccary  hooves. It was noted that historically in Mexico that, among several local farmers, the capturing of livestock by crocodiles has been a source of some conflict between humans and crocodiles and large adults occasionally can become habitual predators of goats, dogs,  pig s and cattle. In  Quintana Roo ,  Mexico , most prey that could be determined was fish for sub-adults and adults with sub-adults having a broader prey base than either younger or adult crocodiles. In  Costa Rica , American crocodiles have been recorded hunting and killing adult female  olive ridley sea turtle s (Lepidochelys olivacea) when they come to nest around beaches. Reportedly, these crocodiles hunt primarily in the first few hours after nightfall, especially on moonless nights, although they will feed at any time. It hunts in the typical way for most crocodilian, ambushing terrestrial prey when it comes to edge of the water or is sitting in shallows and dragging it down to be drowned or attempting to ambush aquatic prey from near the surface of the water.
89_1	CAR_7e0771344256779f8da68c370081f0f0532298c2	Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using  finite element analysis  on an Allosaurus skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148  N , less than the values for  alligator s (13,000 N),  lion s (4,167 N), and  leopard s (2,268 N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500 N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that Allosaurus used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike Tyrannosaurus, which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods. Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey. The original authors noted that Allosaurus itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the  palate  and lessen stress. Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like Allosaurus were "flesh grazers" which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey. Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager et al. from the University of Bristol also indicate Allosaurus could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with Tyrannosaurus and the therizinosaurid  Erlikosaurus  in the same study, it was found that Allosaurus had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 79 degree angle. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.
89_1	CAR_7ea2d32fd8d649d1067a496206ac888bec9159ea	In many species that fall prey to pursuit predation, gregariousness on a massive scale has evolved as a protective behavior and can be conspecific or heterospecific within a given group. This is primarily due to the  Confusion Effect , which states that if prey animals congregate in large groups, predators will have more difficulty identifying and tracking specific individuals.  This effect has greater influence when individuals are visually similar and less distinguishable. In groups where individuals are visually similar, there is a negative correlation between group size and predator success rates. This may mean that the overall number of attacks decreases with larger group size or that the number of attacks per kill increases with larger group size.  This is especially true in open habitats, such as  grassland s or  open ocean  ecosystems, where view of the prey group is unobstructed, in contrast to a forest or  reef . Prey species in these open environments tend to be especially gregarious, with notable examples being  starling s and  sardine s. When individuals of the herd are visually dissimilar, however, the success rate of predators increases dramatically.  In one study,  wildebeest  on the African Savannah were selected at random and had their horns painted white. This introduced a distinction, or oddity, into the population, and researchers found that wildebeest who had white horns were preyed upon at substantially higher rates.  By standing out, individuals are not as easily lost in the crowd, and so predators are able to track and pursue them with higher fidelity. This has been proposed as the reason why many schooling fish show little to no  sexual dimorphism , and why many species in heterospecific schools bear a close resemblance to other species in their school.

Diet of the scaled crab is known to include  brittle star s as they have been witnessed feeding on the  echinoderms . Few other  prey  species have been observed but it can assumed that other food sources are similar to those of similar crab species. The crab themselves are prey to the  sea otter  and presumably other large predators. Females and males differ in the structure of their abdomen. The female's abdomen is covered in plates whereas the male's is covered in vestigial plates. These plates give the male a rubbery look and feel to their abdomens. Many have be observed to have a   symbiotic  relationship with certain species of  sea anemone . This is why you will also find them inhabiting areas containing  Metridium senile  and  Metridium giganteum .

If it were stable, non-zero populations might be attracted towards it, and as such the dynamics of the system might lead towards the extinction of both species for many cases of initial population levels.  However, as the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point, and hence unstable, it follows that the extinction of both species is difficult in the model. (In fact, this could only occur if the prey were artificially completely eradicated, causing the predators to die of starvation. If the predators were eradicated, the prey population would grow without bound in this simple model): The populations of prey and predator can get infinitesimally close to zero and still recover.
89_1	CAR_896c33e6ddfab83881abb05243b6fcfe9cef2794	Classification of predators by the extent to which they feed on and interact with their prey is one way ecologists may wish to categorize the different types of predation. Instead of focusing on what they eat, this system classifies predators by the way in which they eat, and the general nature of the interaction between predator and prey species. Two factors are considered here: How close the predator and prey are (in the latter two cases the term prey may be replaced with  host ) and whether or not the prey are directly killed by the predator is considered, with true predation and parasitoidism involving certain death.
89_1	CAR_8ae99f0165d60ce59ee32e1574998d684b31c79b	Andrew Parker  has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs – smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease. Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion. Eyes may well have evolved long before the start of the Cambrian. It is also difficult to understand why the evolution of eyesight would have caused an explosion, since other senses, such as smell and pressure detection, can detect things at a greater distance in the sea than sight can; but the appearance of these other senses apparently did not cause an evolutionary explosion.
89_1	CAR_8cc110beea8f6d860bdf4587eb4cb94c222160a8	In keeping with the needs of a predator living in a prey-sparse desert environment, the prairie falcon has developed a wide range of hunting and flight styles.   Like the  Merlin , it often hunts by flying fast and low, at a height of only a few meters or so, hoping to find surprised prey as it comes over the terrain or around bushes. Its cruising speed is estimated at 72 km/h (45 mph) and it accelerates in the chase.  A variation on this method is for the falcon to stoop down from altitude and then level out near the ground, initially traveling at more than 100 mph at altitudes of a meter or two, sometimes gliding for more than a kilometer this way. If the rapidly approaching falcon flushes bird prey, the falcon has the speed advantage and may rapidly close with the prey.  Another variation on these low attacks is using terrain as cover to approach beneath a flock of birds, then using its speed to perform a rapid climbing surprise attack into the flock.   It also pursues prey sighted from a perch in the manner of the short-winged  accipiter  hawks, again often flying low and using its speed to close with the prey in a tail-chase. Prairie falcons may even deliberately emulate the flight style of other birds in order to deceive potential prey and allow a surprise attack by the falcon.  The dramatic high speed diving stoop from high altitude in the manner of the peregrine falcon, allowing overtaking the swiftest of birds or delivering a knock-out blow to large prey, is also a very natural part of the hunting repertoire of the prairie falcon. At impact the prey is hit with a closed foot or feet, or swiped with an open foot armed with talons. High-speed films have shown that this second method is the more common, with the toes closed into a “fist” immediately after striking. The claw on the hind toe, or hallux, is particularly effective and deadly in raking the prey. When the closed foot strike is used it is typically directed against the head or wing of the prey, and if it does not outright kill, the prey is often rendered unconscious or unable to fly.  These strikes are often accompanied by an explosion of feathers and an audible impact that may be heard from the ground hundreds of feet away.  They have been known to be so forceful they can literally separate the head from the body of the prey.

The per capita effect of predators on the prey population (the harvest rate) is modeled by a function g which is a function of the  ratio  N/P of prey to predators. Predators receivea a reproductive payoff, e, for consuming prey, and die at rate u. Making predation pressure a function of the ratio of prey to predators contrasts with the prey dependent  Lotka–Volterra equations , where the effect of predators on the prey population is simply a function of the magnitude of the prey population g(N). Because the number of prey harvested by each predator decreases as predators become more  dense , ratio dependent predation represents an example of a  trophic function . Ratio dependent predation may account for  heterogeneity   in large-scale natural systems in which predator efficiency decreases when prey is scarce. The merit of ratio dependent versus prey dependent models of predation has been the subject of much controversy, especially between the biologists  Lev R. Ginzburg  and Peter A. Abrams. Ginzburg purports that ratio dependent models more accurately depict predator-prey interactions while Abrams maintains that these models make unwarranted complicating assumptions.
89_1	CAR_8dbc619444884ed212299d68271680ffa4a22291	Epomis larvae hunt in a rare  reversal  of the usual predator-prey relationship between amphibians and insects. They lure their amphibian predators by making prey-like movements, then evade the predator's attack and disable the predator, often with a bite to the throat or underside. After the attack, the larva stays attached to the amphibian while feeding on it, similarly to  external parasites . Adult Epomis beetles are  generalist  predators but can also feed on amphibians. They sneak up behind their victims, and hold on firmly using their legs. To paralyze the victim, the beetle makes an incision in the pelvic region with its mandibles. There is speculation that the incision cuts leg muscles. The amphibian loses its ability to move and is eaten by the beetle. Scientists speculate that Epomis evolved this behavior as an aggressive evasion tactic in response to  predation  by amphibians and the success of this tactic led to Epomis becoming an obligate predator itself.

When prey (plants) are numerous their predators (herbivores) increase in numbers, reducing the prey population, which in turn causes predator number to decline. The prey population eventually recovers, starting a new cycle.  This suggests that the population of the herbivore fluctuates around the carrying capacity of the food source, in this case the plant.

Competition may occur between the hawk and  owl  species during twilight, although the differing nesting season and activity times usually results in a lack of direct competition. Although the red-tail's prey is on average larger (due in part to the scarcity of diurnal  squirrel s in the owl's diet), the owl is an occasional predator of red-tailed hawks themselves, of any age, while the hawks are not known to predate adult great horned owls. Other competitors include other large  Buteo  species such as  Swainson's hawk s and  rough-legged hawk s, as well as the  northern goshawk , since prey and foraging methods of these species occasionally overlap.Hawks have been observed following  American badger s to capture prey they flush and the two are considered potential competitors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patrick K.

89_1	CAR_9845eed45b28dff6eb5bf9b5fbf580eb72ee214d	Pursuit predation revolves around a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move to find new foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships can be used as support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also  metapopulation  persistence.

Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency. For example, "[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk" or "[t]he optimal  flight initiation distance  occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk."
89_1	CAR_adc33ba5450984492ba99de0dac1ee068e44b369	The question of why animals group together is one of the most fundamental in  sociobiology  and  behavioural ecology .  As noted above, the term herd is most commonly used of grazing animals such as ungulates, and in these cases it is believed that the strongest selective pressure leading to herding rather than a solitary existence is protection against predators. There is clearly a tradeoff involved, since on the one hand a predator may hesitate to attack a large group of animals, while on the other a large group offers an easily detected target. In the case of predators, it is often unclear whether the term herd is appropriate, since there may be some degree of coordination or role differentiation in group hunting. Predator groups are commonly smaller than grazing groups, since although a pack may be more effective at pulling down prey than a single animal, the prey then has to be shared between all members, so that the weaker animals will often be better off hunting smaller prey on their own.

Predators tend to look for signs of weakness in their prey, and therefore usually eat the old or sick animals first. This has the effect of controlling the prey population and ensuring its  evolution  in favor of genetic characteristics that render it less vulnerable to predation (and the predator may  co-evolve , in response).
89_1	CAR_af85e8698e5edf82ba12c84763d0209e1ccf2222	A  food web , or  food chain , is an example of directed network which describes the prey-predator relationship in a given ecosystem. Vertices in this type of network represent species, and the edges the prey-predator relationship. A collection of species may be represented by a single vertex if all members in that collection prey upon and are preyed on by the same organisms. A food web is often acyclic, with few exceptions such as adults preys on juveniles and parasitism. 
89_1	CAR_b2447d3e4cc247ba68945d0ae798ee95cfb4ac38	In order to study predation and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator and the other being the prey. He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of  spatial heterogeneity  and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.

It is named after  Alexander John Nicholson  and  Victor Albert Bailey . Host-parasite and  prey-predator  systems can also be represented with the Nicholson-Bailey model. The model is closely related to the  Lotka–Volterra model , which describes the dynamics of antagonistic populations (preys and predators) using  differential equation s.
89_1	CAR_c46aa09b0b03e04ab7ebc007975e6f6fb03a93f3	Ecological fitting represents a contrasting view to, and  null hypothesis  for, the hypothesis that current species interactions are evidence of  coevolution .  Coevolution  occurs when each species in a relationship imposes evolutionary selection on the other(s).  Examples could include  mutualisms  or predator-prey systems.  The traditional view of plant-insect, host-parasite, and other tightly associated species, explained by Ehrlich & Raven (1964) defines coevolution as the primary mechanism for these associations  In his 1980 paper, Janzen gives a response to these  adaptationist  explanations of why a  phenotype  or species might exist in a particular environment, and expressed his concern with what he perceived as an overuse of coevolutionary explanations for current species associations.  He stated that it would be difficult to distinguish between coevolution and ecological fitting, leading ecologists to potentially spurious explanations of current species associations.  It is difficult to determine whether a close relationship is the result of coevolution or of ecological fitting because ecological fitting is a sorting process in which only associations that 'fit', or increase  fitness (biology) , will be maintained.  When trying to determine which process is at work in a particular interaction, it is important to remember that species can only come into contact through biotic expansion and ecological fitting, followed by  adaptation  or coevolution.  Thus, both processes are important in shaping interactions and communities.
89_1	CAR_c5723ad7386b3d93c6b24b36f819659bb587d6ea	It has been observed that  predators  tend to select the most common morph in a population or species. The  search image hypothesis  proposes that an individual's  sensory system  becomes better able to detect a specific  prey  phenotype after recent experience with that same phenotype. It is clear that plant-pollinator interactions differ from predator-prey relationships, as it is beneficial to both the plant and animal for the pollinator to locate the plant. However, it has been suggested that  cognitive constraints  on  short-term memory  capabilities may limit pollinators from identifying and handling more than one floral type at a time, making plant-pollinator relationships theoretically similar to predator-prey relationships in regards to the ability to identify food sources. Although plant traits that have evolved to attract pollinators are not  cryptic , corolla colors can be more or less conspicuous with the background and pollinators that are more efficient at detecting a particular morph will minimize their  search time . Studies have demonstrated that the degree of frequency-dependence increases with the number of flowers visited, which suggests this is a learned response that develops gradually.

89_1	CAR_c7d4ae44059c2de65cbf3b65dab8a8c4550f311f	Sea lampreys are considered a  pest  in the  Great Lakes region . The species is native to the inland  Finger Lakes  and  Lake Champlain  in  New York  and  Vermont . It is not clear whether it is native to  Lake Ontario , where it was first noticed in the 1830s, or whether it was introduced through the  Erie Canal  which opened in 1825. Improvements to the  Welland Canal  in 1919 are thought to have allowed its spread from Lake Ontario to  Lake Erie , and while it was never abundant in either lake, it soon spread to  Lake Michigan ,  Lake Huron , and  Lake Superior , where it decimated indigenous fish populations in the 1930s and 1940s. They have created a problem with their aggressive parasitism on key predator species and game fish, such as  lake trout ,  lake whitefish ,  chub , and  lake herring . Elimination of these predators allowed the  alewife , another invasive species, to explode in population, having adverse effects on many native fish species. The lake trout plays a vital role in the Lake Superior ecosystem. The lake trout is considered an  apex predator , which means that they have no predators of their own. The sea lamprey is an aggressive predator by nature, which gives it a competitive advantage in a lake system where it has no predators and its prey lacks defenses against it. The sea lamprey played a large role in the destruction of the Lake Superior lake trout population. Lamprey introduction along with poor, unsustainable fishing practices caused the lake trout populations to decline drastically. The relationship between predators and prey in the Great Lakes' ecosystem then became unbalanced.

Most prey are consumed by more than one predator, and most predators have more than one prey. Their relationships are also influenced by other environmental factors.  In most cases, if one species is removed from an ecosystem, other species will most likely be affected, up to the point of extinction.

Improved agriculture, conservation, biological diversity, and epidemiology are just some of the areas that could potentially be helped through the study of coevolution and its specific hypotheses such as escape and radiate coevolution.A theory as to why we see such vast biological diversity today may be because of escape and radiate coevolution. After the organism escapes, it then radiates into multiple species, and spreads geographically. Evidence of escape and radiate coevolution can be seen through the starburst effect in plant and herbivore  clades . When analyzing clades of predator-prey associations, although it varies, the starburst effect is a good indicator that escape and radiate coevolution may be occurring. Eventually this cycle must come to an end because adaptations that  entail costs (allocation of resources, vulnerability to other predators) that at some point outweigh their benefits.Escape and radiate coevolution may support parallel  cladogenesis , wherein plant and herbivore  phylogenies  might match with ancestral insects exploiting ancestral plants. This is significant because it allows researchers to hypothesize about the relationships between ancestral organisms.  Unfortunately, there have not yet been any known examples specifically involving escape and radiate coevolution being used for hypothesizing ancestral relationships.
89_1	CAR_de4e1588d933d7e15b84f37e5faba909f3b107fd	A trophic function was first introduced in the differential equations of the  Kolmogorov  predator–prey model. It generalizes the linear case of predator–prey interaction firstly described by Volterra and Lotka in the  Lotka–Volterra equation . A trophic function represents the consumption of prey assuming a given number of predators. The trophic function (also referred to as the  functional response ) was widely applied in chemical kinetics, biophysics, mathematical physics and economics. In economics, "predator" and "prey" become various economic parameters such as prices and outputs of goods in various linked sectors such as processing and supply. These relationships, in turn, were found to behave similarly to the magnitudes in chemical kinetics, where the molecular analogues of predators and prey react chemically with each other.
89_1	CAR_e7b7a6cab091a8545bb42d3c299b939778e0a8f1	There is also an interaction between prey with periodic cycles and predators. As the population expands, there is more food available for predators. As it contracts, there is less food available for predators, putting pressure on their population numbers.

Soft prey is grasped when the tips of the teeth sink into the flesh, but the teeth pivot backwards when biting hard prey. This protects the tooth tip and allows the flattened front surface of the teeth to form a continuous plate for crushing crabs.Juvenile sharks need a higher intake of carbon than adults sharks, especially during the wet seasons. White spotted bamboo sharks have an advantage in finding carbon sources because they are benthic predators (meaning they prey on fish near the sea-bottom), as opposed to pelagic sharks like the spadenose shark. That, combined with the fact that these species of sharks have, like most sharks, electroreceptors (ampulae of lorenzini) along their snout to help them locate prey that is buried in the sand and mud, makes them very efficient users of detrital carbon resources.

The conclusion of this experiment showed that roles between species can reverse when the usual prey populations decrease to significantly low levels, causing the predators to decrease in population size also. Once this occurs, prey then begin to build up their population numbers and as they do, they prey on their original predators.

This is a positive–negative (+ −) interaction in that the predator species benefits while the prey species is harmed. Some predators kill their prey before eating them (e.g., a hawk killing a mouse). Other predators are parasites that feed on prey while alive (e.g., a vampire bat feeding on a cow). Another example is the feeding on plants of  herbivore s (e.g., a cow grazing). Predation may affect the population size of predators and prey and the number of species coexisting in a community.

89_1	MARCO_4951020	Carnivory is usually the first type of predation that comes to mind when thinking about relationships between predator and prey. Carnivory takes place when a predator consumes meat, rather than plants, and consequently kills its prey. Organisms that prefer meat over plants are accordingly called carnivores.
89_1	MARCO_5196461	Types of Prey. There are many types of predation and prey, and the example of the lion hunting the antelope is called carnivory. Predation can also occur as parasitism, in which the prey is a host that supports a parasite, such as a virus. In this case, the prey may be harmed but not killed outright like the antelope. When the prey is the same species as the predator, this is called cannibalism. Plants can also be prey, and this is called herbivory. When a deer eats grass the plant is the prey and animal the predator. Herbivory is interesting because it highlights how sometimes an organism can be predator or prey depending on the situation.

Supplement In ecology, predation is a mechanism of population control. Thus, when the number of predators is scarce the number of preys should rise. When this happens the predators would be able to reproduce more and possibly change their hunting habits. As the number of predators rises, the number of preys decline. This results in food scarcity for predators that can eventually lead to the death of many predators.
89_1	MARCO_8506718	Cougars and wolves rely on the same main food sources, but have different hunting techniques. Wolves are coursing predators, running prey down, usually in packs. Cougars are stalking predators, ambushing prey as solitary hunters.n these and other ways, wolves can change the dynamics of wildlife species across an entire ecosystem, altering predator-prey relationships and even the natural landscape. While they may contribute to declines in some species, wolves can also play an important role in the environment.

The list is far from complete, and some plants, such as  Roridula  species, exploit the prey organisms mainly in a mutualistic relationship with other creatures, such as resident organisms that contribute to the digestion of prey. In particular animal prey organisms supply carnivorous plants with nitrogen, but they also are important sources of various other soluble minerals, such as potassium and trace elements that are in short supply in environments where the plants flourish. This gives them a decisive advantage over other plants, whereas in nutrient-rich soils they tend to be out-competed by plants adapted to aggressive growth where nutrient supplies are not the major constraints.
89_2	CAR_134839bbce1d2ec4d195b566d3d0dc56a3f94b68	Insectivorous plants might consume insects and other animal material trapped  adventitiously , though most species to which such food represents an important part of their intake are specifically, often spectacularly, adapted to attract and secure adequate supplies. Their prey animals typically, but not exclusively, comprise  insect s and other  arthropod s.  Plants highly adapted to reliance on animal food use a variety of mechanisms to secure their prey, such as pitfalls, sticky surfaces, hair-trigger snaps, bladder-traps, entangling furriness, and lobster-pot trap mechanisms. Also known as carnivorous plants, they appear adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients, especially  nitrogen , such as acidic  bog s and rock outcroppings.
89_2	CAR_9445b5664ed3927c6d46c349394b2f908ae57020	The status of the genus as a truly  carnivorous plant  has been repeatedly put into question. In their natural habitat, all species have been observed playing host to live  bug s of the genus  Setocoris , which nourished themselves by eating prey caught by the plants. Following this discovery it was assumed that, as with the genus  Roridula , the plants don't actually digest their prey themselves, rather relying on the bugs to do that. The plants, it was reasoned, benefited by absorbing nutrients from the excrements of the bugs, either through their leaves or through the ground. An indirect digestion of these nutrients by a  chitinase  producing  fungus  was even proposed. It wasn't until 2005 that direct digestion of insect prey by enzymes secreted by the sessile glands of B. filifolia was proven. Soon thereafter similar results were found with B. liniflora. These results clearly place this genus among the true carnivorous plants.
89_2	CAR_e55d9ff6912b53b525e2e519fd2bb3450c32225b	Outdoor-grown carnivorous plants generally catch more than enough insects to keep themselves properly fed. Insects may be fed to the plants by hand to supplement their diet; however, carnivorous plants are generally unable to digest large non-insect food items; bits of hamburger, for example, will simply rot, and this may cause the trap, or even the whole plant, to die.
89_2	CAR_ea3ac6e800ea35766b1f9a3a5f10e7ae9260c4e0	The most obvious interaction between Nepenthes species and their environments, including other organisms, is that of  predator and prey . Nepenthes species certainly attract and kill their prey, albeit passively, through active production of attractive colours, sugary  nectar , and even sweet scents. From this relationship, the plants primarily gain  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  to supplement their nutrient requirements for growth, given these soil nutrients are typically lacking. The most frequent prey is an abundant and diverse group of  arthropod s, with  ant s and other  insect s topping the menu. Other arthropods found frequently include  spider s,  scorpion s, and  centipede s, while  snail s and  frog s are more unusual, but not unheard of. The most uncommon prey for Nepenthes species includes rats found in N. rajah. The composition of prey captured depends on many factors, including location, but can incorporate hundreds of individual insects and many different species. While many Nepenthes species are generalists in what they capture, at least one,  N. albomarginata , has specialised and almost exclusively traps  termite s and produces nearly no nectar. Nepenthes albomarginata gains its name from the ring of white  trichome s directly beneath the peristome. These trichomes—or "hairs"—are palatable to termites and will attract them to the pitcher. In the course of collecting the edible trichomes, hundreds or thousands of termites will fall into the pitcher.

89_2	MARCO_1790250	CARNIVOROUS PLANTS. Meat-eating, or carnivorous, plants can trap and digest insects and other small animals. They do this to obtain the vital nitrogen that they need to grow. Most plants absorb enough nitrogen from nitrates in the soil. Carnivorous plants live in bogs, where nitrates are in short supply, so they need to obtain their nitrogen by digesting prey instead. Carnivorous plants have developed unique ways to catch insects, such as fluid-filled PITCHERS and spring-loaded traps.
89_2	MARCO_1790255	Carnivorous plants. There are more than 600 species of carnivorous plants, according to the Botanical Society of America. They get some of their nutrients by trapping and digesting insects and sometimes, small frogs and mammals. Because the most common prey for most carnivorous plants are insects, they are also called insectivorous plants. While most plants absorb nitrogen from the soil through their roots, carnivorous plants get nitrogen from animals prey that get trapped in their modified leaves. Traps work in various ways. A Venus flytrap, for example, has hinged leaves that snap shut when trigger hairs are touched.

89_2	MARCO_4608868	Q: What do carnivorous plants eat? Dinner! Gross! Hybrid Nepenthes A: It depends on where they live. Many carnivorous plants, such as Utricularia and Aldrovanda, live with their traps submerged in water. These plants capture very small prey like rotifers and daphnia, and even larger aquatic prey such as mosquito larvae and even fish fry. Traps in the genus Genlisea can even capture protozoans, and some scientists think they are specialized specifically to do so!
89_2	MARCO_4608870	Or do you think of plants? Probably not, right? After all, plants aren't the most exciting living things in the world. Or are they? They just sit there and soak up water and nutrients from the soil and the sun, right? Or do some plants do more? Would you believe that there are some plants that eat insects and even small animals from time to time? It's true! We call these exotic things carnivorous plants. Although most carnivorous plants eat small insects, larger carnivorous plants in tropical areas have been known to capture rats, birds, and frogs. One carnivorous plant that many students are familiar with is the Venus flytrap. Its unique â jaws can be triggered by flies and other small insects.

89_3	CAR_22b8b3fa18d9b1f1ba5bc8837323f8173a878d6d	Most carnivorous plants selectively feed on specific prey. This selection is due to the available prey and the type of trap used by the organism. With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods. In fact, the Dionaea diet is 33% ants, 30% spiders, 10% beetles, and 10% grasshoppers, with fewer than 5% flying insects. Given that Dionaea evolved from an ancestral form of Drosera (carnivorous plants that use a sticky trap instead of a snap trap) the reason for this evolutionary branching becomes clear. Whilst Drosera consume smaller, aerial insects, Dionaea consume larger terrestrial bugs. Dionaea are able to extract more nutrients from these larger bugs. This gives Dionaea an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral sticky trap form.
89_3	CAR_351105e2e8ae229daec2d3cefd4ecbce9a431285	The  Venus flytrap , a carnivorous plant, is native to North and South Carolina in the United States. About 33% of the prey of the Venus flytrap are ants of various species. They lure their prey with a sweet sap. Once the prey has entered the trap and within about 3 seconds has touched two or three "trigger hairs", bristles on the surface of the trap, the leaf closes around the prey, confining it behind the "teeth" on its perimeter, and digests it. The majority of ants that were captured included non-native RIFAs, and three other species of ants. Other carnivorous plants, such as sundews ( Drosera ) and various kinds of  pitcher plant s also trap many ants.
89_3	CAR_8af262c01e3c24acec0359c181411f5b6d744f66	The Venus flytrap (also referred to as Venus's flytrap or Venus' flytrap), Dionaea muscipula, is a  carnivorous plant  native to  subtropical   wetland s on the  East Coast  of the  United States  in  North Carolina  and  South Carolina . It catches its prey—chiefly  insect s and  arachnid s—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap closes if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value.

89_3	CAR_a35d1aeb57498d6939da9b85844d401fd8444456	Broadcast 18 January 1995, this programme is about how plants gain their sustenance.  Sunlight  is one of the essential requirements if a seed is to  germinate , and Attenborough highlights the  cheese plant  as an example whose young shoots head for the nearest tree trunk and then climb to the top of the  forest canopy , developing its  leaves  en route. Using sunshine,  air , water and a few  mineral s, the leaves are, in effect, the "factories" that produce food. However, some, such as the  begonia , can thrive without much light. To gain moisture, plants typically use their  root s to probe underground. Trees pump water up pipes that run inside their trunks, and Attenborough observes that a sycamore can do this at the rate of 450 litres an hour — in total silence. Too much rainfall can clog up a leaf's  pore s, and many have specially designed 'gutters' to cope with it. However, their biggest threat is from animals, and some require extreme methods of defence, such as  spine s,  camouflage , or  poison . Some can move quickly to deter predators: the  mimosa  can fold its leaves instantly when touched, and the  Venus flytrap  eats insects by closing its leaves around its prey when triggered. Another carnivorous plant is the  trumpet pitcher  that snares insects when they fall into its tubular leaves. Attenborough visits  Borneo  to see the largest pitcher of them all,  Nepenthes rajah , whose traps contain up to two litres of water and have been known to kill small  rodent s.
89_3	CAR_b2f1316d87bdb954b86558796d02dfb1190a4600	In 2016, a study of the expression of genes in the plant's leaves as they captured and digested prey was published in the journal,  Genome Research . The gene activation observed in the leaves of the plants gives support to the hypothesis that the carnivorous mechanisms present in the flytrap are a specially adapted version of mechanisms used by non-carnivorous plants to defend against herbivorous insects. In many non-carnivorous plants,  jasmonic acid  serves as a signaling molecule for the activation of defense mechanisms, such as the production of hydrolases, which can destroy  chitin  and other molecular components of insect and microbial pests. In the Venus flytrap, this same molecule has been found to be responsible for the activation of the plant's digestive glands. A few hours after the capture of prey, another set of genes is activated inside the glands, the same set of genes that is active in the roots of other plants, allowing them to absorb nutrients. The use of similar biological pathways in the traps as non-carnivorous plants use for other purposes indicates that somewhere in its evolutionary history, the Venus flytrap repurposed these genes for the purpose of carnivory.

About 33% of the prey of the Venus flytrap are ants of various species. They lure their prey with a sweet sap. Once the prey has entered the trap and within about 3 seconds has touched two or three "trigger hairs", bristles on the surface of the trap, the leaf closes around the prey, confining it behind the "teeth" on its perimeter, and digests it. The majority of ants that were captured included non-native RIFAs, and three other species of ants.

89_5	CAR_167cd681b6ee50af7c1a18e69f16dbde04a2a7f9	The Drosera could be considered the 'master of sticky fly paper' because it relies on glandular hairs to trap its prey, then rolls up the edges of the leaf to consume it. These hairs act as a kind of glue that ensnares the prey. This mechanism is comparable to those of other  carnivorous plants  such as the  Venus flytrap  (Dionaea), though the entrapment occurs at a relatively slower rate, and the movement of the enfolding leaves differs. After the prey has been pinned down by the glandular hairs, the stalked glands produce digestive enzymes, including  protease  and  phosphatase  to break down the prey. The digestive fluids work on breaking down the fleshy internal part of the prey into a “nutrient soup” which is then absorbed by the plant. After the digestion and absorption of the prey are complete, the leaf returns to its ready state. The  exoskeleton  of the prey remains on the leaf unless the rainfall washes it away.
89_5	CAR_22b8b3fa18d9b1f1ba5bc8837323f8173a878d6d	Most carnivorous plants selectively feed on specific prey. This selection is due to the available prey and the type of trap used by the organism. With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods. In fact, the Dionaea diet is 33% ants, 30% spiders, 10% beetles, and 10% grasshoppers, with fewer than 5% flying insects. Given that Dionaea evolved from an ancestral form of Drosera (carnivorous plants that use a sticky trap instead of a snap trap) the reason for this evolutionary branching becomes clear. Whilst Drosera consume smaller, aerial insects, Dionaea consume larger terrestrial bugs. Dionaea are able to extract more nutrients from these larger bugs. This gives Dionaea an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral sticky trap form.

89_5	CAR_63dde785ceeb04d980556865906f3edba7294ee0	The more carnivorous a plant is, the less conventional its habitat is likely to be. Venus flytraps live in a very specialised habitat, whereas less carnivorous plants (Byblis, Pinguicula) are found in less unusual habitats (i.e., those typical for non-carnivores). Byblis and Drosophyllum both come from relatively arid regions and are both passive flypapers, arguably the lowest maintenance form of trap. Venus flytraps filter their prey using the teeth around the trap's edge, so as not to waste energy on hard-to-digest prey. In evolution, laziness pays, because energy can be used for reproduction, and short-term benefits in reproduction will outweigh long-term benefits in anything else.

Their trapping mechanism has also been described as a "mouse trap", "bear trap" or "man trap", based on their shape and rapid movement. However, the term snap trap is preferred as other designations are misleading, particularly with respect to the intended prey. Aldrovanda is aquatic and specialised in catching small invertebrates; Dionaea is terrestrial and catches a variety of arthropods, including spiders.

Rapid plant movement can result from actual growth, or from rapid changes in cell  turgor , which allow cells to expand or contract by quickly altering their water content. Slow-moving flypapers like Pinguicula exploit growth, while the Venus flytrap uses such rapid turgor changes which make glue unnecessary. The stalked glands that once made glue became teeth and trigger hairs in Drosera —an example of natural selection  hijacking preexisting structures  for new functions.
89_5	MARCO_1071053	Sprout Home Plant Of The Week: Venus Flytrap. The name Venus Flytrap is a dichotomy. Venus is the goddess of love but the 'flytrap' part of the name indicates otherwise. We bet you're wondering how can it be that a plant can eat prey? It sounds like a science experiment gone awry. The Venus flytrap, botanically named Dionaea muscipula, really does catch and digest animal prey -- primarily insects and spiders. The trap part of the plant that moves to envelop its prey is actually triggered by tiny little hairs on the inside of the trap.
89_5	MARCO_1071054	Watch for the trap to reopen. Once the Venus flytrap closes over its food, it takes at least 12 hours to digest its meal. Digestive enzymes break down the soft inner fluids of the insect or spider, leaving the exoskeleton intact. After about 12 hours, the trap will open and the empty exoskeleton will blow or wash away.
89_5	MARCO_1790250	CARNIVOROUS PLANTS. Meat-eating, or carnivorous, plants can trap and digest insects and other small animals. They do this to obtain the vital nitrogen that they need to grow. Most plants absorb enough nitrogen from nitrates in the soil. Carnivorous plants live in bogs, where nitrates are in short supply, so they need to obtain their nitrogen by digesting prey instead. Carnivorous plants have developed unique ways to catch insects, such as fluid-filled PITCHERS and spring-loaded traps.

89_5	MARCO_6416404	The rapid closure of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) leaf in about 100 ms is one of the fastest movements in the plant kingdom. This led Darwin to describe the plant as 'one of the most wonderful in the world' 1. The trap closure is initiated by the mechanical stimulation of trigger hairs.ost carnivorous plants selectively feed on specific prey. This selection is due to the available prey and the type of trap used by the organism. With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods.

The Venus Fly Trap-is a carnivorous plant.Its leaves form two halves of a hinged 'trap'. When an insect crawls over the surface, it trips 'trigger hairs' on the leaf, which snaps shut in a split-second. The insect is then dissolved by digestive enzymes.

89_5	MARCO_8564341	Trigger Hairs on a Venus Fly Trap. Leaf-base, petiole and trap. Venus fly traps have evolved to become carnivorous due to the fact that the soil that they grow in is lacking or short on certain key nutrients that are fundamental to plant growth. The media (soil) that Venus Fly Traps grow in is nitrogen poor and acidic.Without an ample supply of nitrogen, it is difficult for a plant to synthesize protein, and thus grow. Therefore, in order to supplement their nitrogen supply, Venus fly traps trap and digest insects.rigger Hairs on a Venus Fly Trap. Leaf-base, petiole and trap.

It grows to a height of 3–16 cm, and is topped with a purple, and occasionally white, flower that is 15 mm or longer, and shaped like a funnel. This butterwort grows in damp environments such as bogs and swamps, in low or subalpine elevations. It has a generally circumboreal distribution, being native to almost every country in  Europe  as well as  Russia ,  Canada , and the  United States . Being native to environments with cold winters, they produce a winter-resting bud ( hibernaculum ). There are three forms originating from Europe: P. vulgaris f. bicolor which has petals that are white and purple; P. vulgaris f. albida which has all white petals; and P. vulgaris f. alpicola which has larger flowers. The taxonomic status of these forms is not universally recognised - see e.g. The Plant List.

It includes  black bears ,  red-cockaded woodpecker s, and  orchid s. It is one of the few places to find  Venus flytrap  growing naturally, and  Coastal Carolina University  biology professor James Luken predicted that in South Carolina, where the species once was found in four counties, the Venus flytrap could soon be found only in the preserve.

This is related to apostatic selection because when a rare morph is being selected for, it is going to increase in abundance in a specific population until it becomes recognized by a predator. Prey switching, therefore, seems to be a result of apostatic selection. Prey switching is related to prey preference as well as the abundance of the prey.

The model assumes that predators search for prey at random, and that both predators and prey are assumed to be distributed in a non-contiguous ("clumped") fashion in the environment.
89_7	CAR_07e033999040730a694d5f519b443eb37d5d3b52	The ability of the blue catfish to tolerate a wide range of climates and brackish water has allowed it to thrive in Virginia's rivers, lakes, tributaries, and the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, the relatively low mortality rate, large body size, wide range of species preyed upon, and success as a predator has resulted in the blue catfish being considered a problematic invasive species in Virginia. Since their introduction in Virginia waters in the 1970s, blue catfish populations have exploded. Recent electrofishing studies have presented data suggesting blue catfish make up around 75% of the total fish biomass in the James River. The introduction of blue catfish in the James River has begun to affect several species native to the James, such as the smallmouth bass, which is a native predator in the James River that is greatly outcompeted by the blue catfish for the same food sources. In addition to outcompeting the smallmouth bass for food, the blue catfish also heavily preys on the smallmouth bass.

When both predator and prey are evolving at the same time, and the predator population has drastic effects on prey, the prey may realize they have the ability to overcome smaller numbers of predators and evolve to a predator-type role.
89_7	CAR_10a90d52de0763ca7d00296ab650eb0e0c0c0d0f	According to  Georgia Institute of Technology  research, prey and predator roles have cycles where the prey population may increase, thereby causing the predator population to increase as well. But sometimes the predator population overwhelms the prey to the point of devastating the prey population, subsequently resulting in a devastation of the predator population. Some studies indicate that  the roles of each may become reversed to the point that prey begin to eat the predators.
89_7	CAR_19596e069adf964ba0ea665af46eff436ee73ce2	Tahr are preyed upon by  Himalayan Snow Leopard s. The snow leopards also eat the other ungulate species in the area, which could result in  apparent competition  between the Himalayan tahr and one or more of the other herbivores. Apparent competition can occur when two species share a predator. If an increase in one of the prey species increases the predator population, this can translate into increased predation on the other prey species. This is called apparent competition, because the effect was indirect from the two prey species via the predator species rather than by direct competition of the two prey species for some shared resource.
89_7	CAR_1f3cf66eec6c0341e6e2a1e1fb25af96844b0d44	Apparent competition is actually an example of predation that alters the relative abundances of prey on the same  trophic level . It occurs when two or more species in a  habitat  affect shared natural enemies in a higher  trophic level . If two species share a common  predator , for example, apparent competition can exist between the two prey items in which the presence of each prey species increases the abundance of the shared enemy, and thereby suppresses one or both prey species. This mechanism gets its name from experiments in which one prey species is removed and the second prey species increases in abundance. Investigators sometimes mistakenly attribute the increase in abundance in the second species as evidence for resource competition between prey species. It is "apparently" competition, but is in fact due to a shared predator, parasitoid, parasite, or pathogen.
89_7	CAR_28d3de9979b4a543b46af51f2126de58c5b26b06	Spatial populations of predators and prey show restraint of reproduction at equilibrium, both individually and through social communication, as originally proposed by Wynne-Edwards. While these spatial populations do not have well-defined groups for group selection, the local spatial interactions of organisms in transient groups are sufficient to lead to a kind of multi-level selection. There is however as yet no evidence that these processes operate in the situations where Wynne-Edwards posited them; Rauch et al.'s analysis, for example, is of a host-parasite situation, which was recognised as one where group selection was possible even by  E. O. Wilson  (1975), in a treatise broadly hostile to the whole idea of group selection. Specifically, the parasites do not individually moderate their transmission; rather, more transmissible variants "continually arise and grow rapidly for many generations but eventually go extinct before dominating the system."
89_7	CAR_2a3cb62d10ec724f836245a75492642c80a431d9	Predator-prey populations tend to show  chaotic  behavior within limits, where the sizes of populations change in a way that may appear random, but is in fact obeying  deterministic  laws based only on the relationship between a population and its food source illustrated by the  Lotka–Volterra equation .  An experimental example of this was shown in an eight-year study on small  Baltic Sea  creatures such as  plankton , which were isolated from the rest of the ocean. Each member of the  food web  was shown to take turns multiplying and declining, even though the scientists kept the outside conditions constant. An article in Journal Nature stated; "Advanced mathematical techniques proved the indisputable presence of chaos in this food web ... short-term prediction is possible, but long-term prediction is not."
89_7	CAR_2c95e6d5c9a71264c370398fbfd9b6293c855bb0	The first experiments with  predation  and  spatial heterogeneity  were conducted by  G.F. Gause  in the 1930s, based on the  Lotka-Volterra equation , which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no further application had been conducted. The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested that the relationship between predators and their prey would result in population  oscillations  over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause's early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator–prey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the  population cycle s accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly to the left of the peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker's experiments expanded on those of Gause by examining how both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator–prey oscillations.
89_7	CAR_34b38a6a0b045595319863992a0a4cf3b53a6404	It is fairly clear that predators tend to lower the survival and  fecundity  of their prey, but on a higher level of organization,  population s of predator and prey species also interact. It is obvious that predators depend on prey for survival, and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations. It is not so obvious, however, that predators affect prey populations. Eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its  carrying capacity .
89_7	CAR_355db8cb59786bcbb1287807502ea740051d8ce8	The concept that nature maintains its condition is of ancient provenance;  Herodotus  commented on the wonderful relationship between predator and prey species, which remained in a steady proportion to one another, with predators never excessively consuming their prey populations. The "balance of nature" concept once ruled ecological research, as well as once governing the management of natural resources. This led to a  doctrine  popular among some  conservationist s that nature was best left to its own devices, and that  human  intervention into it was by definition unacceptable.
89_7	CAR_41ccf9eb76bffa961048a7d394841a101f539c82	Naultinus are preyed on by a number of invasive mammalian species including cats,  rodent s (3 species of rat and the  house mouse ) and mustelids. While the larger predators such as  stoat s and cats are the normal focus of pest control efforts in New Zealand, it is thought that the effect that smaller predators such as mice and  weasel s may be just as great or even worse. After the removal of mice from Mana Island in the '90s, lizard numbers increased massively – demonstrating that mouse predation does serious harm to native reptile populations. Mice can squeeze into much smaller hiding places to take lizards as prey and they also forage year round, no matter how cold it gets - this is significant because below 5 degrees Celsius lizards become  torpid  and can't defend themselves against attack. This would mean that Naultinus sheltering from cold weather on the ground at the base of plants or underneath debris would be particularly vulnerable to mouse predation. In addition to being preyed on by certain species of invasive mammals, Naultinus are also preyed on by introduced bird species -  mynas  have been observed plucking Naultinus from the forest canopy in parts of Northland and  magpies  have been observed searching scrub canopies in a similar fashion at known Naultinus sites in the South Island.
89_7	CAR_479e6fee8809d7953706455efe030e07ab3f55f5	Nesting colonies attracted large numbers of predators, including  American mink s,  American weasel s,  American marten s, and  raccoon s that preyed on eggs and nestlings,  birds of prey , such as  owl s,  hawk s, and  eagle s that preyed on nestlings and adults, and  wolves ,  fox es,  bobcat s,  bear s, and  mountain lion s that preyed on injured adults and fallen nestlings. Hawks of the genus  Accipiter  and falcons pursued and preyed upon pigeons in flight, which in turn executed complex aerial maneuvers to avoid them;  Cooper's hawk  was known as the "great pigeon hawk" due to its successes, and these hawks allegedly followed migrating passenger pigeons. While many predators were drawn to the flocks, individual pigeons were largely protected due to the sheer size of the flock, and overall little damage could be inflicted on the flock by predation. Despite the number of predators, nesting colonies were so large that they were estimated to have a 90% success rate if not disturbed. After being abandoned and leaving the nest, the very fat juveniles were vulnerable to predators until they were able to fly. The sheer number of juveniles on the ground meant that only a small percentage of them were killed;  predator satiation  may therefore be one of the reasons for the extremely social habits and communal breeding of the species.
89_7	CAR_4a054382b6523bb7884e7e64ad84201ed36872ae	The numerical response in  ecology  is the change in  predator  density as a function of change in prey density. The term numerical response was coined by M. E. Solomon in 1949. It is associated with the  functional response , which is the change in predator's rate of prey consumption with change in prey density. As Holling notes, total predation can be expressed as a combination of functional and numerical response. The numerical response has two mechanisms: the demographic response and the aggregational response. The numerical response is not necessarily proportional to the change in prey density, usually resulting in a time lag between prey and predator populations. For example, there is often a scarcity of predators when the prey population is increasing.

These provide a  mathematical model  for the cycling of predator and prey populations. Predators tend to select young, weak, and ill individuals.
89_7	CAR_5ecadf25a7487a8b27d773ec69f5b351d41a43e4	Intraguild predation is common in nature and widespread across communities and ecosystems.  Intraguild predators must share at least one prey species and usually occupy the same trophic  guild , and the degree of IGP depends on factors such as the size, growth, and population density of the predators, as well as the population density and behavior of their shared prey.  When creating theoretical models for intraguild predation, the competing species are classified as the "top predator" or the "intermediate predator," (the species more likely to be preyed upon).  In theory, intraguild predation is most stable if the top predator benefits strongly from feeding on the intermediate predator, and if the intermediate predator is a better competitor for the shared prey resource.
89_7	CAR_687e2f172136457f76c7446807568880b361fb90	Apex predators affect prey species' population dynamics. Where two competing species are in an ecologically unstable relationship, apex predators tend to create stability if they prey upon both. Inter-predator relationships are also affected by apex status. Non-native fish, for example, have been known to devastate formerly dominant predators. One lake manipulation study found that when the non-native  smallmouth bass  was removed,  lake trout , the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its  trophic level .
89_7	CAR_6fa13d64c4cad0f3fe911f03ed34036b797c61e2	Predator–prey  interactions exhibit natural oscillations in the populations of both predator and the prey. In 1925, the  American  mathematician  Alfred J. Lotka  developed simple equations for predator–prey interactions in his book on biomathematics. The following year, the Italian mathematician  Vito Volterra , made a statistical analysis of fish catches in the Adriatic and independently developed the same equations. It is one of the earliest and most recognised ecological models, known as the  Lotka-Volterra model :
89_7	CAR_75c474e58bdb728896fb0bd474a0f5138846a2d8	Predator–prey reversal is a biological interaction where an organism that is typically prey in the  predation  interaction instead  acts as the predator. A variety of interactions are considered a  role reversal .One type is where the prey confronts its predator and the interaction ends with no feeding. Two competing predators may interact and the larger predator will prey on the smaller. Smaller organisms may prey on larger organisms. Changing  population densities  may trigger a role reversal. In addition, adult prey may attack juvenile predators.
89_7	CAR_76bdc8b8cfef856c7d7cb4593b45e89e2bf4d671	The  Lotka–Volterra  predator–prey model describes the basic population dynamics under predation. The solution to these equations in the simple one-predator species, one-prey species model is a stable linked oscillation of population levels for both predator and prey. However, when time lags between respective population growths are modeled, these oscillations will tend to amplify, eventually leading to extinction of both species. The  Ricker model  exemplifies this dynamic. 
89_7	CAR_85d12960c22ad6ec8cff605ab3b44d05b1d0ec6b	It has been proven that adaptive behavior is crucial in the process of  natural selection , and thus is important in the  evolutionary process . Species that possess positive adaptive behaviors will inherently acquire evolutionary advantages. For example, adaptive behavior is a mechanism of  population stabilization . In natural communities, organisms are able to interact with each other creating complex  food webs  and  predator-prey dynamics . Adaptive behavior helps modulate the dynamics of feeding relationships by having a direct effect on their feeding  trait s and strategies. These adaptive behaviors allow for resilience and resistance in the face of  disturbance s and a changing environment. In  ecology , the coexistence of  organisms  in natural ecosystems and the stability of populations are central topics. Currently, we live in a world experiencing great changes at a fast rate, mostly due to  anthropogenic  impacts on organisms and the environment. By studying adaptive behavior one can understand  ecosystem  complexity – how it emerges, how it evolves, and how it can be maintained.
89_7	CAR_86b7f5bdf2a846b09612b09853f67e85efaf2101	Several factors play into these fluctuating populations and help stabilize predator–prey dynamics. For example, spatial heterogeneity is maintained, which means there will always be pockets of plants not found by herbivores. This stabilizing dynamic plays an especially important role for specialist herbivores that feed on one species of plant and prevents these specialists from wiping out their food source.  Prey defenses also help stabilize predator–prey dynamics, and for more information on these relationships see the section on Plant Defenses.  Eating a second prey type helps herbivores’ populations stabilize.  Alternating between two or more plant types provides population stability for the herbivore, while the populations of the plants oscillate.  This plays an important role for generalist herbivores that eat a variety of plants.  Keystone herbivores keep vegetation populations in check and allow for a greater diversity of both herbivores and plants.  When an invasive herbivore or plant enters the system, the balance is thrown off and the diversity can collapse to a monotaxon system.
89_7	CAR_87e05c6e2da48eb62117c3489cf28debe0547fcc	Predator partitioning occurs when species are attacked differently by different predators (or  natural enemies  more generally).  For example, trees could differentiate their niche if they are consumed by different species of  specialist herbivores , such as herbivorous insects.  If a species density declines, so too will the density of its natural enemies, giving it an advantage.  Thus, if each species is constrained by different natural enemies, they will be able to coexist.  Early work focused on specialist predators; however, more recent studies have shown that predators do not need to be pure specialists, they simply need to affect each prey species differently.  The  Janzen–Connell hypothesis  represents a form of predator partitioning.
89_7	CAR_8ce498048524f1208e63b4cf559d3abcbee67797	When the prey are numerous, predators can reproduce rapidly. But this increase in turn increases the number of prey hunted and the population of the prey decreases. By becoming rarer prey, predators begin to starve and die of starvation, decreasing their population and easing the pressure on hunting prey. The prey (and in time predator) can then go back to rapidly reproducing as the cycle repeats itself.
89_7	CAR_8d79670976151e93099372dee82e7c1da2866d6e	Here f(N) captures any change in the prey population not due to predator activity including inherent  birth  and  death rates . The per capita effect of predators on the prey population (the harvest rate) is modeled by a function g which is a function of the  ratio  N/P of prey to predators. Predators receivea a reproductive payoff, e, for consuming prey, and die at rate u. Making predation pressure a function of the ratio of prey to predators contrasts with the prey dependent  Lotka–Volterra equations , where the effect of predators on the prey population is simply a function of the magnitude of the prey population g(N). Because the number of prey harvested by each predator decreases as predators become more  dense , ratio dependent predation represents an example of a  trophic function . Ratio dependent predation may account for  heterogeneity   in large-scale natural systems in which predator efficiency decreases when prey is scarce. The merit of ratio dependent versus prey dependent models of predation has been the subject of much controversy, especially between the biologists  Lev R. Ginzburg  and Peter A. Abrams. Ginzburg purports that ratio dependent models more accurately depict predator-prey interactions while Abrams maintains that these models make unwarranted complicating assumptions.
89_7	CAR_92d0405275bee1e39da54c2979e0d46b5eb4cb09	According to the theory of predator–prey interactions, the relationship between herbivores and plants is cyclic.  When prey (plants) are numerous their predators (herbivores) increase in numbers, reducing the prey population, which in turn causes predator number to decline. The prey population eventually recovers, starting a new cycle.  This suggests that the population of the herbivore fluctuates around the carrying capacity of the food source, in this case the plant.
89_7	CAR_9845eed45b28dff6eb5bf9b5fbf580eb72ee214d	Pursuit predation revolves around a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move to find new foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships can be used as support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also  metapopulation  persistence.
89_7	CAR_a005fafeaadca8b8e61c114071cb4fea9d7774ff	The Eurasian lynx inhabits rugged forested country providing plenty of hideouts and stalking opportunities. Depending on the locality, this may include forest-steppe,  boreal forest , and  montane forest . In the more mountainous parts of their range, Eurasian lynx will descend into the lowlands in winter, following their prey, and avoiding the deepest snows. They tend to be less common where  wolves  are abundant, and wolves have been reported to attack and even eat lynx. In Russian forests, the most important predators of the Eurasian lynx are the  grey wolf  and the  wolverine . Wolves kill and eat lynxes that fail to escape into trees. Lynx populations decrease when wolves appear in a region and are likely to take smaller prey where wolves are active. Wolverines are perhaps the most dogged of competitors for kills, often  stealing  lynx kills. Lynxes tend to actively avoid encounters with wolverines, but may sometimes fight them if defending kittens. Sometimes,  Siberian tiger s have also preyed on lynxes, as evidenced by examination of tiger stomach contents. Lynx compete for food with the predators described above, and also with the  red fox ,  eagle owl s,  golden eagle s,  wild boar  (which scavenge from lynx kills), and in the southern part of its range, the  snow leopard  and  leopard  as well.

He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of  spatial heterogeneity  and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.

The species is native to the inland  Finger Lakes  and  Lake Champlain  in  New York  and  Vermont . It is not clear whether it is native to  Lake Ontario , where it was first noticed in the 1830s, or whether it was introduced through the  Erie Canal  which opened in 1825. Improvements to the  Welland Canal  in 1919 are thought to have allowed its spread from Lake Ontario to  Lake Erie , and while it was never abundant in either lake, it soon spread to  Lake Michigan ,  Lake Huron , and  Lake Superior , where it decimated indigenous fish populations in the 1930s and 1940s. They have created a problem with their aggressive parasitism on key predator species and game fish, such as  lake trout ,  lake whitefish ,  chub , and  lake herring . Elimination of these predators allowed the  alewife , another invasive species, to explode in population, having adverse effects on many native fish species. The lake trout plays a vital role in the Lake Superior ecosystem. The lake trout is considered an  apex predator , which means that they have no predators of their own. The sea lamprey is an aggressive predator by nature, which gives it a competitive advantage in a lake system where it has no predators and its prey lacks defenses against it. The sea lamprey played a large role in the destruction of the Lake Superior lake trout population. Lamprey introduction along with poor, unsustainable fishing practices caused the lake trout populations to decline drastically. The relationship between predators and prey in the Great Lakes' ecosystem then became unbalanced.

Most prey are consumed by more than one predator, and most predators have more than one prey. Their relationships are also influenced by other environmental factors.  In most cases, if one species is removed from an ecosystem, other species will most likely be affected, up to the point of extinction.
89_7	CAR_d5cc3c0e4ba858a16b05332bb5338528904ffd14	This model is typical for revealing the dynamics of populations. As long as the population of the prey is on the rise, the predators population also rises, since they have enough to eat. But very soon the population of the predators becomes too large so that the hunting exceeds the recreation of the prey. This leads to a decrease in the prey’s population and as a consequence of this also to a decrease of predators population as they do not have enough food to feed the entire population.
89_7	CAR_e59df9d22a5f8556a2989cf15c1f34c4d50a8141	Among predators there is a large degree of specialization. Many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey. Others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything (examples:  human s,  leopard s,  dog s and  alligator s). The specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey. The prey in turn, are often equally suited to escape that predator. This is called an  evolutionary arms race  and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium. Some predators specialize in certain classes of prey, not just single species. Some will switch to other prey (with varying degrees of success) when the preferred target is extremely scarce, and they may also resort to  scavenging  or a herbivorous diet if possible.

The conclusion of this experiment showed that roles between species can reverse when the usual prey populations decrease to significantly low levels, causing the predators to decrease in population size also. Once this occurs, prey then begin to build up their population numbers and as they do, they prey on their original predators.

89_7	CAR_fadcdc3dc3e5f1fd0a6f8b270f6e4a22ac0fdaa9	Huffaker’s experimental universes showed that while under many circumstances predator–prey interactions will lead to extinction of both populations, interactions of spatial heterogeneity, dispersal ability of predator and prey species, and distribution of food sources can create an environment in which predator and prey species can coexist.  The distribution of one prey species placed on each of 120 oranges, the impediments to predator movement created by the petroleum jelly divisions between sections of oranges, and the dispersal aid of wooden sticks for the prey species, all worked together to create a spatially heterogeneous environment in which both the predator and prey species survived for three population cycles. Huffaker ultimately concluded that, with added spatial heterogeneity, these mite populations could have continued to oscillate beyond three cycles. Looking forward, Huffaker noted the importance of understanding these concepts with respect to understanding the impact of monocultures (i.e. low spatial heterogeneity) in industrial agriculture on biodiversity.

In its simplest form, growth of the prey population is the product of three factors: population size, growth rate, and a correction term.The larger the population size, the faster the population grows.rey loss due to predation is determined by the relative densities of the two populations as well as the maximum predation rate (u) and the predator satiation constant (c). The predator satiation constant reflects how hungry the predators are by regulating how quickly the maximum predation rate is reached.

They are an important factor in the ecology of populations, determining mortality of prey and birth of new predators.Predation is an important evolutionary force: natural selection favors more effective predators and more evasive prey.ften a predator eats more than one prey. If a predator switches between prey A and B on the basis of their frequency, it will eat A when B is rare and B when A is rare. The prey should exhibit mild oscillations, and the predator should fluctuate little. This would stabilize prey abundances.

Young predators are at risk from members of their own species and competitors, and they may also be vulnerable to adults of prey species, as young predators pose nearly no predation risk to adult prey. An experiment where juvenile prey were exposed to adult predators while they developed were more likely to kill juvenile predators as adults than prey that was not exposed as juveniles. Increased levels of attack against juvenile predators can deter the adult predators, as the adult predators will avoid locations where their young may be attacked. This in turn reduces the risk of predation on the prey species.

A variety of interactions are considered a  role reversal .One type is where the prey confronts its predator and the interaction ends with no feeding. Two competing predators may interact and the larger predator will prey on the smaller. Smaller organisms may prey on larger organisms. Changing  population densities  may trigger a role reversal.

This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers may be able to predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.

They lure their amphibian predators by making prey-like movements, then evade the predator's attack and disable the predator, often with a bite to the throat or underside. After the attack, the larva stays attached to the amphibian while feeding on it, similarly to  external parasites . Adult Epomis beetles are  generalist  predators but can also feed on amphibians. They sneak up behind their victims, and hold on firmly using their legs. To paralyze the victim, the beetle makes an incision in the pelvic region with its mandibles. There is speculation that the incision cuts leg muscles. The amphibian loses its ability to move and is eaten by the beetle. Scientists speculate that Epomis evolved this behavior as an aggressive evasion tactic in response to  predation  by amphibians and the success of this tactic led to Epomis becoming an obligate predator itself.

Two species of Epomis ( E. circumscriptus  and  E. dejeani ) use the amphibian’s  predation  behavior to their advantage by luring the amphibian to them. “The Epomis larva combines a sit-and-wait strategy with unique movements of its antennae and mandibles to draw the attention of the amphibian to the presence of a potential prey.” Out of 400 tests, the larvae avoided the amphibian’s tongue, and counterattacks by attaching itself to the body of the amphibian with an approximate 98% success rate.

It is possible the Janzen–Connell hypothesis is applicable only for some species depending on species characteristics.

89_9	CAR_1ea7529aac13499cc1d5e2eac992cc2f18b46e56	The ecological effects of intraguild predation include direct effects on the survival and distribution of the competing predators, as well as indirect effects on the abundance and distribution of prey species and other species within the community.  Because they are so common, IGP interactions are important in structuring communities.  Intraguild predation may actually benefit the shared prey species by lowering overall predation pressure, particularly if the intermediate predator consumes more of the shared prey.  Intraguild predation can also dampen the effects of  trophic cascade s by providing redundancy in predation: if one predator is removed from the ecosystem, the other is still consuming the same prey species. Asymmetrical IGP can be a particularly strong influence on habitat selection.  Often, intermediate predators will avoid otherwise optimal habitat because of the presence of the top predator. Behavioral changes in intermediate predator distribution due to increased risk of predation can influence community structure more than direct mortality caused by the top predators.

It is widely acknowledged that environmental health is important to human health, and biodiversity loss can have both indirect and direct negative effects on human wellbeing. The close link between human health and ecological/faunal health is substantiated with five important concepts: animals cause and disseminate disease for humans and vice versa, animals can be guards of human health, animals are used in traditional medicine practices throughout the world, animals are a source of drugs and treatments in human diseases, and animals are used in medical research.
89_9	CAR_2a1c0d3d13052acf8c6a9ef26b4006b7c4b25337	An ecological cascade effect is a series of secondary  extinction s that is triggered by the primary extinction of a key  species  in an  ecosystem .  Secondary extinctions are likely to occur when the threatened species are: dependent on a few specific food sources,  mutualistic  (dependent on the key species in some way), or forced to coexist with an  invasive species  that is introduced to the ecosystem. Species introductions to a foreign ecosystem can often devastate entire communities, and even entire ecosystems. These exotic species monopolize the ecosystem’s resources, and since they have no natural predators to decrease their growth, they are able to increase indefinitely. Olsen et al. showed that exotic species have caused lake and  estuary  ecosystems to go through cascade effects due to loss of  alga e,  crayfish ,  mollusk s, fish,  amphibian s, and birds.  However, the principal cause of cascade effects is the loss of top  predator s as the key species. As a result of this loss, a dramatic increase ( ecological release ) of  prey  species occurs. The prey is then able to  overexploit  its own food resources, until the population numbers decrease in abundance, which can lead  to extinction. When the prey’s food resources disappear, they starve and may go extinct as well. If the prey species is  herbivorous , then their initial release and exploitation of the plants may result in a loss of plant  biodiversity  in the area. If other  organism s in the ecosystem also depend upon these plants as food resources, then these species may go extinct as well. An example of the cascade effect caused by the loss of a top predator is apparent in  tropical forests . When hunters cause local extinctions of top predators, the predators’ prey's population numbers increase, causing an overexploitation of a food resource and a cascade effect of species loss. Recent studies have been performed on approaches to mitigate extinction cascades in food-web networks.
89_9	CAR_31854018683a0d1866a7f9244367ff7595053733	Community genetics is a recently emerged field in biology that fuses elements of  community ecology ,  evolutionary biology , and  molecular  and  quantitative genetics . Antonovics first articulated the vision for such a field, and Whitham et al. formalized its definition as “The study of the genetic interactions that occur between species and their  abiotic environment  in complex communities.” The field aims to bridge the gaps in the study of  evolution  and  ecology , within the multivariate community context that ecological and evolutionary phenomena are embedded within. The documentary movie A Thousand Invisible Cords provides an introduction to the field and its implications.	To date, the primary focus of most community genetics studies has been on the influences of genetic variation in plants on foliar arthropod communities. In a wide variety of ecosystems, different plant genotypes often support different compositions of associated foliar arthropod communities. Such community phenotypes have been observed in natural hybrid complexes, among genotypes and sibling families within a single species and among different plant populations. To understand the broader impacts of differences among plant genotypes on biodiversity as a whole, researchers have begun to examine the response of other organisms, such as foliar endophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, soil microbes, litter dwelling arthropods, herbaceous plants and epiphytes. These effects are frequently examined with foundation species in temperate ecosystems, who structure ecosystems by modulating and stabilizing resources and ecosystem processes. The emphasis on foundation species allows researchers to focus on the likely most important players in a system without becoming overwhelmed by the complexity of all the genetically variable interactions occurring at the same time. However, unique effects of plant genotypes have also been found with non-foundation species, and can occur in tropical, boreal and alpine systems.The vision for the field of community genetics extends beyond documentation of different communities on different genotypes of a focal species. Other aspects of this field include understanding how species interactions within a community are modulated by host genotype, implications of host genotype on the fitness and evolution of community members, and selection on hosts influencing associated communities. Future progress in the field of community genetics is strongly dependent on breakthroughs of modern molecular DNA-based technology, such as genome sequencing. The application of a community genetics approach to understanding how species and communities of interacting organisms are reacting to rapid changes in climate, as well as informing restoration, are two important applied aspects of community genetics.
89_9	CAR_34b38a6a0b045595319863992a0a4cf3b53a6404	It is fairly clear that predators tend to lower the survival and  fecundity  of their prey, but on a higher level of organization,  population s of predator and prey species also interact. It is obvious that predators depend on prey for survival, and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations. It is not so obvious, however, that predators affect prey populations. Eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its  carrying capacity .
89_9	CAR_3897a7f2d36a70b487515f3aeb4bf54efca4bf38	Another example of a multi-trophic interaction is a  trophic cascade , in which predators help to increase plant growth and prevent  overgrazing  by suppressing herbivores. Links in a food-web illustrate direct trophic relations among species, but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution, or biomass in the trophic levels. For example, predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants. Although the predators do not eat the plants directly, they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism. The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called trophic cascades. Trophic cascades are separated into species-level cascades, where only a subset of the food-web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers, and community-level cascades, where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food-web, such as the distribution of plant biomass.
89_9	CAR_3aeff5021142adb374072cf2d275eeceb541051f	One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single  trophic level . That is, they are concerned with only one level of the  food web , namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see  keystone species ). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak  interaction s between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable. If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less  biomass  in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist  consumption  and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first. Lastly, it has recently been shown that  consumers  can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone. Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.
89_9	CAR_507f0cea4db3a241d15490bb1cc24f02a17c46e8	The significant population loss of fauna species in the Jarrah Forest is attributed to the fox and cat ( felis catus ). Predators can influence abundances and ranges of species at all trophic levels, including primary producers, prey and other predators. Between 1933 and 1944 the terrestrial range of the quokka ( Setonix brachyurus ), the woylie, the chuditch, the brushtail possum, the western ringtail possum, the tammar wallaby and the numbat contracted quite dramatically. This was blamed on the fox. Population numbers, however, of woylies and boodies were already declining in 1911, most likely due to cats ( Felis catus ) introduced by Europeans. Another introduced species that is a major threat to birds in some areas of the Jarrah Forest, but for a very different reason, is the feral bee ( Apis mellifera ). Swarms of feral bees take over tree hollows, stealing the nesting sites of hollow-nesting birds.
89_9	CAR_5116ed1ab14a3f951ec63479d1eaede31ea03898	All organisms are connected to each other through feeding interactions. That is, if a species eats or is eaten by another species, they are connected in an intricate  food web  of predator and prey interactions. The stability of these interactions has been a long-standing question in ecology. That is to say, if certain individuals are removed, what happens to the network (i.e. does it collapse or adapt)? Network analysis can be used to explore food web stability and determine if certain network properties result in more stable networks. Moreover, network analysis can be used to determine how selective removals of species will influence the food web as a whole. This is especially important considering the potential species loss due to global climate change.
89_9	CAR_5172f91789262d6655c6d7231f9ee9da75178cd6	Seemingly the paradox can be accounted for by the indirect effects of harvesting on the native ecological interactions of prey and predator: reduction of intraspecific density effect for the prey and reduction of the reproductive rate for the predator. The former increases the population recovery of the prey, and the latter decreases the equilibrium population level for the predator.
89_9	CAR_575667c82e2210379d13c4f74e0b137487cb4f09	Conservation biology  was originally conceptualized as a crisis-oriented discipline, with the goal of providing principles and tools for preserving biodiversity. This is a branch of biology that is concerned with preserving genetic variation in plants and animals. This scientific field evolved to study the complex problems surrounding habitat destruction and species protection. The objectives of conservation biologists are to understand how humans affect biodiversity and to provide potential solutions that benefit both humans and non-human species. It is understood in this field that there are underlying fields of biology that could readily help to have a better understanding and contribute to conservation of biodiversity. Biological knowledge alone is not sufficient to solve conservation problems, and the role of the social sciences in solving these problems has become increasingly important. With the knowledge of conservation biology combined with other fields, much was thought to be gained. Psychology is defined as the scientific study of human thought, feeling, and behavior. Psychology was one of the fields that could take its concepts and apply them to conservation. It was also always understood that in the field of psychology there could be much aid to be given, the field only had to be developed. Psychology can help in providing insight into moral reasoning and moral functioning, which lie in the heart of human–nature relationships. Everyone that is now involved from the field of psychology had knowledge of ways to conceptualize the relationship of humans to their environment. Biology has always been involved in advances of conservation considering biodiversity, and the organisms in it are part of the main field of biology. Psychology has been absent from conservation for some time, but educators and scientists are realizing that with the help of both we can come to a better understanding of humans and their social interactions with their environment and everything in it.
89_9	CAR_5bf508f30d475b12d1a66f6fc180d77d17c22d1c	Predatory large mammals are important for increasing overall diversity by making sure that smaller predators and herbivores do not become overabundant and dominate. Absence of large predators seems to result in uneven densities of prey species. Even though certain animals may not have become completely extinct, they may have lowered in numbers to the point that they have suffered an ecological extinction. The animals that have most likely suffered an  ecological extinction  in neotropical forests are the ones who are the most important predators, large seed dispersers, and seed predators.
89_9	CAR_5c883442377749587f06d3632e695969c6e4567c	This theory postulates that multicellularity arose as a means for prey to escape predation. Larger prey are less likely to be preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that multicellularity arose when the first predators evolved. By assembling as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore multicellularity was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory  protist , Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a prey population of  Chlorella  vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting because before the predator was introduced, the  population  of  Chlorella  vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal species retained a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular.
89_9	CAR_6133b235d61645802eabbf260f168f173a6f6a05	Predators may increase the  biodiversity  of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant. Such predators are known as  keystone species  and may have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular  ecosystem .  Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem. For example, grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over.
89_9	CAR_687e2f172136457f76c7446807568880b361fb90	Apex predators affect prey species' population dynamics. Where two competing species are in an ecologically unstable relationship, apex predators tend to create stability if they prey upon both. Inter-predator relationships are also affected by apex status. Non-native fish, for example, have been known to devastate formerly dominant predators. One lake manipulation study found that when the non-native  smallmouth bass  was removed,  lake trout , the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its  trophic level .
89_9	CAR_71dbb817ce1c6fe4312fda33a322d546ab6b1af4	The Unified Theory unifies biodiversity, as measured by species-abundance curves, with biogeography, as measured by species-area curves. Species-area relationships show the rate at which species diversity increases with area.  The topic is of great interest to conservation biologists in the design of reserves, as it is often desired to harbour as many species as possible.
89_9	CAR_77656cd946466db5b62f7c2bd7b4840b8f8f5ca6	The Janzen–Connell hypothesis is a widely accepted explanation for the maintenance of  tree   species   biodiversity  in  tropical rainforests .  It was published independently in the early 1970s by  Daniel Janzen  and  Joseph Connell . According to their hypothesis,  host -specific  herbivores ,  pathogens , or other  natural enemies  (often referred to as  predators ) make the areas near a parent tree (the seed producing tree) inhospitable for the survival of seedlings.  These natural enemies are referred to as 'distance-responsive predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings near the parent tree, or 'density-dependent predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings where they are most abundant (which is typically near the parent tree). Such predators can prevent any one species from dominating the landscape, because if that species is too common, there will be few safe places for its seedlings to survive.  However, because the predators are host-specific (also called  specialists ), they will not harm other tree species.  As a result, if a species becomes very rare, then more predator-free areas will become available, giving that species' seedlings a competitive advantage.  This negative feedback allows the tree species to coexist, and can be classified as a  stabilizing mechanism .
89_9	CAR_86b7f5bdf2a846b09612b09853f67e85efaf2101	Several factors play into these fluctuating populations and help stabilize predator–prey dynamics. For example, spatial heterogeneity is maintained, which means there will always be pockets of plants not found by herbivores. This stabilizing dynamic plays an especially important role for specialist herbivores that feed on one species of plant and prevents these specialists from wiping out their food source.  Prey defenses also help stabilize predator–prey dynamics, and for more information on these relationships see the section on Plant Defenses.  Eating a second prey type helps herbivores’ populations stabilize.  Alternating between two or more plant types provides population stability for the herbivore, while the populations of the plants oscillate.  This plays an important role for generalist herbivores that eat a variety of plants.  Keystone herbivores keep vegetation populations in check and allow for a greater diversity of both herbivores and plants.  When an invasive herbivore or plant enters the system, the balance is thrown off and the diversity can collapse to a monotaxon system.
89_9	CAR_9845eed45b28dff6eb5bf9b5fbf580eb72ee214d	Pursuit predation revolves around a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move to find new foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships can be used as support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also  metapopulation  persistence.
89_9	CAR_9af9887fc18f48612876e59ace9e36e5fbe80dd5	After the  Earth Summit  in Rio, 1992 and the adoption of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the term  biodiversity  has become a component of research policy in many countries and international bodies and initiatives. Biodiversity however, is not a concept but an umbrella term (Haila and Kouki 1994); the content of which is quite diverse as can be inferred by definitions provided in many different texts (Wilson 1988, Reid and Miller 1989, CBD 1992, Margalef 1997). The distinction between  diversity  and  biodiversity  is also fairly unclear in many studies in  biology .As with most other issues in  Ecology  and  Evolution , paradigms dominating the study of biodiversity on both global and regional scales come mainly from the  terrestrial  environment despite the marked distinctive features of  marine  biodiversity and the fact that the  aquatic  ( freshwater  &  marine ) environment occupies more than two thirds of the Earth’s surface (Vanaverbeke et al. 1997, Gessner et al. 2004). Marine organisms play crucial roles in many bio-geochemical processes that sustain the biosphere, and provide a variety of products and functions which are essential to mankind’s well-being, including the production of food and natural substances, the assimilation of waste and regulation of the world’s climate. The rate and efficiency of any processes that marine organisms mediate, as well as the range of goods and services that they provide, are determined by interactions between organisms and interactions between organisms and their environment; and therefore by biodiversity (Gaston 1996, Gaston and Spicer 1998). These relationships have not yet been quantified, and we are at present unable to predict the consequences of loss of biodiversity resulting from environmental change in ecological, economic or social terms (Walker, 1992, Lawton and Brown, 1994, Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 1981, Lawton, 1994, Vitousek and Hooper 1994). The influence of species diversity on the productivity of marine ecosystems on a large scale is still unclear (Cardinale et al. 2004).
89_9	CAR_abfa25a66ec138a7691d74ae35b9fd6282bdd7d6	Biotic hypotheses claim ecological species interactions such as competition, predation, mutualism, and parasitism are stronger in the tropics and these interactions promote species coexistence and specialization of species, leading to greater speciation in the tropics. These hypotheses are problematic because they cannot be the proximate cause of the latitudinal diversity gradient as they fail to explain why species interactions might be stronger in the tropics.   An example of one such hypothesis is the greater intensity of predation and more specialized predators in the tropics has contributed to the increase of diversity in the tropics (Pianka 1966).  This intense predation could reduce the importance of competition (see competitive exclusion) and permit greater niche overlap and promote higher richness of prey.  However, as discussed above, even if predation is more intense in the tropics (which is not certain), as it cannot be the ultimate cause of species diversity in the tropics because it fails to explain what gives rise to the richness of the predators in the tropics.
89_9	CAR_b836fdaa201dcc7be2ccef626a2b412795cedf86	Evolutionary ecology lies at the intersection of  ecology  and  evolutionary biology . It approaches the study of ecology in a way that explicitly considers the evolutionary histories of species and the interactions between them. Conversely, it can be seen as an approach to the study of evolution that incorporates an understanding of the interactions between the species under consideration. The main subfields of evolutionary ecology are  life history evolution ,  sociobiology  (the  evolution  of social  behavior ), the evolution of interspecific relations ( cooperation ,  predator–prey interactions ,  parasitism ,  mutualism ) and the evolution of  biodiversity  and of  communities .
89_9	CAR_bbf8aa7a0db8af42f5572a39178b8a000e6d7a53	Facilitation of non-native species, either by native species or other non-native species, may increase the invasibility of a community, or the ease with which non-native species become established in a community. In an examination of 254 published studies of  introduced species , 22 of 190 interactions studied between introduced species in the studies were facilitative. It is worth noting that 128 of the 190 examined interactions were  predator–prey  relationships of a single plant-eating insect reported in a single study, which may have overemphasized the importance of negative interactions. Introduced plants are also facilitated by native pollinators,  disperser s, and  mycorrhizae . Thus, positive interactions must be considered in any attempt to understand the invasibility of a community.
89_9	CAR_be83ed86c85a032fdfaf99b889a2883ce5661c85	Ecological fitting can influence species diversity either by promoting diversification through genetic drift, or by maintaining evolutionary  stasis  through  gene flow . Research has shown that ecological fitting can result in parasite assemblages that are just as diverse as those created over evolutionary time, indicating the importance of ecological factors for biodiversity. Ecological fitting can contribute to 3 types of evolutionary transition. The first is simple ecological fitting, in which organisms track resources to form novel species interactions and increase individual fitness.  The second is a shift from an organism's ancestral ecology to a derived ecology, or a more true form of ecological fitting: traits are  exapted  from their original purpose to increase fitness.  Finally, a more dramatic form involves the creation of new evolutionary arenas, requiring morphological or ecological changes to gain fitness under new conditions.  Any of these processes can promote  speciation  or diversification under the right circumstances.  Each form of ecological fitting can encourage speciation only if the population is sufficiently isolated from other populations to prevent  gene flow  from swamping local adaptation to newly formed species associations. Host-plant or other specialized relationships have been previously regarded as an evolutionary 'dead-end' because they seem to limit diversity, but they can actually promote it according to coevolutionary theory. Insects that feed on plants induce them to develop new defense mechanisms, which frees them from  herbivory .  In this new adaptive zone, or  ecospace , plant clades can undergo  evolutionary radiation , in which diversification of the clade occurs quickly due to adaptive change. The herbivorous insects may eventually succeed in adapting to the plants' defenses, and would also be capable of diversifying, in the absence of competition by other herbivorous insects.  Thus, species associations can lead to rapid diversification of both lineages and contribute to overall community diversity.
89_9	CAR_d468310735178e2618696e99bc12b8d4b788400b	Each  species  in an  ecosystem  is affected by the other species in that ecosystem. There are very few single prey-single predator relationships. Most prey are consumed by more than one predator, and most predators have more than one prey. Their relationships are also influenced by other environmental factors.  In most cases, if one species is removed from an ecosystem, other species will most likely be affected, up to the point of extinction.
89_9	CAR_dbefd7a733e41f416f024ed533843fdee435ca76	The occurrence of common cuckoo in  Europe  is a good surrogate for  biodiversity  facets including taxonomic diversity and functional diversity in bird communities, and better than the traditional use of top predators as  bioindicator s. The reason for this is the strong correlation between the cuckoo's host species richness and overall bird species richness, due to co-evolutionary relationships. This may be useful for citizen science.
89_9	CAR_de4e1d60c370699eb07a9f7a437dd17649eb786e	When a  keystone species , such as a top predator, is removed from a community or ecosystem, a  cascade effect  can occur through which a series of secondary extinctions take place. Keystone predators are responsible for the control of prey densities, and their removal can result in an increase in one or a number of predators, consumers, or competitors elsewhere in the food web. Several prey or competitor species can consequently suffer a population decline and potentially be extirpated; the result of this would be a decrease in community diversity. Without the keystone species, prey populations can grow indefinitely and will, ultimately, be limited by resources such as food and shelter. Due to these secondary extinctions, a niche is left unfilled: this allows a new species to invade and exploit the resources that are no longer being used by other species.
89_9	CAR_dedf1b616dbd309051f9257bb5f11e0af751b749	The term "mesopredator release" was first used by Soulé and colleagues in 1988 to describe a process whereby mid-sized  carnivorous  mammals became far more abundant after being "released" from the control of a larger carnivore. This, in turn, resulted in decreased populations of still smaller  prey  species, such as birds. This may lead to dramatic prey population decline, or even extinction, especially on islands. This process arises when mammalian top predators are considered to be the most influential factor on  trophic  structure and  biodiversity  in terrestrial ecosystems.  Top predators may feed on herbivores and kill predators in lower  trophic level s as well.  Thus, reduction in the abundance of top predators may cause the medium-sized predator population to increase, therefore having a negative effect on the underlying prey community.  The mesopredator release hypothesis offers an explanation for the abnormally high numbers of mesopredators and the decline in prey abundance and diversity.  The hypothesis supports the argument for conservation of top predators because they protect smaller prey species that are in danger of extinction.  This argument has been a subject of interest within  conservation biology  for years, but few studies have adequately documented the phenomenon.
89_9	CAR_eb7d57d1c72769a621dfc260770a7f8bc9e5a851	Invasive predators can severely reduce the population sizes of native species, or even drive them extinct, because native prey species may not have evolved defenses against the novel predators.
89_9	CAR_f1facc3ad22913412a11508991d299ac2f3d7394	Predation  is hunting another species for food. This is a positive–negative (+ −) interaction in that the predator species benefits while the prey species is harmed. Some predators kill their prey before eating them (e.g., a hawk killing a mouse). Other predators are parasites that feed on prey while alive (e.g., a vampire bat feeding on a cow). Another example is the feeding on plants of  herbivore s (e.g., a cow grazing). Predation may affect the population size of predators and prey and the number of species coexisting in a community.
89_9	CAR_fadcdc3dc3e5f1fd0a6f8b270f6e4a22ac0fdaa9	Huffaker’s experimental universes showed that while under many circumstances predator–prey interactions will lead to extinction of both populations, interactions of spatial heterogeneity, dispersal ability of predator and prey species, and distribution of food sources can create an environment in which predator and prey species can coexist.  The distribution of one prey species placed on each of 120 oranges, the impediments to predator movement created by the petroleum jelly divisions between sections of oranges, and the dispersal aid of wooden sticks for the prey species, all worked together to create a spatially heterogeneous environment in which both the predator and prey species survived for three population cycles. Huffaker ultimately concluded that, with added spatial heterogeneity, these mite populations could have continued to oscillate beyond three cycles. Looking forward, Huffaker noted the importance of understanding these concepts with respect to understanding the impact of monocultures (i.e. low spatial heterogeneity) in industrial agriculture on biodiversity.
89_9	CAR_fe6ede4482f2696edd1d1e6fd85e30d11300b4e1	Since the tundra has such a harsh environment, the animals who live here have adapted in a way to call the tundra their home. The keystone species of the tundra can be as small as a lemming to as large as a musk ox. The low biodiversity means that fluctuation in individual animals can substantially affect the entire ecosystem. The main predators of the tundra are the polar bear, the Arctic wolf and the Arctic fox. They all have thick white coats that help them blend into their environment and stalk prey. The polar bear spends majority of its time out on the ice hunting seals and sometimes when small rodents are scarce on land the Arctic fox will follow the bears and eat their scraps. Wolves use teamwork to attack herds of caribou or musk ox for food. Lemming are small rodents that fluctuate every three to four years and with their fluctuations also comes the fluctuation of their predators such as the Arctic fox and the snowy owl. The keystone herbivores are the musk ox and the caribou. They have thick shaggy coats that they shed during the warmer months. Caribou use their nimble legs to escape quickly from predators while the musk ox use each other to make a fierce wall of horns. These animals help keep each other alive as well as the ecosystem around them.

When there are numerous plants, the number of herbivores increases in turn reduces the population of the plants.
89_9	MARCO_504654	Herbivory is the consumption of plant material by animals, and herbivores are animals adapted to eat plants. As in predator-prey interactions, this interaction drives adaptations in both the herbivore and the plant species it eats.redation provides energy to prolong the life and promote the reproduction of the organism that does the killing, the predator, to the detriment of the organism being consumed, the prey. Predation influences organisms at two ecological levels.
89_9	MARCO_6092048	Such predators are known as keystone species and may have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem. Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem.
89_9	MARCO_7579459	Well-known negative feedbacks include predator-prey interactions driving population cycles--as prey population growth goes up, the predator population eats well and their populations increase, but then there are many predators and prey goes down (so a + arrow followed by a - arrow).
89_9	MARCO_999115	Biotic factors within a community can affect the populations of organisms but are also essential to the balance of life within the ecosystem. Examples of Biotic Factors: 1. Competition for food is an example of a biotic factor in an ecosystem. A red squirrel and a grey squirrel living in the same habitat will compete for the same food source. 2. Predator-prey relationships are examples of biotic factors.
89_10	CAR_112a67e497ba985b97529a3ff8bed986e4f67508	This ant piper has hollow  petiole s which provide a home for ants, especially of the species  Pheidole bicornis . The plant also produces food bodies that the ants use as their main food source. The ants in turn defend the plant against predation by herbivorous caterpillars and  fungi . Adding to the complexity of this  food web  is the  beetle  Tarsobaenus letourneauae, a specialized predator which lives in the plant's petioles and feeds upon the ants and their eggs. This food web is an example of ecological top-down control, in which the top predator affects lower levels of the system. The beetle reduces the number of ants, which allows more herbivory to occur, causing foliage loss on the plant.
89_10	CAR_182a037319ce0bf6aa571be2420ab97190004916	The ecology of Homo sapiens has been noted as being that of an unprecedented "global superpredator" that regularly preys on the adults of other  apex predator s and has  worldwide effect s on  food web s. Extinctions of species have occurred on every  land mass  and  ocean , with many famous examples  within Africa ,  Asia ,  Europe ,  Australia ,  North  and  South America , and on smaller islands. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be characterized by the  human impact on the environment . The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century, with  overfishing ,  ocean acidification  and the  amphibian crisis  being a few broader examples of an almost universal,  cosmopolitan   decline in biodiversity .
89_10	CAR_1df0730f825c4bfd9642d4f7e7abfe0b62d2432a	Killer whales are  apex predator s, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they  hunt in groups like wolf packs . Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish,  cephalopod s, mammals,  sea bird s and  sea turtles . However, different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Those that feed on mammals may not even recognize fish as food. This specialization in diet and hunting is another reason to suggest that the orca is in fact several species, as discussed  above .
89_10	CAR_1ea7529aac13499cc1d5e2eac992cc2f18b46e56	The ecological effects of intraguild predation include direct effects on the survival and distribution of the competing predators, as well as indirect effects on the abundance and distribution of prey species and other species within the community.  Because they are so common, IGP interactions are important in structuring communities.  Intraguild predation may actually benefit the shared prey species by lowering overall predation pressure, particularly if the intermediate predator consumes more of the shared prey.  Intraguild predation can also dampen the effects of  trophic cascade s by providing redundancy in predation: if one predator is removed from the ecosystem, the other is still consuming the same prey species. Asymmetrical IGP can be a particularly strong influence on habitat selection.  Often, intermediate predators will avoid otherwise optimal habitat because of the presence of the top predator. Behavioral changes in intermediate predator distribution due to increased risk of predation can influence community structure more than direct mortality caused by the top predators.
89_10	CAR_23b5a145a343cd75753e2bbfa2f77766937ea8cb	Effects on wider ecosystem characteristics such as  plant ecology  have been debated, but there is evidence of a significant impact by apex predators. When introduced to  subarctic  islands, for example,  Arctic fox es' predation of  seabird s has been shown to turn  grassland  into  tundra . Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed  trophic cascade s. The removal of top-level predators, often – and, especially, recently – through human agency, can radically cause or disrupt trophic cascades.
89_10	CAR_2a1c0d3d13052acf8c6a9ef26b4006b7c4b25337	An ecological cascade effect is a series of secondary  extinction s that is triggered by the primary extinction of a key  species  in an  ecosystem .  Secondary extinctions are likely to occur when the threatened species are: dependent on a few specific food sources,  mutualistic  (dependent on the key species in some way), or forced to coexist with an  invasive species  that is introduced to the ecosystem. Species introductions to a foreign ecosystem can often devastate entire communities, and even entire ecosystems. These exotic species monopolize the ecosystem’s resources, and since they have no natural predators to decrease their growth, they are able to increase indefinitely. Olsen et al. showed that exotic species have caused lake and  estuary  ecosystems to go through cascade effects due to loss of  alga e,  crayfish ,  mollusk s, fish,  amphibian s, and birds.  However, the principal cause of cascade effects is the loss of top  predator s as the key species. As a result of this loss, a dramatic increase ( ecological release ) of  prey  species occurs. The prey is then able to  overexploit  its own food resources, until the population numbers decrease in abundance, which can lead  to extinction. When the prey’s food resources disappear, they starve and may go extinct as well. If the prey species is  herbivorous , then their initial release and exploitation of the plants may result in a loss of plant  biodiversity  in the area. If other  organism s in the ecosystem also depend upon these plants as food resources, then these species may go extinct as well. An example of the cascade effect caused by the loss of a top predator is apparent in  tropical forests . When hunters cause local extinctions of top predators, the predators’ prey's population numbers increase, causing an overexploitation of a food resource and a cascade effect of species loss. Recent studies have been performed on approaches to mitigate extinction cascades in food-web networks.

Apex predators do not need to be  hypercarnivore s.
89_10	CAR_3cc8d535557867117a26476b8ea6d63f14a31691	The major drawback to these methods is that the large amount of blood spilled could be smelled by other nearby carnivores, such as other machairodonts or dire wolves. Predators often form competitive relationships in which dominance can shift from one species to the other, as seen in the modern lion and spotted hyena of Africa. In such situations, squabbles are not uncommon. The balance of power and dominance between these apex predators remains a mystery because of the social factor. Strength in numbers can be significant in these struggles. For example, dire wolves are thought to have traveled in small packs, and while individually subordinate, their numbers might have been sufficient to force a machairodont off a kill.

89_10	CAR_4981d579e68f2a263dfb9db7916cda640f7570f3	Atlantic cod are apex predators and adults are generally free from the concerns of  predation . Juvenile cod, however, may serve as prey for adult cod, which sometimes practice  cannibalism . Juvenile cod make substrate decisions based on risk of predation. Substrates refer to different feeding and swimming environments. Without apparent risk of predation, juvenile cod demonstrated a preference for finer-grained substrates such as sand and gravel-pebble. However, in the presence of a predator, they preferred to seek safety in the space available between stones of a cobble substrate. Selection of cobble significantly reduces the risk of predation. Without access to cobble, the juvenile cod simply tries to escape a predator by fleeing.
89_10	CAR_5239c787229b83f95c8668e5b282e1ee5e587078	An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or apical predator, is a  predator  residing at the top of a  food chain  upon which no other creatures prey. Apex predators are usually defined in terms of  trophic dynamics , meaning that apex-predator species occupy the highest  trophic level or levels  and  play a crucial role in maintaining the health of their ecosystem s. One study of marine  food web s defined apex predators as greater than trophic level four. The apex predator concept is commonly applied in  wildlife management ,  conservation  and  ecotourism .
89_10	CAR_5c7e3a2b2ddd0435fb7f5a6c7d29142cfc07b43d	Sauroposeidon lived on the shores of the  Gulf of Mexico , which ran through Oklahoma at that time, in a vast  river delta  similar to the  Mississippi delta  today.  This paleoenvironment, which has been preserved in the  Antlers Formation , also stretches from southwest Arkansas through southeastern Oklahoma and into northeastern Texas.  This geological formation has not been dated radiometrically. Scientists have used biostratigraphic data and the fact that it shares several of the same genera as the Trinity Group of Texas, to surmise that this formation was laid down during the  Albian  stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, approximately 110 mya.  The area preserved in this formation was a large  floodplain  that drained into a shallow inland sea.  Several million years later, this sea would expand to the north, becoming the  Western Interior Seaway  and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire  Late Cretaceous  period.  The paleoenvironment of Sauroposeidon consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests,  river delta s, coastal swamps, bayous and lagoons, probably similar to that of modern-day  Louisiana . There were few predators which could attempt to attack a full-grown Sauroposeidon, but juveniles were likely to be preyed on by the contemporary  Acrocanthosaurus atokensis    (a  carnosaur  slightly smaller than a  Tyrannosaurus ), which likely were the  apex predators  in this region, and the small coelurosaur  Deinonychus antirrhopus .  Sauroposeidon  also shared its  paleoenvironment  with other dinosaurs, such as the  sauropod   Astrodon  (Pleurocoelus) and the most common dinosaur in this region, the  ornithopod   Tenontosaurus .  Other vertebrates present during this time included the  amphibian   Albanerpeton  arthridion, the reptiles Atokasaurus metarsiodon and Ptilotodon wilsoni, the  crurotarsan  reptile  Bernissartia , the  cartilaginous  fish  Hybodus  buderi and   Lissodus  anitae, the  ray-finned  fish  Gyronchus  dumblei, the crocodilians  Goniopholis  and  Paluxysuchus , and the turtles  Glyptops  and Naomichelys. Possible indeterminate bird remains are also known from the Antlers Formation.  The fossil evidence suggests that the  gar   Lepisosteus  was the most common vertebrate in this region.  The early mammals known from this region included Atokatherium boreni and  Paracimexomys  crossi.
89_10	CAR_5d6e978ece6991b4bca99176f7696001a884b707	Large mammalian carnivores are often absent on islands because of insufficient range or difficulties in  over-water dispersal . In their absence, the  ecological niche s for large predators may be occupied by birds, reptiles or smaller carnivorans, which can then grow to larger-than-normal size. For example, on prehistoric  Gargano Island  in the  Miocene - Pliocene   Mediterranean , on islands in the  Caribbean  like  Cuba , and on  Madagascar  and  New Zealand , some or all  apex predator s were birds like  eagle s,  falcon s and  owl s, including some of the largest known examples of these groups. However, birds and reptiles generally make less efficient large predators than advanced  carnivora ns.
89_10	CAR_5dd68880f6c53a8e127a7d534aedd6dfc7f41f37	The trophic level of an  organism  is the position it occupies in a  food chain . The word trophic derives from the  Greek   τροφή  (trophē) referring to food or feeding. A food chain represents a succession of organisms that eat another organism and are, in turn, eaten themselves. The number of steps an organism is from the start of the chain is a measure of its trophic level. Food chains start at trophic level 1 with  primary producer s such as plants, move to  herbivore s at level 2,  predator s at level 3 and typically finish with  carnivore s or  apex predator s at level 4 or 5. The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow or a food "web". Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths.
89_10	CAR_60d28de2b3eb1d1b6eebead936a373a6d45d1029	Terrestrial biomass generally decreases markedly at each higher  trophic level  (plants, herbivores, carnivores). Examples of terrestrial  producers  are grasses, trees and shrubs. These have a much higher biomass than the animals that  consume them , such as deer, zebras and insects. The level with the least biomass are the highest  predator s in the  food chain , such as foxes and eagles.
89_10	CAR_6393eddf9f13487b9653299ccd4fb6490461efe9	Classic studies in kelp forest ecology have largely focused on trophic interactions (the relationships between organisms and their  food webs ), particularly the understanding and top-down trophic processes. Bottom-up processes are generally driven by the abiotic conditions required for primary producers to grow, such as availability of light and nutrients, and the subsequent transfer of energy to consumers at higher trophic levels. For example, the occurrence of kelp is frequently correlated with oceanographic upwelling zones, which provide unusually high concentrations of nutrients to the local environment. This allows kelp to grow and subsequently support herbivores, which in turn support consumers at higher  trophic level s. By contrast, in top-down processes, predators limit the biomass of species at lower trophic levels through consumption. In the absence of predation, these lower-level species flourish because resources that support their energetic requirements are not limiting. In a well-studied example from Alaskan kelp forests,  sea otters  (Enhydra lutris) control populations of herbivorous  sea urchins  through predation. When sea otters are removed from the ecosystem (for example, by human exploitation), urchin populations are released from predatory control and grow dramatically. This leads to increased herbivore pressure on local kelp stands. Deterioration of the kelp itself results in the loss of physical ecosystem structure and subsequently, the loss of other species associated with this habitat. In Alaskan kelp forest ecosystems, sea otters are the  keystone species  that mediates this  trophic cascade . In Southern California, kelp forests persist without sea otters and the control of herbivorous urchins is instead mediated by a suite of predators including lobsters and large fishes, such as the  California sheephead . The effect of removing one predatory species in this system differs from Alaska because redundancy exists in the trophic levels and other predatory species can continue to regulate urchins. However, the removal of multiple predators can effectively release urchins from predator pressure and allow the system to follow trajectories towards kelp forest degradation. Similar examples exist in  Nova Scotia , South Africa, Australia and Chile. The relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up control in kelp forest ecosystems and the strengths of trophic interactions continue to be the subject of considerable scientific investigation.
89_10	CAR_663bd4fedb6046220de8037c8a247f413fef71c9	The adult jaguar is an  apex predator , meaning it exists at the top of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a  keystone species , as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as  herbivorous  and  granivorous  mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the  keystone predator  hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.
89_10	CAR_667a84a8068752e8757677dcb456ad7191741299	In the prehistoric eras, the Tyrannosaurus rex may have been an  apex predator , preying upon  hadrosaur s,  ceratopsia ns, and possibly juvenile sauropods, although some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The debate about whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or scavenger was among the longest ongoing feud in  paleontology ; however, most scientists now agree that Tyrannosaurus rex was an opportunistic carnivore, acting mostly as a predator but scavenging when it could.  Recent research also shows that while an adult Tyrannosaurus rex would energetically gain little though scavenging, smaller theropods of approximately 500 kg may have potentially gained levels similar to that of hyenas, though not enough for them to rely on scavenging.
89_10	CAR_687e2f172136457f76c7446807568880b361fb90	Apex predators affect prey species' population dynamics. Where two competing species are in an ecologically unstable relationship, apex predators tend to create stability if they prey upon both. Inter-predator relationships are also affected by apex status. Non-native fish, for example, have been known to devastate formerly dominant predators. One lake manipulation study found that when the non-native  smallmouth bass  was removed,  lake trout , the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its  trophic level .
89_10	CAR_6920120f941f675ce5972748d8224f8117d99e37	An apex predator affects prey population dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly  Arctic fox es (Vulpes lagopus) and  glaucous gull s (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The  evolutionary pressure  of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and  Antarctic  seals. Compared to the Antarctic, where there is no major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide  camouflage  from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.

It is capable of prevailing over almost any animal that enters its territory, including other  apex predators  such as  shark s, varieties of  freshwater  and  marine fish  including  pelagic  species,  invertebrate s, such as  crustacean s, various  reptile s,  bird s and  mammal s, including  humans . Due to their size, aggression and distribution, saltwater crocodiles are regarded as the most dangerous  extant   crocodilia n to humans.

89_10	CAR_7630b20f380a368ef32356542b0e89a8a979de82	The  opossum shrimp , Mysis diluviana, were introduced by Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in the Flathead drainage basin to encourage production of larger kokanee salmon and wound up in Flathead Lake. Lake trout had been introduced 80 years prior but remained at low densities until nonnative Mysis became established. The bottom-dwelling mysids eliminated a recruitment bottleneck for lake trout by providing a deep water source of food where little was available previously. Lake trout subsequently flourished on mysids and this voracious piscivore now dominates the lake fishery; formerly abundant  kokanee  were extirpated, and native bull and westslope cutthroat trout are imperiled. Predation by Mysis shifted  zooplankton  and  phytoplankton  community size structure. Bayesian change point analysis of primary productivity (27-y time series) showed a significant step increase of 55 mg C m−2 d−1 (i.e., 21% rise) concurrent with the mysid invasion, but little trend before or after despite increasing nutrient loading. Mysis facilitated predation by lake trout and indirectly caused the collapse of kokanee, redirecting energy flow through the ecosystem that would otherwise have been available to other top predators (bald eagles).
89_10	CAR_7e88d96a5e2b552c7c6f2c46eead3bb8d9b64241	Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though  blue jay s prey on  insect s, they may in turn be prey for  cat s and  snake s, and snakes may be the prey of  hawk s. One way of classifying predators is by  trophic level . Organisms that feed on  autotroph s, the producers of the  trophic pyramid , are known as  herbivore s or primary consumers; those that feed on  heterotroph s such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of  carnivore , but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a  lion  that preys upon large herbivores such as  wildebeest , which in turn eat  grass es). A predator at the top of any  food chain  (that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism) is called an  apex predator ; examples include the  orca ,  sperm whale ,  anaconda ,  Komodo dragon ,  tiger ,  lion ,  tiger shark ,  Nile crocodile , and most  eagle s and  owl s—and even omnivorous humans and  grizzly bear s. An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a  dog  among  alligator s, a  skunk  in the presence of the  great horned owl  immune to skunk spray,  or a  snapping turtle  among  jaguar s; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a  domestic cat  or a  dog  in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default.

Fish have large impacts in pelagic habitats that can alter the food chain and even eliminate certain species. Diaptomid kenai is considered a large species that is less commonly found in shallow lakes with trout reproduction. They are often red in color and are easy targets for predatory trout. Lakes with an absence of D. kenai allow smaller copepod species such as D. tymelli to exist in higher numbers. This correlation suggests predation of large copepods on smaller copepod species. In lakes that are deeper and have limited trout reproduction cohabitation has been observed with an overall reduced body size for D.kenai. The presence of Gammarus, a predatory amphipod, also dictates levels within the food chain. [Weidman 2011]. Non-native trout, salamander larvae, or Gammarus will step into the role of top pelagic predator when others above it are absent.  Similarly D. kenai will become top predator with the absence of a larger predator in the water column. These dynamic interactions also depend on a variety of abiotic factor, which provide suitable habitat conditions for both the copepod and Gammarus species.

Full scavengers (e.g. most  vulture s), although they may not be preyed on either, are not counted as apex predators unless they at least partially depend on capturing live prey.

They are  generalists , taking a variety of prey. Their diet consists mostly of different species of  fish ,  reptile s,  bird s and  mammal s. The Nile crocodile is an  ambush predator  that can wait for hours, days and even weeks for the suitable moment to attack. They are quite agile  predator s and wait for the opportunity for a prey item to come well within attack range. Even swift prey are not immune to attack. Like other crocodiles, Nile crocodiles have an extremely powerful  bite  that is unique amongst all animals and sharp conical  teeth  that sink into flesh allowing for a grip that is almost impossible to loosen. They can apply high levels of force for extended periods of time, a great advantage for holding down large  prey  underwater to drown.

For example, some studies show that up to 43% of the diet of some lynx may consist of black musk deer. Humans prey on the deer more than all of their natural predators combined. They are caught and killed mainly for their musk glands, which are used as a base for perfumes. Ethical concerns have led to the use of synthetic musk, but this has not prevented the black musk deer from being included on the endangered list.
89_10	CAR_b57a13e323b79ccb593a1e10cac28e711993ce55	The giant trevally is an   apex predator  in most of its habitats, and is known to hunt individually and in schools. The species predominantly takes various fish as  prey , although  crustacean s,  cephalopod s and  mollusc s make up a considerable part of their diets in some regions. The species has some quite novel hunting strategies, including shadowing  monk seal s to pick off escaping prey, as well as using  shark s to ambush prey. The species reproduces in the warmer months, with peaks differing by region.  Spawning  occurs at specific stages of the  lunar cycle , when large schools congregate to spawn over reefs and bays, with reproductive behaviour observed in the wild. The fish grows relatively fast, reaching  sexual maturity  at a length of around 60 cm at three years of age. The giant trevally is both an important species to commercial  fisheries  and a recognised  gamefish , with the species taken by nets and lines by professionals and by bait and lures by anglers. Catch statistics in the  Asia n region show hauls of 4000-10 000  tonnes , while around 10 000  lbs  of the species is taken in Hawaii each year. The species is considered poor to excellent  table fare  by different authors, although  ciguatera  poisoning is common in the fish. Dwindling numbers around the main Hawaiian Islands have also led to several proposals to reduce the catch of fish in this region.

89_10	CAR_be3e42fc46cd01d54a236a281c482a132d91e96f	Glyptodonts possessed a  tortoise -like body armour, made of bony deposits in their skin called  osteoderm s or  scute s. Each species of glyptodont had a unique osteoderm pattern and shell type. With this protection, they were armored like  turtle s; glyptodonts could not withdraw their heads, but their armoured skin provided a bony cap on the top of their skull. Even glyptodont tails had a ring of bones for protection.  Doedicurus  possessed a large mace-like spiked tail that it would have used to defend itself from predators and, possibly, other Doedicurus. Glyptodonts also had size on their side; many, such as the  type genus ,  Glyptodon , were the size of modern  automobiles . The presence of such heavy defenses suggests the presence of a large, effective predator. At the time that glyptodonts evolved, the apex predators in the island continent of South America were  phorusrhacids , a family of giant flightless carnivorous birds.

89_10	CAR_d4c7648882995c909cb602b20a7bac1f85f074e1	A now commonly cited example of the effect of apex predators on an ecosystem is the dramatic changes in the  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem  recorded after the  gray wolf  was reintroduced to  Yellowstone National Park  in 1995.  Elk , the wolves' primary prey, became less abundant and changed their behavior, freeing  riparian zone s from constant grazing and allowing  willow s,  aspen s and  cottonwoods  to flourish, creating  habitat s for  beaver ,  moose  and scores of other species. In addition to their effect on prey species, the wolves' presence also affected one of the park's  vulnerable species , the  grizzly bear : emerging from  hibernation , having fasted for months, the bears chose to  scavenge  wolf kills, especially during the autumn as they prepared to hibernate once again. The grizzly bear gives birth during hibernation, so the increased food supply is expected to produce an increase in the numbers of cubs observed.  Dozens of other species, including eagles, ravens, magpies, coyotes and  black bear s have also been documented as scavenging from wolf kills within the park.
89_10	CAR_d791ac895b702fb67dae2ead5b0ec7e07e9b9975	The hypothesis is sometimes also applied to humans as apex predators that produce top-down effects on lower trophic levels.  However, it fails to recognize bottom-up effects that anthropogenic land transformations can have on landscapes on which primary producers, prey species, and mesopredators dwell.  Possible bottom-up effects on an ecosystem can be from  bioclimatic  impacts on ecosystem productivity and from anthropogenic habitat alterations.  Examples of anthropogenic habitat change include agriculture, grazing land, and urbanization.  More importantly, the hypothesis does not take into account that higher trophic levels are affected by  primary productivity .  It also does not mention that trophic interactions operate at different strengths according to the ecosystem.  Therefore, the roles of predation and food/nutrient processes in influencing ecosystem structures remain open to controversy and further testing.
89_10	CAR_dedf1b616dbd309051f9257bb5f11e0af751b749	The term "mesopredator release" was first used by Soulé and colleagues in 1988 to describe a process whereby mid-sized  carnivorous  mammals became far more abundant after being "released" from the control of a larger carnivore. This, in turn, resulted in decreased populations of still smaller  prey  species, such as birds. This may lead to dramatic prey population decline, or even extinction, especially on islands. This process arises when mammalian top predators are considered to be the most influential factor on  trophic  structure and  biodiversity  in terrestrial ecosystems.  Top predators may feed on herbivores and kill predators in lower  trophic level s as well.  Thus, reduction in the abundance of top predators may cause the medium-sized predator population to increase, therefore having a negative effect on the underlying prey community.  The mesopredator release hypothesis offers an explanation for the abnormally high numbers of mesopredators and the decline in prey abundance and diversity.  The hypothesis supports the argument for conservation of top predators because they protect smaller prey species that are in danger of extinction.  This argument has been a subject of interest within  conservation biology  for years, but few studies have adequately documented the phenomenon.
89_10	CAR_dff2594b591f7fee6b029e077c184baaec75f4d1	The park is a commonly cited example of  apex predator s affecting an ecosystem through a  trophic cascade . After the reintroduction of the  gray wolf  in 1995, researchers noticed drastic changes occurring.  Elk , the primary prey of the gray wolf, became less abundant and changed their behavior, freeing riparian zones from constant grazing. The respite allowed willows and aspens to grow, creating habitat for  beaver ,  moose , and scores of other species. In addition to the effects on prey species, the gray wolf's presence also affected the park's  grizzly bear  population. The bears, emerging from hibernation, chose to scavenge off wolf kills to gain needed energy and fatten up after fasting for months. Dozens of other species have been documented scavenging from wolf kills.

Plants turn that sunlight into usable food energy, and that energy is transfered to the herbivorous animals that eat those plants. When those plant eating animals are themselves eaten by predators, the energy is transfered higher up the food chain and becomes concentrated in the bodies of the top, or apex, predators. The apex predators return energy to the food web after they die and their bodies are consumed by scavengers, fungi and microbes.

Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite  taboo s that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native  euplerids , such as the  fossa ,  feral cat s,  domestic dogs ,  snake s, diurnal  birds of prey ,  owl s, and  crocodile s. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus  Aquila  and the giant  Malagasy crowned eagle  (Stephanoaetus mahery), as well as the giant fossa ( Cryptoprocta spelea ), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100 g (3.5 oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the  Madagascan harrier-hawk  (Polyboroides radiatus) and the  Madagascar buzzard  (Buteo brachypterus).

The book argues that  factory farming  inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for  their flesh  is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected.  Milk  and  egg  production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist were it not for the human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by  nonhuman predators . He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not  moral agents  and the  consequentialist  claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the  harvesting process . These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.

Anecdotally, both bears and wolves have been reported to prey on takin when they can, which is likely given the opportunistic nature of those predators. However, the only confirmed natural predator of takin is the  snow leopard , although mature adults may be exempted from regular predation (due to their size) from that predator. The main predator of takin are humans, who hunt them usually for meat (considered delicious by local people), though secondarily for their pelts. Humans have long since exploited takin's fondness for salt licks, where they are easily cornered and killed. Takin are likely still occasionally killed.

He has coauthored papers with other scientists in the field of trophic cascades and apex predators, including an exhaustive review of the status and ecological impacts of the worlds 31 largest mammalian carnivores. He led an international team of scientists reviewing the status and ecological effects of the world's largest herbivores. Ripple has also applied trophic cascade theory to the subject of the  Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions . The hypothesis being that North American Pleistocene megafauna existed at low population densities, primarily limited by the apex predators of the time. The arrival of a novel and essentially  invasive  top predator (humans) could have driven these predator-limited populations to extinction.
89_11	CAR_7e88d96a5e2b552c7c6f2c46eead3bb8d9b64241	Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though  blue jay s prey on  insect s, they may in turn be prey for  cat s and  snake s, and snakes may be the prey of  hawk s. One way of classifying predators is by  trophic level . Organisms that feed on  autotroph s, the producers of the  trophic pyramid , are known as  herbivore s or primary consumers; those that feed on  heterotroph s such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of  carnivore , but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a  lion  that preys upon large herbivores such as  wildebeest , which in turn eat  grass es). A predator at the top of any  food chain  (that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism) is called an  apex predator ; examples include the  orca ,  sperm whale ,  anaconda ,  Komodo dragon ,  tiger ,  lion ,  tiger shark ,  Nile crocodile , and most  eagle s and  owl s—and even omnivorous humans and  grizzly bear s. An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a  dog  among  alligator s, a  skunk  in the presence of the  great horned owl  immune to skunk spray,  or a  snapping turtle  among  jaguar s; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a  domestic cat  or a  dog  in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default.

89_11	CAR_b9348b335f0be75c2505ff62dc1d3bac73ae86cd	Humans are to some extent predatory,  fishing ,  hunting  and  trapping animals  using weapons and tools. They also use other predatory species, such as dogs,  cormorant s, and  falcon s to catch prey for food or for sport.
89_11	CAR_c34c2ee7e7948ba6aaa8a3458dc745b96ed98955	Fishing has had a devastating effect on marine organism populations for several centuries even before the explosion of destructive and highly effective fishing practices like  trawling . Humans are unique among predators in that they regularly predate on other adult  apex predator s, particularly in marine environments;  bluefin tuna ,  blue whales , and various  shark s in particular are particularly vulnerable to predation pressure from human fishing. A 2016 study published in  Science  concludes that humans tend to hunt larger species, and this could disrupt ocean ecosystems for millions of years. Jonathan Payne, associate professor and chair of geological sciences at Stanford University, explains: "If this pattern goes unchecked, the future oceans would lack many of the largest species in today’s oceans. Many large species play critical roles in ecosystems and so their extinctions could lead to ecological cascades that would influence the structure and function of future ecosystems beyond the simple fact of losing those species."
89_11	CAR_d791ac895b702fb67dae2ead5b0ec7e07e9b9975	The hypothesis is sometimes also applied to humans as apex predators that produce top-down effects on lower trophic levels.  However, it fails to recognize bottom-up effects that anthropogenic land transformations can have on landscapes on which primary producers, prey species, and mesopredators dwell.  Possible bottom-up effects on an ecosystem can be from  bioclimatic  impacts on ecosystem productivity and from anthropogenic habitat alterations.  Examples of anthropogenic habitat change include agriculture, grazing land, and urbanization.  More importantly, the hypothesis does not take into account that higher trophic levels are affected by  primary productivity .  It also does not mention that trophic interactions operate at different strengths according to the ecosystem.  Therefore, the roles of predation and food/nutrient processes in influencing ecosystem structures remain open to controversy and further testing.
89_11	CAR_de8d1043f31a9d2c4dd88bb60969a853874f3f9c	Humans range from complete vegetarians to nearly-complete carnivores, so the status of humans even as predators is often suspect even if  armed  humans are extremely dangerous to any animal. When hunting with firearms, dogs, falcons, or such tools as spears, snares, clubs, or fishing gear, humans are at least local superpredators along with their dogs.
89_11	CAR_e032451d2211733d3f6fdbf67fe0e0aa016c81ce	The question of whether or not  homo sapiens  qualifies as an apex predator is a complex one that has been subject to various analyses for years. The highly varied environments that human beings have lived in (and continue to live in) coupled with the similarly highly varied behaviors of  human cultures  towards animals make generalizations particularly difficult; though as  omnivores  that far and away consume more plant matter than meat, humans have the organized ability to drive other species into  extinction  as well as  threatened status  vastly unlike any other animal. The topic has been explored in publications such as the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  and  Scientific American , with disputed results.
89_11	CAR_e59df9d22a5f8556a2989cf15c1f34c4d50a8141	Among predators there is a large degree of specialization. Many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey. Others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything (examples:  human s,  leopard s,  dog s and  alligator s). The specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey. The prey in turn, are often equally suited to escape that predator. This is called an  evolutionary arms race  and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium. Some predators specialize in certain classes of prey, not just single species. Some will switch to other prey (with varying degrees of success) when the preferred target is extremely scarce, and they may also resort to  scavenging  or a herbivorous diet if possible.

Only humans pose a threat to an adult but juveniles are consumed by other muskies, northern pike,  bass ,  trout , and occasionally birds of prey. The musky's low reproductive rate and slow growth render populations highly vulnerable to  overfishing . This has prompted some jurisdictions to institute  artificial propagation  programs in an attempt to maintain otherwise unsustainably high rates of angling effort and  habitat destruction .
89_11	CAR_ec168ecd8eb39fbe15cded6bdf9ef635bb451182	With the many possible advantages outlined above, it still remains unclear as to why vocal learning is so rare. One proposed explanation is that predatory pressure applies a strong selective force against vocal learning. If mates prefer more variable vocalizations, predators may also be more strongly attracted to more variable vocalizations. As innate calls are typically constant, predators quickly habituate to these vocalizations and ignore them as background noise. In contrast, the variable vocalizations of vocal learners are less likely to be ignored, possibly increasing the  predation  rate among vocal learners. In this case, relaxed predation pressure or some mechanism to overcome increased predation must first develop to facilitate the evolution of vocal learning. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that many mammalian vocal learners including  human s,  whale s, and  elephant s have very few major predators. Similarly, several avian vocal learners have behaviors that are effective in avoiding predators, from the rapid flight and escape behavior of  hummingbirds  to predator mobbing in  parrots  and  songbirds .

Humans are largely considered to be the primary predator of whales. Because of the large size and thick skin of many species of whales, it makes it difficult for natural predators, such as killer whales and sharks, to kill and eat full-grown whales. The few natural predators of the whale often choose to hunt baby whales or smaller species of whales, because they are easier to kill.

Boeing claims the 747-8I to be over 10% lighter per seat and have 11% less fuel consumption per passenger, with a trip-cost reduction of 21% and a seat-mile cost reduction of more than 6%, compared to the A380. The 747-8F's empty weight is expected to be 80 tonnes (88 tons) lighter and 24% lower fuel burnt per ton with 21% lower trip costs and 23% lower ton-mile costs than the A380F. On the other hand, Airbus claims the A380 to have 8% less fuel consumption per passenger than the 747-8I and in 2007 Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per passenger than the airline's  747-400  fleet. Emirates'  Tim Clark  also claims that the A380 is more fuel economic at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83. One independent, industry analysis shows fuel consumption in litres per seat per 100 kilometres flown (L/seat/100 km) as 3.27 for the A380 and 3.35 for the B747-8I, or a fuel cost per seat mile of $0.055 and $0.057 respectively. A possible, as yet uncommitted, re-engined A380neo is expected to achieve  2.82 or 2.65 L/seat/100 km depending on the options taken.

The MTOW increase is 5 t from the previously certified 275 t variant. As the A350-900 fuel consumption is 5.8 t/hr, it needs an additional 24 tonnes of fuel to fly 19 hours instead of the standard 15 hours, gained through MTOW increase and lower payload allowing larger fuel capacity.

Note that on average 20% of seats are left unoccupied. Jet aircraft efficiencies are improving: Between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55% overall  fuel efficiency  gain (if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the DH Comet 4 and to consider the Boeing 707 as the base case). Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s, current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile. Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4%.  Concorde  the  supersonic transport  managed about 17 passenger-miles to the Imperial gallon; similar to a business jet, but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft.  Airbus  puts the fuel rate consumption of their  A380  at less than 3 l/100 km per passenger (78 passenger-miles per US gallon).

90_5	CAR_31188d477f7ffb259b1a6fa2d6289645d5c9f01f	Airbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months. This reduced the total number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90–100. On 13 June 2006, Airbus announced a second delay, with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months. Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006, deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft, and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70–80 aircraft. The announcement caused a 26% drop in the share price of Airbus' parent, EADS, and led to the departure of EADS CEO  Noël Forgeard , Airbus CEO  Gustav Humbert , and A380 programme manager  Charles Champion . On 3 October 2006, upon completion of a review of the A380 program, Airbus CEO  Christian Streiff  announced a third delay, pushing the first delivery to October 2007, to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008, 25 in 2009, and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010. The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to €4.8 billion.

The smaller A330-200 competes with the  767 , outselling its Boeing counterpart in recent years. The A380 is anticipated to further reduce sales of the Boeing 747, gaining Airbus a share of the market in very large aircraft, though frequent delays in the A380 programme have caused several customers to consider the refreshed  747–8 . Airbus has also proposed the  A350 XWB  to compete with the   Boeing 787 Dreamliner , after being under great pressure from airlines to produce a competing model.
90_5	CAR_493f5f105d820975452643f4ac701f6ee7ce6d19	In May 2015 Transaero announced the expected receipt of their first two  Airbus A380-800 s and one  Boeing 747-8  later in the year. The A380s were intended to operate from Moscow to New York and Vladivostok. However, this was quickly followed by a report that Transaero asked Airbus to reschedule the delivery of the first A380 beyond 2015 due to financial difficulties. At the IATA Annual General Meeting and World Air Transport Summit in June 2015, the president of Airbus, Fabrice Brégier said “I’m sure we will meet the target to deliver the A380s to Transaero. The problem is that they are facing a difficult economic situation because of the rouble’s devaluation and a shrinking market for tourism from Russia.”
90_5	CAR_4d7fb9aaa560ac6d56c49b8e76d682b4f077b7ad	Emirates  has also planned to use the  A380  to  Jakarta , however the airport as of 2016 is still not ready for the A380. Emirates has refused to yield to the fact that Airbus is delaying the delivery of the A380 and made a statement that they are receiving the A380's at a more rapid rate than the other operators. On 28 May 2010, the airline received their 9th A380. As of 1 September 2016,  Emirates  is the largest operator of the  A380 , with 84 of this type in its fleet. Furthermore, the airline has 58 more  A380 s on order, which, when delivered, would increase the number of  A380 s in service to 142. They could buy an additional 100 to 200  Airbus A380 s if the four-engined superjumbo were revamped with more fuel-efficient engines by 2020. The airline plans to retire their  A380 s after 12 years of service.

Bradley Airport is one of only 68 airports worldwide large enough to accommodate the A380. No carriers provide regular A380 service to Bradley, but the airport occasionally is a diversion airfield for JFK-bound A380s.
90_5	CAR_6497306a48ec3696f43b8f57d5441356b99aab12	As of December 2015, Airbus has 319  orders  for the passenger version of the A380 and is not currently offering the  A380-800 freighter . Production of the A380F has been suspended until the A380 production lines have settled with no firm availability date.  A number of original A380F orders were cancelled following  delays to the A380 program  in October 2006, notably  FedEx  and the  United Parcel Service .  Some A380 launch customers converted their A380F orders to the passenger version or switched to the 747-8F or  777F aircraft.
90_5	CAR_687dbe2b9fdc8a67aa3fdc1895f5a8c0fdac26d8	Demand has been chiefly for the 747-8F, which accounts for the majority of 747-8 aircraft ordered. The large capacity of the 747-8 is an advantage for the freighter version, not the passenger version.  Moreover, the freighter has no direct competitor. Airbus' competing A380 freighter version was canceled during development.
90_5	CAR_85079ce3a7942d00b836dfa57531494ed04595a1	The Boeing 747-8I was intended to fill a niche between the  Airbus A380  and the  Boeing 777 -300ER.  The future for the 747-8 passenger version appears limited. Airlines bought the original 747 primarily for its range, not its capacity. The advent of long-range twin-engine jets took away the 747's range advantage, notably Boeing's own  777 . Compared to the 747-8I, the upcoming  777-9X  "mini jumbo jet" is projected to have a lower fuel cost per seat mile and greater cargo capacity, though it has a lower passenger capacity and higher list price; consequently the 777-9X has tallied more orders than the 747-8I due to airlines placing a high value on fuel efficiency. For operators who require high capacity on routes such as  Emirates Airlines , most have preferred the Airbus A380 as it is an all-new design while the 747-8's lineage is 40 years old, although some have criticized the A380's looks saying "Seeing a 747-8I in the air is like watching Cinderella, while watching the A380 is like watching her ugly stepsister". Analysts do not see bright prospects for both VLA (very large aircraft; those with more than 400 seats) whose orders have slowed in the mid-2010s, since there are widebody twinjets with similar range while being more fuel efficient giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost. In 2015 Lufthansa was the only airline to operate both the 747-8I and A380.
90_5	CAR_bd4c0cf5eea1d53bde8d9ebd11021e8c2ce55f8d	On 29 September 2000, SIA announced an order for up to 25 Airbus A3XX (as the A380 was known at the time). The US$8.6 billion order comprised a firm order of 10 aircraft, with  options  on another 15 airframes. The order was confirmed by Singapore Airlines on 12 July 2001. In January 2005, the airline unveiled the slogan "First to Fly the A380 – Experience the Difference in 2006", to promote itself as the first airline to take delivery of the  A380-800 , which was expected to take place in the second quarter of 2006. In June 2005, Airbus confirmed that due to unforeseen technical problems, initial deliveries of the Airbus A380 would be delayed by up to six months, with the first delivery now slated for November 2006. The announcement was met with fury by SIA's chief executive officer,  Chew Choon Seng , who threatened to sue Airbus, saying: "Airbus took some time to acknowledge the delay in the timetable for the A380's entry into service...I would have expected more sincerity."
90_5	CAR_daf2b4cb4e1a5ced54456645b8ca3c55fa41509d	Airbus says that some A380s may not be delivered to customers or even built. This decision came when Airbus had not met the 'Accord and Satisfaction' for three already built aircraft for an undisclosed Japanese airline. "Without referring to any specific airline, I can assure you that we have cases where airlines are in the order backlog but not in the production plan," chief executive officer Tom Enders said in August 2014 during a conference call to discuss earnings with  Bloomberg . "We are watching the situation carefully, and know about the strengths and weaknesses of customers." Among customers that have ordered superjumbos yet remain undecided about actually taking them is  Virgin Atlantic , with six units on the order book.  Qantas  had also planned to top up its existing fleet by as many as eight airplanes, an expansion that has been thrown into doubt amid a cost-cutting drive. Amedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s, has yet to find a single client for the jet.
90_5	CAR_efa6166aa1db2a3e337e93404a85d91893f9dad7	The Airbus A380 was delayed in October 2006 due to the use of incompatible  software used to design  the aircraft. Primarily, the  Toulouse  assembly plant used the latest version 5 of  CATIA  (made by  Dassault ), while the design centre at the  Hamburg  factory were using the older and incompatible version 4. The result was that the 530 km of cables wiring throughout the aircraft had to be completely redesigned. Although no orders had been cancelled, Airbus still had to pay millions in late-delivery penalties.
90_5	CAR_efbfec6342c133b0b3995fb410172710f8bf7294	Initial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the  of wiring in each aircraft. Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring (98,000 wires and 40,000 connectors), its concurrent design and production, the high degree of customisation for each airline, and failures of  configuration management  and  change control . The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use  CATIA  version 4, while British and French sites migrated to version 5. This caused overall configuration management problems, at least in part because wire harnesses manufactured using  aluminium  rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non-standard dimensions and bend radii; these were not easily transferred between versions of the software.
90_5	CAR_ffd5cecd30344df1ce750f82ac9cdd753d60d9cf	On 11 December 2014, after slower than expected orders for the aircraft in 2014, Harald Wilhelm, the company's Chief Finance Officer, voiced the possibility to end the program in 2018. His statement was met by protests from customers and a fall in share prices. Airbus responded to the protests by playing down the possibility the A380 would be abandoned, instead emphasizing that enhancing the airplane was a likelier scenario.  On 22 December 2014,  CEO   Fabrice Brégier  ruled out the cancellation of the A380 program, stating that it will break even in 2015 but also that the A380 was introduced a decade too early. While no longer losing money on each plane sold, Airbus admits that the company will never recoup the $25 billion investment it made in the project.

The company also launched new variants of its successful 737 and 777 models. The 787 proved to be highly popular choice with airlines, and won a record number of pre-launch orders. With delays to Airbus'  A380  program several airlines threatened to switch their A380 orders to Boeing's new 747 version, the  747-8 . Airbus's response to the 787, the  A350 , received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the A330, and then gained significant orders when Airbus promised an entirely new design. The 787 program has encountered delays, with the first flight not occurring until late 2009.
90_6	CAR_3309e30e008cb19bdc5b6a3684e4e968fb17d334	In recent years the  Boeing 777  has outsold its Airbus counterparts, which include the A340 family as well as the A330-300. The smaller A330-200 competes with the  767 , outselling its Boeing counterpart in recent years. The A380 is anticipated to further reduce sales of the Boeing 747, gaining Airbus a share of the market in very large aircraft, though frequent delays in the A380 programme have caused several customers to consider the refreshed  747–8 . Airbus has also proposed the  A350 XWB  to compete with the   Boeing 787 Dreamliner , after being under great pressure from airlines to produce a competing model.
90_6	CAR_56129fc2d602c396942a244e5ba29cbfb4a873de	Boeing initially ruled out producing a re-engined version of its 737 to compete with the  Airbus A320neo family  launch planned for 2015, believing airlines would be looking towards the  Boeing Y1  and a 30% fuel saving, instead of paying 10% more for fuel efficiency gains of only a few percent. Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, there did prove to be considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, who use the 737 for their entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said they were not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatened to convert to Airbus. Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the  737 MAX  project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.
90_6	CAR_59f2a1b0064dc58c66dfb02e203b6146aad050d7	The order in question had long been pending, and both  Boeing  and  Airbus  had been competing heavily for the contract. Both offered shared production in Canada, and Boeing went so far as to buy  de Havilland Canada  to further strengthen their bargaining position, as well as gain access to the  feederliner  market where they, at that time, had no presence. The contract was eventually won by Airbus in 1988, with an order for 34  Airbus A320 s, as well as the sale of some of Air Canada's existing  Boeing 747  fleet. Boeing immediately put de Havilland up for sale, thereby putting that company in jeopardy, but the blame for this was generally placed on the government.
90_6	CAR_768f31b9c6c63920a4ccdd4067955feb017775a1	In the 1960s,  American Airlines  approached Lockheed and competitor Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas) with the need for an airliner smaller than the 747 capable of carrying a large passenger load to distant locales such as London and  Latin America  from company hubs at  Dallas-Ft Worth  and New York. Lockheed had not produced civilian airliners since 1961 with the  L-188 Electra . In the 1950s the Electra was designed for turboprop propulsion, which Lockheed had successfully used on the  C-130 Hercules  military transport. Even after the Electra overcame vibration problems that caused a number of crashes early in its career, the market for large airliners would soon shift over to jet airliners like the  Boeing 707  and  Douglas DC-8 . Lockheed won contracts for jet military transports with the  C-141 StarLifter , and pioneered very large jet transports with the large  C-5 Galaxy  with its high-bypass turbofan engines. Boeing lost the military contract, but its private venture 747 captured what would become a much larger civilian airliner market for  wide-body  airliners.  Having experienced difficulties with some of their military programs, Lockheed was eager to re-enter the civilian market with a smaller wide-body jet, and their response was the L-1011 TriStar. The aircraft was originally conceived as a "jumbo twin", but a three-engine design was ultimately chosen to give the aircraft enough thrust to take off from existing runways.
90_6	CAR_788926c7ef7d068002ea41ac8fbfee01eb6ad2e6	During the 1990s both companies researched the feasibility of a passenger aircraft larger than the  Boeing 747 , which was then the largest airliner in operation. Airbus subsequently launched a full-length  double-deck aircraft , the  A380 , a decade later while Boeing decided the project would not be commercially viable and developed the third generation 747,  Boeing 747-8 , instead.  The Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747-8 are therefore placed in direct competition on long-haul routes.
90_6	CAR_85079ce3a7942d00b836dfa57531494ed04595a1	The Boeing 747-8I was intended to fill a niche between the  Airbus A380  and the  Boeing 777 -300ER.  The future for the 747-8 passenger version appears limited. Airlines bought the original 747 primarily for its range, not its capacity. The advent of long-range twin-engine jets took away the 747's range advantage, notably Boeing's own  777 . Compared to the 747-8I, the upcoming  777-9X  "mini jumbo jet" is projected to have a lower fuel cost per seat mile and greater cargo capacity, though it has a lower passenger capacity and higher list price; consequently the 777-9X has tallied more orders than the 747-8I due to airlines placing a high value on fuel efficiency. For operators who require high capacity on routes such as  Emirates Airlines , most have preferred the Airbus A380 as it is an all-new design while the 747-8's lineage is 40 years old, although some have criticized the A380's looks saying "Seeing a 747-8I in the air is like watching Cinderella, while watching the A380 is like watching her ugly stepsister". Analysts do not see bright prospects for both VLA (very large aircraft; those with more than 400 seats) whose orders have slowed in the mid-2010s, since there are widebody twinjets with similar range while being more fuel efficient giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost. In 2015 Lufthansa was the only airline to operate both the 747-8I and A380.
90_6	CAR_85a14cd392b7b6562878e445671b4622ebddf104	The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively  fuel-efficient  alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the  Airbus A330-300 , newly launched  Airbus A350 XWB , and the out-of-production  A340  and  McDonnell Douglas MD-11 . The  787 Dreamliner , which entered service in 2011, shares design features with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8 and 777-9 variants, collectively named  777X , featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787. The new 777X series is planned to enter service by 2020.
90_6	CAR_90a2476d015879170cbf5149bc8a6e77dc5898c7	The 747-8, as the current new development of Boeing's largest airliner, is notably in direct competition on long-haul routes with the  Airbus A380 , a full-length  double-deck aircraft  now in service. For airlines seeking very large passenger airliners, the two have been pitched as  competitors  on various occasions. Boeing states that the 747-8 is more than 10 percent lighter per seat and is to consume 11 percent less fuel per passenger than the A380, translating into a trip-cost reduction of 21 percent and a seat-mile cost reduction of over 6 percent.
90_6	CAR_cf435ec8bb05cd7b2a59723327748b449f5e396d	Rival performance claims by Airbus and Boeing appear to be contradictory, their methodologies unclear and neither are validated by a third party source.  Boeing claims the 747-8I to be over 10% lighter per seat and have 11% less fuel consumption per passenger, with a trip-cost reduction of 21% and a seat-mile cost reduction of more than 6%, compared to the A380. The 747-8F's empty weight is expected to be 80 tonnes (88 tons) lighter and 24% lower fuel burnt per ton with 21% lower trip costs and 23% lower ton-mile costs than the A380F. On the other hand, Airbus claims the A380 to have 8% less fuel consumption per passenger than the 747-8I and in 2007 Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per passenger than the airline's  747-400  fleet. Emirates'  Tim Clark  also claims that the A380 is more fuel economic at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83. One independent, industry analysis shows fuel consumption in litres per seat per 100 kilometres flown (L/seat/100 km) as 3.27 for the A380 and 3.35 for the B747-8I, or a fuel cost per seat mile of $0.055 and $0.057 respectively. A possible, as yet uncommitted, re-engined A380neo is expected to achieve  2.82 or 2.65 L/seat/100 km depending on the options taken.
90_6	CAR_e2bddcdd987cdaeddef4ec2bcfb637d022267cd5	The  A320  has been selected by 222 operators (Dec. 2008), among these several  low-cost operators , gaining ground against the previously well established  737  in this sector; it has also been selected as a replacement for  727 s and aging  737 s by many full-service airlines such as  Star Alliance  members  United Airlines ,  Air Canada  and  Lufthansa . After dominating the very large aircraft market for four decades, the Boeing 747 now faces a challenge from the A380. In response, Boeing now offer the stretched and updated  747-8 , with greater capacity, fuel efficiency, and longer range. Frequent delays to the Airbus A380 program caused several customers to consider cancelling their orders in favour of the refreshed 747-8. However, all orders for the  A380F  freight variant have been cancelled. To date, Boeing has secured orders for 78 747-8F and 51 747-8I aircraft with first deliveries originally scheduled for 2011 and 2012 as the 747-8I is only in service with  Lufthansa , while Airbus has orders for 318 A380s, the first of which entered service in 2007 and has delivered a total of 152 to customers (as of December 31, 2014).
90_6	CAR_f5d415c4985b3b54578016913336ac3c40019b21	In 1988,  Boeing  bought the company in a bid to improve production at DHC's  Downsview Airport  plants, as well as better position itself to compete for a new  Air Canada  order for large intercontinental airliners. Air Canada was a  Crown corporation  at the time, and both Boeing and  Airbus  were competing heavily via political channels for the contract. It was eventually won by Airbus, which received an order for 34 A320 aircraft in a highly controversial move. The allegations of bribery are today known as the  Airbus affair . Following its failure in the competition, Boeing immediately put de Havilland Canada up for sale. The company was eventually purchased by Bombardier in 1992.
90_7	CAR_0dbae406fe1af0993211fbb3919a495dbe77cd0a	The 777X will have a new larger wingspan composite wing with folding wing tips. The internal cabin width is increased to  from the  width of previous 777 models, through the use of thinner interior cabin walls and better insulation. This will allow 10-abreast economy seating with  wide seats.
90_7	CAR_156a6b9871f821ecc3ca8812fdd59e5df386e2e3	The 737-900ER (ER for extended range), which was called the 737-900X prior to launch, is the newest addition and the largest variant of the Boeing 737 line and was introduced to meet the range and passenger capacity of the discontinued  757-200  and to directly compete with the  Airbus A321 .  An additional pair of exit doors and a flat  rear pressure bulkhead  increased seating capacity to 180 passengers in a 2-class configuration or 220 passengers in a single-class layout though some airlines seal the additional exit. Additional fuel capacity and standard winglets improved range to that of other 737NG variants.
90_7	CAR_15b6250875ca9c9e253d17e78b2d6d3c03347246	In the 1980s the Boeing 727 was discontinued, as its central engine bay would require a prohibitively expensive redesign to accommodate quieter high-bypass turbofans, and it was soon supplanted by twinjets for the narrow-body market; Airbus with the  A320 , and Boeing with the  757  and updated "classic" variants of the  737 . During that decade only  McDonnell Douglas  continued development of the trijet design with an update to the  DC-10 , the  MD-11 , which initially had a range advantage over its closest medium wide-body competitors which were twinjets, the in-production Boeing 767 and upcoming Airbus 330. In contrast to McDonnell Douglas sticking with their existing trijet configuration, Airbus (which never produced a trijet aircraft) and Boeing worked on new widebody twinjet designs that would become the Airbus A330 and Boeing 777, respectively. The MD-11's long range advantage was brief as it was soon nullified by the Airbus A330's four-engine derivative, the  Airbus A340 , and the extended-range Boeing 767-300ER and Boeing 777-200ER.

90_7	CAR_2fb447dd30dbf82794c1fe4ae2e156f1e5ac82de	By the late 2000s, the 777 was facing increased potential competition from Airbus' planned A350 XWB and internally from proposed 787 variants, both airliners that promise fuel efficiency improvements. As a consequence, the 777-300ER received an engine and aerodynamics improvement package for reduced drag and weight. In 2010, the variant further received a   maximum zero-fuel weight  increase, equivalent to a higher payload of 20–25 passengers; its GE90-115B1 engines received a 1–2.5 percent thrust enhancement for increased takeoff weights at higher-altitude airports. More changes were targeted for late 2012, including possible extension of the  wingspan , along with other major changes, including a composite wing, new powerplant, and different fuselage lengths. Emirates was reportedly working closely with Boeing on the project, possibly being the launch customer for new 777 versions.  China Airlines  ordered ten 777-300ER aircraft to replace 747-400s on routes between  Taipei  and  Los Angeles  and  New York City , telling Aviation Week and Space Technology that the 777-300ER's per seat cost is about 20% lower than the 747's costs (varying due to fuel prices). Four of the 777 aircraft were already flying as of February 2015.

90_7	CAR_9e109eab7e1a0fe4beb7db525c75ce1f385aec37	In April 1994, Boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time, the twin-engine  777 , with a  seating capacity  of approximately 300 to 370 passengers in a typical three-class layout, in between the 767 and the 747. The longest range twin-engined aircraft in the world, the 777 was the first Boeing airliner to feature a " fly-by-wire " system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the European Airbus into Boeing's traditional market. This aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using  computer-aided design  (CAD) techniques. The 777 was also the first airplane to be certified for 180 minute  ETOPS  at entry into service by the  FAA .  Also in the mid-1990s, the company developed the revamped version of the 737, known as the  737 "Next-Generation" , or 737NG.

90_7	CAR_f9212cf9ae0b773e4cd2b0cac1f026fe6d68b93d	In 2013, Airbus said, for long haul flights, there should be an industry standard for a minimum seat width of 18-inches in economy cabins, but its rival Boeing argued it was up for airlines to decide. People get bigger as a result of change in diets, the weight of the average American male in his 40s has increased by 10 percent between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747  defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century. The narrower 17 inches wide seat favoured by Boeing is a legacy from the 1950s when passenger jets were first introduced. In the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of the Boeing 747 and the first Airbus jets, 18-inches become standard for long-haul flights. Seats were widened to 18.5 inches with the Boeing 777 in the 1990s and A380 superjumbo in the 2000s. Many airlines are adopting lighter 17-inch-wide seats on their Boeing 777 and 787 and 18-inch seats for A350s. Although for almost 20 years, the standard setup in the back of a Boeing 777 was nine seats per row, in 2012 nearly 70% of the biggest version of that plane were delivered with 10-abreast seating. When Airbus introduced its A380, it offered 10-abreast seating, giving each passenger up to 19 inches of hip space. In 2013, ten airlines fly Airbus A330 with nine 16.7-inch seats in each row, rather than the eight it was designed for. A research commissioned by Airbus shows an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.

The right of access only mandates that the data subject gets to see their personal data. The old EU Data Protection Directive used to require explicitly in such cases for the data to be provided in "intelligible" form, which has been interpreted so far as "human readable". This requirement is still somewhat present in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, but only implicitly in conjunction with the Recitals. Since the right to portability is mostly concerned with reuse by other services (i.e. most likely automated), it could be that both "human readable" and "raw format" would be inappropriate for effective data portability. Some intermediate level might need to be sought.

For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes. "For the Net generation, social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off. However, because such forums are relatively easy to access, posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users' personal information". The UK government has plans to monitor traffic on social networks. As well, schemes similar to e-mail jamming have been proposed for networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These would involve "friending" and "following" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures  openness ,  extraversion , and  conscientiousness  were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while  neuroticism  decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.

In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.

The core challenge in data privacy is to share data while protecting personal information. Public cloud storage services, such as  Google ,  Amazon ,  Microsoft  and  Dropbox , do not offer the same level of protection for personal information that would be available if that information is kept in your home or office, according to a report by the World Privacy Forum. The report found that “information stored by a business or an individual with a third party may have fewer or weaker privacy or other protections than information in the possession of the creator of the information.”  The report goes on to state that “both government agencies and private litigants may be able to obtain information from a third party more easily than from the creator of the information.”

The cloud service provider needs to establish clear and relevant policies that describe how the data of each cloud user will be accessed and used.  Cloud service users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access. Cryptographic encryption mechanisms are certainly the best options. In addition, authentication and integrity protection mechanisms ensure that data only goes where the customer wants it to go and it is not modified in transit.

Crypto cloud computing protects individual’s connections with the outside world. It can protect the personal privacy without any delay of information exchange.
91_3	CAR_6bca7c398960273b4182833a4b820348ce35d009	Social network  is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other  social interactions  between actors. Privacy concerns with social networking services is a subset of  data privacy , involving the right of mandating personal privacy concerning storing, re-purposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Social network security and privacy issues result from the astronomical amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in—messages, invitations, photos, open  platform  applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user’s information may intrude their privacy. More specifically, In the case of Facebook. Adrienne Felt, a Ph.D. candidate at  Berkeley , made small headlines last year when she exposed a potentially devastating hole in the framework of Facebook's  third-party   application programming interface  (API). It made it easier for people to lose their privacy. Felt and her co-researchers found that third-party platform applications on Facebook are provided with far more user information than it is needed. This potential privacy breach is actually built into the systematic framework of Facebook. Unfortunately, the flaws render the system to be almost indefensible. "The question for social networks is resolving the difference between mistakes in implementation and what the design of the application platform is intended to allow," said David Evans, Assistant Professor of  Computer Science  at  the University of Virginia . Moreover, there is also the question of who should be held responsible for the lack of user privacy? According to Evan, the answer to the question is not likely to be found, because a better regulated API would be required for Facebook "to break a lot of applications, [especially when] a lot of companies are trying to make money off [these] applications." Felt agrees with her conclusion, because "there are marketing businesses built on top of the idea that third parties can get access to data and user information on Facebook."

All forms of  lifelog ging also carry privacy implications. Social networks associated with activity trackers have led to breaches of privacy such as involuntary publication of sexual activity, and the potential for advertisers and health insurers to access private health data through the devices is a concern.
91_3	CAR_761c25485274b62384102d5c4fc4f1445b5aa9a6	The increased use of cloud computing services such as Gmail and Google Docs has pressed the issue of privacy concerns of cloud computing services to the utmost importance.  The provider of such services lie in a position such that with the greater use of cloud computing services has given access to a plethora of data.  This access has the immense risk of data being disclosed either accidentally or deliberately.  Privacy advocates have criticized the cloud model for giving hosting companies' greater ease to control—and thus, to monitor at will—communication between host company and end user, and access user data (with or without permission). Instances such as the  secret NSA program , working with  AT&T , and  Verizon , which recorded over 10 million telephone calls between American citizens, causes uncertainty among privacy advocates, and the greater powers it gives to telecommunication companies to monitor user activity. A cloud service provider (CSP) can complicate data privacy because of the extent of virtualization (virtual machines) and  cloud storage  used to implement cloud service. CSP operations, customer or tenant data may not remain on the same system, or in the same data center or even within the same provider's cloud; this can lead to legal concerns over jurisdiction.  While there have been efforts (such as  US-EU Safe Harbor ) to "harmonise" the legal environment, providers such as Amazon still cater to major markets (typically to the United States and the  European Union ) by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select "regions and availability zones".Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is on the cloud at any time.  It could accidentally or deliberately alter or even delete information. This becomes a major concern as these service providers employ administrators, which can leave room for potential unwanted disclosure of information on the cloud.
91_3	CAR_801645c8124f50e61922ae98ff83eeaafcedbe82	Social networking  sites offer greater security risks to personal electronic information because sensitive, private or confidential information such as  personal identifier s are routinely used to create public profiles. Many websites give options to suppress the amount of personal information revealed through the customisation of privacy settings. However privacy settings can reset if changes to the website occur.

Due to the increasing capabilities of mobile devices, however, geospatial computing in mobile devices is a fast-growing trend. The portable nature of these devices, as well as the presence of useful sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and barometric pressure sensors, make them useful for capturing and processing geospatial information in the field. In addition to the local processing of geospatial information on mobile devices, another growing trend is cloud-based geospatial computing. In this architecture, data can be collected in the field using mobile devices and then transmitted to cloud-based servers for further processing and ultimate storage. In a similar manner, geospatial information can be made available to connected mobile devices via the cloud, allowing access to vast databases of geospatial information anywhere where a wireless data connection is available.

91_3	CAR_a9908015478cbd32ba02fc526268ac6947d88f76	Evidence that cloud computing had begun to take hold in Canada by 2009 is reflected in the organization of the first Canadian Cloud Computing Conference held on 9 February of that year, in Toronto.  Cloud computing  involves the use of information processing and data storage on computers that are located away from the site of the user and owner of the data. The user, a corporation or individual, communicates with the remote computer through the Internet. The growing popularity of the small  netbook  computer is in part due to the fact that it is ideally suited to take advantage of cloud computing. The technique allows the user to focus more on processing and storage than on equipment and software acquisition and maintenance. However, it also raises questions relating to privacy and security, in that confidential data may be transmitted, processed and stored on facilities beyond the geographic reach of the owner of the data. Cloud computing providers offer three types of service,  platform-as-a-service  (PaaS),  software-as-a-service  (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). As of 2009, Toronto area companies appeared to be the leaders of cloud computing in Canada. An initiative based in Kitchener/Waterloo has brought together a group of computer service providers to create Canadian Cloud Computing, which has developed the Trusted Canadian Cloud. This cloud computing service, which uses facilities based exclusively in Canada, was first demonstrated at Canada 3.0 Digital Media Conference held in Stratford, Ontario in 2010.

Researchers, however, have found new security threats open up as a result. Some of these security and privacy threats include  hacker s,  viruses , and  worms .  These privacy threats are made more prominent by the emergence of " Cloud Computing ," which is the use of shared computer processing power.  Health care organizations are increasingly using cloud computing as a way to handle large amounts of data.  This type of  data storage , however, is susceptible to  natural disaster s,  cybercrime  and technological terrorism, and hardware failure.  Health information breaches accounted for the 39 percent of all breaches in 2015.
91_3	CAR_bd95fbb04802baff2a1d66b68fad8b480278fe53	The relative security of cloud computing services is a contentious issue that may be delaying its adoption. Physical control of the Private Cloud equipment is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone else's control. Physical control and the ability to visually inspect data links and access ports is required in order to ensure data links are not compromised. Issues barring the adoption of cloud computing are due in large part to the private and public sectors' unease surrounding the external management of security-based services. It is the very nature of cloud computing-based services, private or public, that promote external management of provided services. This delivers great incentive to cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services. Security issues have been categorised into sensitive data access, data segregation, privacy, bug exploitation, recovery, accountability, malicious insiders, management console security, account control, and multi-tenancy issues. Solutions to various cloud security issues vary, from cryptography, particularly public key infrastructure (PKI), to use of multiple cloud providers, standardisation of APIs, and improving virtual machine support and legal support.
91_3	CAR_c25701ae16a01c8472c5fb292102d6e1eb18465f	Privacy concerns with social networking services  have been raised growing concerns among users on the dangers of giving out too much personal information and the threat of  sexual predators . Users of these services also need to be aware of  data theft  or  viruses . However, large services, such as  Myspace  and  Netlog , often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site  Quechup  harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a  spamming  operation.

Furthermore (and unlike the current Directive) the Regulation also applies to organizations based outside the European Union if they process personal data of EU residents. The regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement ("competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties"). According to the European Commission "personal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life. It can be anything from a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer’s IP address."

91_5	CAR_6c47eb74e459d7c83ccda62959ea9c64c255e4bc	Since early 2012, the European Union has been working on a  General Data Protection Regulation  to replace the  Data Protection Directive  and harmonise data protection and privacy law. On 20 October 2013, a committee at the  European Parliament  backed the measure, which, if it is enacted, could require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of  revelations about a far-reaching spying program  by the  U.S. National Security Agency . European Union justice and rights commissioner Viviane Reding said "The question has arisen whether the large-scale collection and processing of personal information under US surveillance programmes is necessary and proportionate to meet the interests of national security." The EU is also asking the US for changes to US legislation to match the legal redress offered in Europe; American citizens in Europe can go to the courts if they feel their rights are infringed but Europeans without right of residence in America cannot. When the EU / US arrangement to implement  International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles  were struck down by the European Court of Justice, a new framework for transatlantic data flows, called the "EU-US Privacy Shield", was adopted in July 2016.
91_5	CAR_7d2ea6ae66a2a7a0b6d7d5d317054da39bb61a9a	In 1995 the  European Union  adopted the  European Data Protection Directive  (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data. This is now considered a component of  human rights law . The new European Proposal for  General Data Protection Regulation  provides protection and exemption for companies listed as "media" companies, like newspapers and other journalistic work. However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a "media" company and so is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a "data controller" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These "data controllers" are required under EU law to remove data that is "inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant", making this directive of global importance.
91_5	CAR_c245a3f333f8a0b6cc2bf7ec9f63867677e35812	Because of this, in theory the transfer of personal information from the EU to the US is prohibited when equivalent privacy protection is not in place in the US.   American companies that would work with EU data must comply with the Safe Harbour framework.  The core principles of data protected are limited collection, consent of the subject, accuracy, integrity, security, subject right of review and deletion.  As a result, customers of international organizations such as Amazon and eBay in the EU have the ability to review and delete information, while Americans do not.  In the United States the equivalent guiding philosophy is the  Code of Fair Information Practice  (FIP).
91_5	CAR_f16e6067f3feb50c5c6e49aa9531fbb5047a5916	The regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans-Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the  Safe Harbor  agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes. Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the "third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection," meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection. The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to "opt out" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected. Given the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous digital privacy regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to "opt out" and afford other protections.

Further, most current social networks afford their users little control over content that they did not post themselves. In its  privacy policy , Facebook states that any information posted using its service, including images, may be used to display relevant ads to its users. Facebook utilizes automatic facial recognition software that can automatically recognize the face of another Facebook user in new photos, and suggest that the user be tagged in the photo. A  Ghent University  study found that employers commonly search for prosepective employees on Facebook, and may decide whether or not to grant an  interview  based on the person's profile picture.

Susan B. Barnes firstly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media. When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page. She termed this phenomenon as "privacy paradox".

There have been situations where students have been forced to give up their social media passwords to school administrators.  There are inadequate laws to protect a student's social media privacy, and organizations such as the ACLU are pushing for more privacy protection, as it is an invasion. They urge students who are pressured to give up their account information to tell the administrators to contact a parent and/or lawyer before they take the matter any further. Although they are students, they still have the right to keep their password-protected information private.

Beacon hurt Facebook’s reputation by violating its Software Engineering tenets and disrespecting the privacy rights of its users. Since the failure of launching Beacon, Facebook has been mired in controversy in terms of privacy issues. The Beacon stories allowed Internet surfers to believe that Facebook and other profit-oriented social networking sites are “large Internet-based surveillance machines”.
91_6	CAR_163e489fd6a7a1ead361b7507a2c26e5baea9b1c	Many social networking organizations have responded to criticism and concerns over privacy.  It is claimed that changes to default settings, the storage of data and sharing with third parties have all been updated and corrected in the light of criticism, and/or legal challenges.  However, many critics remain unsatisfied, noting that fundamental changes to privacy settings in many social networking sites remain minor, and argue that social networking companies prefer to criticize users rather than adapt their policies.
91_6	CAR_17e18a95aa7892169934f8befe9432bb8e33b31c	Privacy issues associated with social networking sites can be seen from many perspectives. Some people will argue that this is just a part of globalization and the growth of technology, while others will still believe that it is a right for any citizen, and will never change their views and perspectives about their privacy. With the increase in popularity of social networking, many users have given up their personal privacy in order to join these networks. Social media privacy issues didn’t begin with social networking sites; they have historically been persistent issues with many other types of social media such as text messaging, instant messaging and computer-supported collaboration work.
91_6	CAR_1cd5ff24ac7c2e3f4201e3d976164340cb5822b0	Social networking sites vary in the levels of privacy offered.  For some social networking sites like Facebook, providing real names and other personal information is encouraged by the site(onto a page known as a ‘Profile‘).  This information usually consists of birth date, current address, and telephone number(s).  Some sites also allow users to provide more information about themselves such as interests, hobbies, favorite books or films, and even relationship status. However, there are other social network sites, such as  Match.com , where most people prefer to be anonymous.  Thus, linking users to their real identity can sometimes be rather difficult.  Nevertheless,  individuals can sometimes be identified with face re-identification.  Studies have been done on two major social networking sites, and it is found that by overlapping 15% of the similar photographs, profile pictures with similar pictures over multiple sites can be matched to identify the users.
91_6	CAR_1f47b2dbcc66d71971e3b24398dc0927bb9c6135	Monitoring of social networking sites is not limited to potential workers.  Issues relating to privacy are becoming an increasing concern for those currently in employment.  A number of high-profile cases have appeared in which individuals have been sacked for posting comments on social networking which have been considered disparaging to their current employers or fellow workers.  In 2009, sixteen-year-old Kimberley Swann was sacked from her position at Ivell Marketing and Logistics Limited after describing her job as ‘boring’.  In 2008, Virgin Atlantic sacked thirteen cabin crew staff, after it emerged they used had criticized the company’s safety standards and called passengers ‘chavs’ on Facebook. There is no federal law that we are aware of that an employer is breaking by monitoring employees on social networking sites. In fact, employers can even hire third-party companies to monitor online employee activity for them. According to an article by Read Write Web employers use the service to "make sure that employees don't leak sensitive information on social networks or engage in any behavior that could damage a company's reputation." While employers may have found such usages of social networking sites convenient, complaints have been put forward by civil liberties groups and trade unions on the invasive approach adopted by many employers.  In response to the Kimberley Swann case, Brendan Barber, of the  TUC  union stated that:

Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.
91_6	CAR_25387db808afa7bd455e54d7f7622239a553afe9	Privacy on social networking sites can be undermined by many factors. For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes. "For the Net generation, social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off. However, because such forums are relatively easy to access, posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users' personal information". The UK government has plans to monitor traffic on social networks. As well, schemes similar to e-mail jamming have been proposed for networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These would involve "friending" and "following" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures  openness ,  extraversion , and  conscientiousness  were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while  neuroticism  decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.
91_6	CAR_2cc2ca7b49868609a6cea932e745e8c1ce7cfdff	The survey results of the paper suggest, "These results show that the interaction of trust and privacy concern in social networking sites is not yet understood to a sufficient degree to allow accurate modeling of behavior and activity. The results of the study encourage further research in the effort to understand the development of relationships in the online social environment and the reasons for differences in behavior on different sites."
91_6	CAR_350158d57f1ad7999eda2e1e994253617a3b5618	With the amount of data available about individuals accessible by many sources, privacy has become a major concern. Security breaches of customer and other social information such as the compromise of more than 56 million  Home Depot  customers’ credit card information  have impacted the concern of privacy with social data. How companies are using and the potential misuse of the personal information gathered is a concern for the majority of consumers. Despite this, many people do not know how social networking sites and other sources are using and selling their data.  In 2014 study, only 25% of online users knew that their location could be accessed and only 14% knew that their web-surfing history could be accessed and shared.
91_6	CAR_36359f113734687b4a514d8d325feac5a490d09b	In 2013 a class action lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user messages for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA also referred to as the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private.  It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open.  This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago.  In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, peoples interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and it is important to consider that when interacting online.  New forms of social networking and digital media such as  Instagram  and  Snapchat  may call for new guidelines regarding privacy.  What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances.  Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics.  No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.

Further, there have been investigations into parental behavior that is enacted through online social media; specifically when parents 'friend' their children and the management of privacy that ensues from that. Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. Some study explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation.
91_6	CAR_4b135f2d5b57633ae3f8a35e00a49ec60263093d	In the digital information era, where social networks are increasingly used for sharing, communicating and entertaining, citizens' fundamental rights can be at risk. The creation of accounts that reveal data and personal information may lead to a violation of the right to intimacy, privacy, image and honour. The risk is caused by the user's lack of knowledge regarding the terms and conditions of social networks, and the possible uses of the information by third parties.
91_6	CAR_52a611997e85146eba21f35ba95c3a043ec88172	Government and local authorities rely on Facebook and other social networks to investigate crimes and obtain evidence to help establish a crime, provide location information, establish motives, prove and disprove alibis, and reveal communications. Federal, state, and local investigations have not been restricted to profiles that are publicly available or willingly provided to the government; Facebook has willingly provided information in response to government subpoenas or requests, except with regard to private, unopened inbox messages less than 181 days old, which require a warrant and a finding of probable cause under federal law. An article by Junichi Semitsu published in the ''Pace Law Review'', reports that "even when the government lacks reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and the user opts for the strictest privacy controls, Facebook users still cannot expect federal law to stop their 'private' content and communications from being used against them. " Facebook's privacy policy states that "We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities." Since Congress has failed to meaningfully amend the  Electronic Communications Privacy Act  to protect most communications on social-networking sites such as Facebook and since the Supreme Court has largely refused to recognize a Fourth Amendment privacy right to information shared with a third party, there is no federal statutory or constitutional right that prevents the government from issuing requests that amount to fishing expeditions and there is no Facebook privacy policy that forbids the company from handing over private user information that suggests any illegal activity.

91_6	CAR_5690286bb3907c757ee0e678bd7274a7bbcaaca0	Several issues pertaining to Facebook are due to privacy concerns. An article titled, Facebook and Online Privacy: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Unintended Consequences, examines the awareness that Facebook users have on privacy issues. This study shows that the gratifications of using Facebook tend to outweigh the perceived threats to privacy. The most common strategy for privacy protection – decreasing profile visibility through restricting access to friends – is also a very weak mechanism; a quick fix rather than a systematic approach to protecting privacy. This study suggests that more education about privacy on Facebook would be beneficial to the majority of the Facebook user population.
91_6	CAR_56f71a76a8aa491a20e0792046dabf1b3a8f447e	These  social network s keep track of all interactions used on their sites and save them for later use. Issues include  cyberstalking , location disclosure, social profiling, 3rd party personal information disclosure, and government  use of social network websites in investigations  without the safeguard of a  search warrant .
91_6	CAR_5b5c3a6a5173dc900509fdf0f8c5656bae0750b0	In December 2013, High-Tech Bridge research on privacy in popular social networks and email services was cited in a  class action  lawsuit for allegedly violating its members' privacy by scanning private messages sent on the social network.

In hope of regaining users from Facebook, MySpace is now simplifying their privacy settings. "The change is part of MySpace's new public commitment to privacy." The new privacy settings will allow users to restrict who sees their profile by limiting the accessibility to friends only, or people 18 or older. "Some people may have a private gathering in someone's home - that doesn't mean they're inviting everyone who happens to be friends of friends who are invited," said, Jeremy Mishkin, a partner and Internet privacy expert at the law firm Montgomery McCracken in Philadelphia. Third-party sites gaining access to user's personal private information has been a recurring theme amongst these social networks. Providing a safe social network with proper privacy settings, while also allowing users to be as social as they want, is the ideal system for all social media users.
91_6	CAR_6bca7c398960273b4182833a4b820348ce35d009	Social network  is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other  social interactions  between actors. Privacy concerns with social networking services is a subset of  data privacy , involving the right of mandating personal privacy concerning storing, re-purposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Social network security and privacy issues result from the astronomical amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in—messages, invitations, photos, open  platform  applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user’s information may intrude their privacy. More specifically, In the case of Facebook. Adrienne Felt, a Ph.D. candidate at  Berkeley , made small headlines last year when she exposed a potentially devastating hole in the framework of Facebook's  third-party   application programming interface  (API). It made it easier for people to lose their privacy. Felt and her co-researchers found that third-party platform applications on Facebook are provided with far more user information than it is needed. This potential privacy breach is actually built into the systematic framework of Facebook. Unfortunately, the flaws render the system to be almost indefensible. "The question for social networks is resolving the difference between mistakes in implementation and what the design of the application platform is intended to allow," said David Evans, Assistant Professor of  Computer Science  at  the University of Virginia . Moreover, there is also the question of who should be held responsible for the lack of user privacy? According to Evan, the answer to the question is not likely to be found, because a better regulated API would be required for Facebook "to break a lot of applications, [especially when] a lot of companies are trying to make money off [these] applications." Felt agrees with her conclusion, because "there are marketing businesses built on top of the idea that third parties can get access to data and user information on Facebook."
91_6	CAR_7a58d89d7cb8cef237ec307e53e799f226e28ae7	Issues relating to privacy and employment are becoming a concern with regards to social networking sites. As of 2008, it has been estimated by  CareerBuilder.com  that one in five employers search social networking sites in order to screen potential candidates (increasing from only 11% in 2006).  For the majority of employers, such action is to acquire negative information about candidates.  For example, 41% of managers considered information relating to candidates’ alcohol and drug use to be a top concern.   Other concerns investigated via social networking sites included poor communication skills, inappropriate photographs, inaccurate qualifications and bad-mouthing former employers/colleagues.  However, 24% manager claimed that information found on a social networking site persuaded them to hire a candidate, suggesting that a user image can be used in a positive way.
91_6	CAR_7bcaa2acda7432cd507ff4f10f178db4af816954	The study also offers the perspective that most users do not realize that restricting access to their data does not sufficiently address the risks resulting from the amount, quality and persistence of data they provide. Facebook users in our study report familiarity and use of privacy settings, they are still accepting people as "friends" that they have only heard of through other or do not know at all and, therefore, most have very large groups of "friends" that have access to widely uploaded information such as full names, birthdates, hometowns, and many pictures.  This study suggests that social network privacy does not merely exist within the realm of privacy settings, but privacy control is much within the hands of the user. Commentators have noted that online social networking poses a fundamental challenge to the theory of privacy as control. The stakes have been raised because digital technologies lack "the relative transience of human memory," and can be trolled or data mined for information. For users who are unaware of all privacy concerns and issues, further education on the safety of disclosing certain types of information on Facebook is highly recommended.
91_6	CAR_7bda7499402e79e8a2b539c13ce93d8bc2b56e2c	Safety issues (including  security , privacy, and trust) in mobile social networks are concerned about the condition of being protected against different types of failure, damage, error, accidents, harm or any other non-desirable event, while mobile carriers contact each other in mobile environments. However, lack of a protective infrastructure in these networks has turned them in to convenient targets for various perils. This is the main impulse why MSNs carry disparate and intricate safety concerns and embrace divergent safety challenging problems.
91_6	CAR_7bf8e5ba0ede41788e45496b46b21abc6632b0a7	Social networking  sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms. These website's leaders believe this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences.  On-line bullies  may make use of personal information to harass or  stalk  users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners. Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential  facial recognition technology , it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Because of image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.
91_6	CAR_801645c8124f50e61922ae98ff83eeaafcedbe82	Social networking  sites offer greater security risks to personal electronic information because sensitive, private or confidential information such as  personal identifier s are routinely used to create public profiles. Many websites give options to suppress the amount of personal information revealed through the customisation of privacy settings. However privacy settings can reset if changes to the website occur.

However a major issue with privacy relates back to social networking. For example, there are millions of users on Facebook and regulations have changed. People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or most of the time unexpectedly by others. It is important to be cautious of what is being said over the internet and what information is being displayed as well as photos because this all can searched across the web and used to access private databases making it easy for anyone to quickly go online and profile a person.
91_6	CAR_980b66a747c3aed91ad5601af4cc8d40c47c0d1d	The advent of the  Web 2.0  has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for Internet privacy. Web 2.0 is the system that facilitates participatory information sharing and collaboration on the Internet, in  social networking  media websites like  Facebook ,  Instagram , Twitter, and  MySpace . These social networking sites have seen a boom in their popularity starting from the late 2000s. Through these websites many people are giving their personal information out on the internet.
91_6	CAR_986a32e3256e196348cb42db28656a02f43e5834	Prior to the social networking site explosion over the past decade, there were early forms of social network technologies that included online multiplayer games, blog sites, news groups, mailings lists and dating services. These all created a backbone for the new modern sites, and even from the start of these older versions privacy was an issue. In 1996, a young woman in New York City was on a first date with an online acquaintance and later sued for sexual harassment, after her date tried to play out some of the sexual fantasies they had discussed while online. This is just an early example of many more issues to come regarding internet privacy.

91_6	CAR_b5640a90daa379d3e6f7d1b58ed2bb811e3d851a	Facebook’s privacy settings have greatly evolved and are continuing to change over time.  Zuckerberg “believes the age of privacy is ‘over,’ and that norms have evolved considerably since he first co-founded the social networking site.”   Additionally, Facebook has been under fire for keeping track of one’s Internet usage whether users are logged in to the social media site or not.  A user may notice personalized ads under the 'Sponsored' area of the page.  “The company uses cookies to log data such as the date, time, URL, and your IP address whenever you visit a site that has a Facebook plug-in, such as a ‘Like’ button.”.  Facebook claims this data is used to help improve one’s experience on the website and to protect against ‘malicious’ activity.  Another issue of privacy that Facebook uses is the new facial recognition software.  This feature includes the software to identify photos that users are tagged in by developing a template based on one’s facial features.
91_6	CAR_b95c63a9b9057b9853cc4e5fb938989f513bbd2d	For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via  S/MIME  or  PGP ) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like  I2P  and  Tor  can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party  HTTP cookies , Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at  Florida International University  and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies."  As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to  behavioral advertising .Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short". This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.

It allowed users to set up a profile, upload photos and videos, connect and communicate with friends. Many other utilities, such as a chat application, the ability to create events and tagging locations and places were also offered in the beginning. Unlike similar social networking sites which feature  banner advertisements , Tuenti opted out of these traditional forms of obstructive and invasive advertising, in order to respect the privacy of the user.

People using these sites were seen as “techies” unlike users in the current era. One of the early privacy cases was in regards to  MySpace , due to “stalking of minors, bullying, and privacy issues,” which inevitably led to the adoption of “age requirements and other safety measures”. It is very common in society now for events such as stalking and “ catfishing ” to occur, hence the reason security has become such a prominent topic.
91_6	CAR_c25701ae16a01c8472c5fb292102d6e1eb18465f	Privacy concerns with social networking services  have been raised growing concerns among users on the dangers of giving out too much personal information and the threat of  sexual predators . Users of these services also need to be aware of  data theft  or  viruses . However, large services, such as  Myspace  and  Netlog , often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site  Quechup  harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a  spamming  operation.
91_6	CAR_c55b71f291c8314bd8dcc00039be69687ef7a306	It has been a topic of discussion of who is held accountable for the collection and distribution of personal information.  Some will say that it is the fault of the social networks because they are the ones who are storing the vast amounts of information and data, but others claim that it is the users who are responsible for the issue because it is the users themselves that provide the information in the first place.  This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites.  There is a growing number of people that are discovering the risks of putting their personal information online and trusting a website to keep it private.
91_6	CAR_c86e397e962c6546be73cc24f8b04441e1e9866f	Other privacy concerns with employers and social media are when employers use social media as a tool to screen a prospective employee. This issue raises many ethical questions that some consider an employer's right and others consider  discrimination . Except in the states of California, Maryland, and Illinois, there are no laws that prohibit employers from using social media profiles as a basis of whether or not someone should be hired.  Title VII  also prohibits discrimination during any aspect of employment including hiring or firing, recruitment, or testing. Social media has been integrating into the workplace and this has led to conflicts within employees and employers. Particularly, Facebook has been seen as a popular platform for employers to investigate in order to learn more about potential employees. This conflict first started in Maryland when an employer requested and received an employee's Facebook username and password. State lawmakers first introduced legislation in 2012 to prohibit employers from requesting passwords to personal social accounts in order to get a job or to keep a job. This led to Canada, Germany, the U.S. Congress and 11 U.S. states to pass or propose legislation that prevents employers' access to private social accounts of employees.
91_6	CAR_cd81be5152101677286d16cbeb491adb8b37cd59	Online communities like  social networking websites  have a very unclear distinction between private and public information. For most social networks, users have to give personal information to add to their profiles. Usually, users can control what type of information other people in the online community can access based on the users familiarity with the people or the users level of comfort. These limitations are known as "privacy settings". Privacy settings bring up the question of how privacy settings and terms of service affect the expectation of privacy in social media. After all, the purpose of an online community is to share a common space with one another. Furthermore, it is hard to take legal action when a user feels that his or her privacy has been invaded because he or she technically knew what the online community entailed. Creator of the social networking site  Facebook ,  Mark Zuckerberg , noticed a change in users' behavior from when he first initiated Facebook. It seemed that "society's willingness to share has created an environment where privacy concerns are less important to users of social networks today than they were when social networking began".  However even though a user might keep his or her personal information private, his or her activity is open to the whole web to access. When a user posts information to a site or comments or responds to information posted by others, social networking sites create a tracking record of the user's activity.
91_6	CAR_d5bc595d0267a7c775eb15104b7f3b93abdc1e60	There is also the lack of transparency and privacy with companies who collect and share their user's data. This is a critical issue with both the trust and belief of the data and its uses. Many social networks have argued that their user's forfeit part of their privacy in order to provide their service for free. Several of these companies choose not to fully disclose what data is collected and who it is shared with. When data is volunteered to companies it is difficult to know what companies have gain data about you and your online activity. Much of an individual's data is shared with websites and social networks in order to provide a more customized marketing experience. Many of those social networks may share your information with intelligent  agencies and authorities without a user's knowledge. Since the recent scandal involving Edward Snowden and National Security Agency it has been revealed that authorities may have access to more data from various devices and platforms. It has become very difficult to know what will happen with your data or what specifically has been collected. It is also important to recognize that while online users are worried about their information many of those same worries are not always applied to their activities or behavior. With social networks collecting a large amount of personal data such as birth date, legal name, sex, and photos there is an issue of dataveillance compromising confidentiality. Ultimately, dataveillance can comprise online anonymity.                         
91_6	CAR_db8436658af51cea10df47315c9acd5eb2b84bec	The connection of activity trackers with  social network s can lead to violation of  privacy , such as involuntary publication of sexual activity. The apps of some activity trackers not only transmit personal data, but also private address lists to servers on the Internet without notifying or asking the user.
91_6	CAR_eb36a69e42c657c28d965694b7e5c30ac211d4af	There is an ongoing discussion about what privacy means and if it is still needed. With the increase in social networking sites, more and more people are allowing their private information to be shared publicly. On the surface, this may be seen as someone listing private information about them on a social networking site, but below the surface, it is the site that could be sharing the information (not the individual). This is the idea of an Opt-In versus Opt-Out situation. There are many privacy statements that state whether there is an Opt-In or an Opt-Out policy. Typically an Opt-In privacy policy means that the individual has to tell the company issuing the privacy policy if they want their information shared or not. Opt-Out means that their information will be shared unless the individual tells the company not to share it.
91_6	CAR_f2f0eb8b13f0a3cc7c906f5a8f3d460ba11af03f	Privacy  issues are commonly reported in popular media. According to Gross and Acquisti (2005), “many individuals in a person’s online extended network would hardly be defined as actual friends by that person; in fact many may be complete strangers. And yet, personal and often sensitive information is freely and publicly provided.”  Therefore, users potentially expose themselves to physical and cyber risks.
91_6	CAR_f48bfd74ed48ba8a59894a772c527f1e501a2834	In the past, social networking services were viewed as a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks was a form of protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and it is not uncommon to be banned in junior high or high school computer labs.  Cyberbullying  has become an issue of concern with social networking services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and  cyberstalking . In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.Recent research suggests that there has been a shift in blocking the use of social networking services. In many cases, the opposite is occurring as the potential of online networking services is being realized. It has been suggested that if schools block them [social networking services], they're preventing students from learning the skills they need. Banning social networking […] is not only inappropriate but also borderline irresponsible when it comes to providing the best educational experiences for students. Schools and school districts have the option of educating safe media usage as well as incorporating  digital media  into the classroom experience, thus preparing students for the literacy they will encounter in the future.
91_7	CAR_104b5eda0e059a03681a0e76e80e3994c6b06af7	In Boidman’s opinion, “In the world of online, they can track you with cookies, they know where you’ve been and where you’re going next. It’s almost the same thing in real life.” “From a privacy standpoint, people are willing to give up information about themselves, as long as it’s aggregated and anonymous,” he says.  “They’re very comfortable [doing so] in order to get valuable information in return that’s going to help them. Our view is it’s the same thing online. Some people find it okay that they’re being tracked and certain targeted ads head their way.” 
91_7	CAR_1cd5ff24ac7c2e3f4201e3d976164340cb5822b0	Social networking sites vary in the levels of privacy offered.  For some social networking sites like Facebook, providing real names and other personal information is encouraged by the site(onto a page known as a ‘Profile‘).  This information usually consists of birth date, current address, and telephone number(s).  Some sites also allow users to provide more information about themselves such as interests, hobbies, favorite books or films, and even relationship status. However, there are other social network sites, such as  Match.com , where most people prefer to be anonymous.  Thus, linking users to their real identity can sometimes be rather difficult.  Nevertheless,  individuals can sometimes be identified with face re-identification.  Studies have been done on two major social networking sites, and it is found that by overlapping 15% of the similar photographs, profile pictures with similar pictures over multiple sites can be matched to identify the users.
91_7	CAR_25387db808afa7bd455e54d7f7622239a553afe9	Privacy on social networking sites can be undermined by many factors. For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes. "For the Net generation, social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off. However, because such forums are relatively easy to access, posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users' personal information". The UK government has plans to monitor traffic on social networks. As well, schemes similar to e-mail jamming have been proposed for networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These would involve "friending" and "following" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures  openness ,  extraversion , and  conscientiousness  were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while  neuroticism  decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.
91_7	CAR_2845ecb500c5e6784e623896fff102727af6ba08	Self-disclosure has been studied when it comes to face-to-face interactions. Since  social networking sites  are relatively new phenomena, there are not as many studies done about how people disclose information online compared to a one-on-one interaction. There have been surveys conducted about how social networking sites such as  Facebook ,  MySpace ,  Twitter ,  LinkedIn ,  hi5 ,  myyearbook , or  Friendster  affect interactions between human beings. On Facebook, users are able to determine their level and degree of self-disclosure by setting their privacy settings (McCarthy, 2009).  People achieve the breadth via posting about their everyday lives and sharing surface information while developing intimate relationships with great depth by sending private Facebook messages and creating closed groups.
91_7	CAR_3a06f99955e9e93a1c4259c5df6bd288b9b07897	Facebook  and other social networking tools are increasingly the object of scholarly research. Scholars in many fields have begun to investigate the impact of social networking sites, investigating how such sites may play into issues of  identity ,  privacy , social capital ,  youth culture , and  education . Research has also suggested that individuals add offline friends on  Facebook  to maintain contact and often this blurs the lines between work and home lives. According to a study in 2015, 63% of the users of Facebook or Twitter in the USA consider these networks to be their main source of news, with entertainment news being the most seen. In the times of breaking news, Twitter users are more likely to stay invested in the story. In some cases when the news story is more political, users may be more likely to voice their opinion on a linked Facebook story with a comment or like, while Twitter users will just follow the sites feed and/ or retweet the article.
91_7	CAR_3fbc02ea03323aa337d279c9078b5aecab5de7d7	Friendica was cited in January 2012 by Infoshop News as an "alternative to Google+ and Facebook" to be used on the  Occupy Nigeria  movement. In January 2012  Free Software Foundation Europe 's blog cited Friendica as a reasonable alternative to centralized and controlled social networks such as Facebook or Google+. Biblical Notes writer J. Randal Matheny described Friendica in January 2012 as "One social networking option flying under the radar until recently deserves consideration as an already stable platform with a wide range of options, applications, plug-ins, and possibilities for opening up the Internet." In February 2012, the German computer magazine  c't  wrote: "Friendica demonstrates how decentralized social networks can become widely accepted." Another German publication, the professional magazine  t3n  listed Friendica as a Facebook rival in an online article in March 2012 about Facebook alternatives. It compared Friendica with similar social networks like  Diaspora  and  identi.ca . MSN Tech & Gadgets contributor Emma Boyes wrote about Friendica in May 2012: "why you'll love it: you can use it to access all the other social networks and get recommendations of new friends and groups to join. Friendica is open source and decentralised. There's no corporation behind it and there are extensive privacy settings. You can choose from a variety of user interfaces and it boasts some cool features - for instance, being able to key in a list of your interests and use the 'profile match' feature to recommend other users who share them with you. A word of warning, though, the site is not as user-friendly as the others on this list, so it may be this one is one for the geeks."
91_7	CAR_5690286bb3907c757ee0e678bd7274a7bbcaaca0	Several issues pertaining to Facebook are due to privacy concerns. An article titled, Facebook and Online Privacy: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Unintended Consequences, examines the awareness that Facebook users have on privacy issues. This study shows that the gratifications of using Facebook tend to outweigh the perceived threats to privacy. The most common strategy for privacy protection – decreasing profile visibility through restricting access to friends – is also a very weak mechanism; a quick fix rather than a systematic approach to protecting privacy. This study suggests that more education about privacy on Facebook would be beneficial to the majority of the Facebook user population.
91_7	CAR_605fbec3ec6ea405c3a9ca62cf4a62b6f11624f2	According to Boyd and Ellison's (2007) article, "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life", social networking sites share a variety of technical features that allow individuals to: construct a public/semi-public profile, articulate a list of other users that they share a connection with, and view their list of connections within the system. The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of "friends" who are also users of the site. In an article entitled "Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship," Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of profiles as unique pages where one can "type oneself into being". A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or "Applications". Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.
91_7	CAR_654be5191f2fcb34583c1a01660dda23620838bd	One other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge. They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to "increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization." Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become "isolated and irrelevant". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships. They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing. This can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and knowledge sharing.Social Networks are used also to communicate scientists research results and as a public communication tool and to connect people who share the same professional interests, their benefits can vary according to the discipline. The most interesting aspects of social networks for professional purposes are their potentialities in terms of dissemination of information and the ability to reach and multiply professional contacts exponentially. Social networks like  Academia.edu ,  LinkedIn ,  Facebook , and  ResearchGate  give the possibility to join professional groups and pages, to share papers and results, publicize events, to discuss issues and create debates. Academia.edu is extensively used by researchers, where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms. ResearchGate is also widely used by researchers, especially to disseminate and discuss their publications, where it seems to attract an audience that it wider than just other scientists.
91_7	CAR_6bca7c398960273b4182833a4b820348ce35d009	Social network  is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other  social interactions  between actors. Privacy concerns with social networking services is a subset of  data privacy , involving the right of mandating personal privacy concerning storing, re-purposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Social network security and privacy issues result from the astronomical amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in—messages, invitations, photos, open  platform  applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user’s information may intrude their privacy. More specifically, In the case of Facebook. Adrienne Felt, a Ph.D. candidate at  Berkeley , made small headlines last year when she exposed a potentially devastating hole in the framework of Facebook's  third-party   application programming interface  (API). It made it easier for people to lose their privacy. Felt and her co-researchers found that third-party platform applications on Facebook are provided with far more user information than it is needed. This potential privacy breach is actually built into the systematic framework of Facebook. Unfortunately, the flaws render the system to be almost indefensible. "The question for social networks is resolving the difference between mistakes in implementation and what the design of the application platform is intended to allow," said David Evans, Assistant Professor of  Computer Science  at  the University of Virginia . Moreover, there is also the question of who should be held responsible for the lack of user privacy? According to Evan, the answer to the question is not likely to be found, because a better regulated API would be required for Facebook "to break a lot of applications, [especially when] a lot of companies are trying to make money off [these] applications." Felt agrees with her conclusion, because "there are marketing businesses built on top of the idea that third parties can get access to data and user information on Facebook."

In his speech, delivered to the  Internet Society 's New York Chapter, "Freedom in the Cloud", Moglen described  centralized social networks  as "spying for free." In a  New York Times  interview, Salzberg said "When you give up that data, you’re giving it up forever ... The value they give us is negligible in the scale of what they are doing, and what we are giving up is all of our privacy." Sofaer said, "We don't need to hand our messages to a hub. What Facebook gives you as a user isn't all that hard to do. All the little games, the little walls, the little chat, aren't really rare things. The technology already exists". However, Salzberg has said that "Facebook is not what we are going after".
91_7	CAR_75c414321bcd116debde9985a0859b0656387186	Social networking  currently provides more information and features than original function of allowing individuals to connect with their peers. Social networking sites have a large amount of data and records from billions of people, and construct recommendations used by enterprises, small business, and individuals. "Facebook has its own recommendation system in place. The service allows its 500 million members to click a button to indicate what news articles, companies and celebrities they 'like', and it shares data about those preferences with its Web partners. When a Facebook user visits a Web site like Yelp or TripAdvisor, they are shown reviews from friends before they get to those from strangers." Companies also use social networking to investigate candidates and employees. The results obtained from a potential employee's immediate social network are often more relevant, significant, and factual than what the candidate presents about themselves during an interview. Therefore, it is necessary to manage how you want to be perceived on your social network. There are several ways that perception management can help.
91_7	CAR_7bcaa2acda7432cd507ff4f10f178db4af816954	The study also offers the perspective that most users do not realize that restricting access to their data does not sufficiently address the risks resulting from the amount, quality and persistence of data they provide. Facebook users in our study report familiarity and use of privacy settings, they are still accepting people as "friends" that they have only heard of through other or do not know at all and, therefore, most have very large groups of "friends" that have access to widely uploaded information such as full names, birthdates, hometowns, and many pictures.  This study suggests that social network privacy does not merely exist within the realm of privacy settings, but privacy control is much within the hands of the user. Commentators have noted that online social networking poses a fundamental challenge to the theory of privacy as control. The stakes have been raised because digital technologies lack "the relative transience of human memory," and can be trolled or data mined for information. For users who are unaware of all privacy concerns and issues, further education on the safety of disclosing certain types of information on Facebook is highly recommended.
91_7	CAR_7bf8e5ba0ede41788e45496b46b21abc6632b0a7	Social networking  sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms. These website's leaders believe this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences.  On-line bullies  may make use of personal information to harass or  stalk  users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners. Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential  facial recognition technology , it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Because of image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.
91_7	CAR_87bb2cd8ca22dab4d528a85844a0e3a184d077d7	Another privacy issue with social networks is the privacy agreement. The privacy agreement states that the social network owns all of the content that users upload. This includes pictures, videos, and messages are all stored in the social networks database even if the user decides to terminate his or her account.
91_7	CAR_88a88531da86a3ec399a1867a66d02c87afdbee2	According to writer Christine Rosen in "Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism," many social media sites encourage status-seeking. According to Rosen, the practice and definition of "friendship" changes in virtuality. Friendship "in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron." Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who "recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'"Critic Nicholas G. Carr in "Is Google Making Us Stupid?" questions how technology affects  cognition  and  memory . "The kind of deep reading that a sequence of printed pages promotes is valuable not just for the knowledge we acquire from the author's words but for the intellectual vibrations those words set off within our own minds. In the quiet spaces opened up by the sustained, undistracted reading of a book, or by any other act of contemplation, for that matter, we make our own associations, draw our own inferences and analogies, foster our own ideas... If we lose those quiet spaces, or fill them up with "content," we will sacrifice something important not only in our selves but in our culture."
91_7	CAR_8cbdbf235687fd9fae5a1e61d8ed4c27ad9f0405	People with only a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total  anonymity . Internet users may protect their privacy through controlled disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve Internet anonymity to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, people need to be careful with what they submit to and look at online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, companies are now sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.
91_7	CAR_8dc3c361cec5fc6f5993e2dc1bf4856986b0fc52	Many social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships. Most of these social networks, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons. This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, but at the same time people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.
91_7	CAR_9c029e0b3ef2bd108aab8002d8b3cd4058ebae8d	Online social networks like  Facebook  and  MySpace  allow people to maintain an online identity with some overlap between online and real world context. These identities are often created to reflect a specific aspect or ideal version of themselves. Representations include pictures, communications with other 'friends' and membership in network groups. Privacy control settings on social networks are also part of social networking identity.

91_7	CAR_e740ce266a9f698fdcd4f19267722f513a6c1296	In addition, social media platforms have become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their viewers to connect with them in various ways.  Social-networking website Facebook Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves.  This may be an unethical or ethical feature to some individuals.  Some people may react negatively because they believe it is an invasion of privacy.  On the other hand, some individuals may enjoy this feature because their social network recognizes their interests and sends them particular advertisements pertaining to those interests.  Consumers like to network with people who have interests and desires that are similar to their own.  Individuals who agree to have their social media profile public, should be aware that advertisers have the ability to take information that interests them to be able to send them information and advertisements to boost their sales.  Managers invest in social media to foster relationships and interact with customers.  This is an ethical way for managers to send messages about their advertisements and products to their consumers.

This syndrome occurs through a user's repetitive and obsessive status-checking of "friend" status updates and posts related to social events or celebrations resulting in a feeling of being "left out".  There is a converse, polar-opposite reaction called "fear of being missed" (FOBM),  which involves an obsessive need to provide constant status updates on one's own personal, day-to-day life, movements, travel, events, etc. unable to "un-plug".

Results from a survey of university undergraduates showed that almost 10% met criteria for what investigators describe as "disordered social networking use." Respondents who met criteria for "Facebook addiction" also reported statistically significant symptoms commonly linked to addiction, such as tolerance (increased Facebook use over time), withdrawal (irritability when unable to access Facebook), and cravings to access the site, she added. "Our findings suggest that there may be shared mechanisms underlying both substance and behavioral addictions," Hormes added.
91_8	CAR_5005ce11ee3478032bfc3b7b29591c6d3e0d081f	A cyber-relationship addiction has been described as the addiction to social networking in all forms.  Social networking  such as  Facebook , and  online dating service s along with many other communication platforms create a place to communicate with new people. Virtual online friends start to gain more communication and importance over time to the person becoming more important than real-life family and friends.

Based upon research for brain development, there is a conclusion stating that daily exposure to high technology stimulates brain alternation and neurotransmitter release; ultimately strengthening new pathways in the brain. The human mind is now learning to access and process information more rapidly and shift attention quickly from one task to the next. All this access and vast selection is causing some entertainment seeker’s brains to develop the constant need for instant gratification with a loss of patience.To narrow down the connection between ADD and the Internet, Ju-Yu Yen at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan discovered that being easily bored rather than easily distracted is the core symptom of inattentive ADHD. Internet activities are based highly upon their interactivity levels and immediate response rates; these quick actions relive the feeling of boredom and possibly create a physical addiction. The Internet becomes the cure for those who cannot hold focus. Once again, research concludes that male college students are more likely to be screened positively for adult ADHD; however, the overall association between Internet addiction and attention deficit is more significant in females. The fast-paced lifestyle created by the Internet affects the way the human brain processes and receives information. Humans are now more anxious and their attention span is weakened by the over stimulation from technology. One theory is that web addicts have underlying depression, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
91_8	CAR_a78a2f41b72eda46b9b17eee5420eca6232cdb55	Social network addiction is a dependence of people by connection, updating and control of their and their friends social network page. The correlation between the social network use and a decreasing of offline social relationships is a complex issue, depending not only from the time spent on them but also from the motivation in using them. For some people in fact, the only important thing is to have a lot of friends in the network regardless if they are offline or only virtual; this is particularly true for teenagers as a reinforcement of egos. Sometimes teenagers use social networks to show their idealized image to the others. They generally start using social networks to improve face-to-face relationships. However, some of them use these tools as a showcase creating an idealized image to be accepted by groups and to reach a big number of friends. They spend a reduced time for face-to-face relationships, passing instead at least six hours per day on social networks. However, other studies claim that people are using social networks to communicate their real personality and not to promote their idealized identity.
91_8	CAR_b4c8ea0138c23ad28173c920208dbded77da5379	It is clear that, whilst still debated, the potential for internet or digital devices to have addictive qualities is an emerging concern.  In recent years particular attention has been paid to how the over-use of technology may be affecting the younger generation.  With an influx of technology designed for day-to-day use, many children are becoming increasingly reliant upon digital devices for education, social networking and entertainment.  With young people spending less time interacting with their peers face to face and more time indoors than previous generations, the direct impact of digital devices on both physical and mental well-being is becoming of concern.  In December 2013 researchers from the University of Maryland concluded the majority of students studied to be “addicted” to their technological devices, likening their symptoms when forcibly separated from technology to those experienced when withdrawn from an addictive substance.  The potential developmental side-effects of internet use are also recognised by the American Academy of Paediatrics in children under two years of age.  Furthermore, South Korea’s concern for the attachment its younger generation has to technology is even greater, with their parliament considering passing a law to curb obsessive game use within the country by classifying online gaming as a potentially anti-social addiction.

In his research paper he describes how social networks allow people to draw on their "mirror image." This causes a disturbing psychological effect, which can confuse people on their true identities. De Castro also discusses how time-consuming social networks can become for the common student. He also discusses the anxiety that constantly checking your phone can bring to the average human, and suggests that social networks are more addictive than drugs and can have a severe psychological impact in the long run of constant Internet use. He believes people go through phases and being a social network junkie is a common phase people eventually will find themselves out of. He states "It can take years to break through the social network addiction."

This addiction has become more prevalent in younger generations as computer technologies advance. When people suffer from internet addiction they are unable to control their use of the Internet. This can lead to psychological, social, school and work difficulties. Those addicted to the internet may be drawn to  social networking  sites,  online games  or other sites. Symptoms of this addiction include the following:  mood changes , excessive time spent online, perceived social control while online, and withdrawal when away from the computer.

91_8	CAR_e8bada7e533bea72c6587667388bd463a5d20e0a	A conceptual model of PIU has been developed based on primary data collected from addiction researchers, psychologists, and health providers as well as older adolescents themselves.  That study identified seven concepts, or clusters, that make up PIU using a  concept mapping  approach.  These seven clusters are: psychosocial risk factors; physical impairment; emotional impairment; social and functional impairment; risky Internet use; impulsive Internet use; and Internet use dependence. The last three constructs have not been previously identified. Risky Internet use are behaviors that increase risks of adverse consequences. It is not just the amount of time spent on the Internet that puts an adolescent at risk; how the time is spent is also an important consideration.  The impulsive use construct describes an inability to maintain balance or control of internet use in relation to everyday life. Finally, the dependent use construct reflects the more severe symptoms that are typically associated with addictions, such as withdrawal symptoms.  Thus, internet addiction may represent a severe form of PIU.

92_1	CAR_9c3b388756e8445171729701e652cf8e394f32ed	In the  2006–07 season , Wade missed a total of 31 games due to injury. He was elected to his third straight All-Star Game and received  All-NBA  honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing at least 31 games in a season since  Pete Maravich  of the  Utah Jazz  earned Second Team honors during the  1977–78 season . Despite Wade's play, the Heat struggled early in the season with injuries and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007. But with Shaquille O'Neal healthy and  Pat Riley  returning to the bench after undergoing hip and knee surgeries respectively, the Heat seemed poised to surge into the second half of the season. However, during a game against the  Houston Rockets  on February 21, 2007, while attempting to steal the ball from  Shane Battier , Wade dislocated his left shoulder and was assisted off the court in a wheelchair. After the injury, he was left with the decision to either  rehabilitate  the shoulder or undergo season-ending surgery. Wade later announced that he would put off the surgery and rehabilitate his shoulder with the intention of rejoining the team in time for the playoffs. After missing 23 games to recover from the injury, Wade returned to the active roster in a game against the  Charlotte Bobcats . Sporting a black sleeve to help protect his dislocated left shoulder, Wade played 27 minutes and recorded 12 points and 8 assists, in an 111–103 overtime loss. For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals per game shooting 50% from the field, and finished the season as the NBA's leader in PER (Player efficiency rating).

The exercise requires bending at hips and bringing torso forward. For this exercise, the back must be kept straight while holding the barbell with a wide overhand grip and bending the knees slightly. The first movement is bringing the bar up towards chest; this movement is retraction of the scapulae 
92_2	CAR_167ebcb32db9c78056ead3089ef5697233db723b	Patients that suffer from pain in the rotator cuff may consider utilizing  orthotherapy  into their daily lives. Orthotherapy is an exercise program that aims to restore the motion and strength of the shoulder muscles. Patients can go through the three phases of orthotherapy to help manage pain and also recover their full range of motion in the rotator cuff. The first phase involves gentle stretches and passive all around movements, and people are advised not to go above 70 degrees of elevation to prevent any kind of further pain. The second phase of this regimen requires patients to implement exercises to strengthen the muscles that are surrounding the rotator cuff muscles, combined with the passive exercises done in the first phase to keep on stretching the tissues without overexerting them. Exercises include  pushups  and shoulder shrugs, and after a couple of weeks of this, daily activities are gradually added to the patient’s routine. This program does not require any sort of medication or surgery and can serve as a good alternative.The rotator cuff and the upper muscles are responsible for many daily tasks that people do in their lives. A proper recovery needs to be maintained and achieved to prevent limiting movement, and can be done through simple movements.
92_2	CAR_1ccb3c6ddf172eb27b8e7eea11c44d3a22d4c895	After experiencing a rotator cuff tear, minimally invasive surgery is needed in order to repair the torn tendon. After surgery, the rehabilitation of the rotator cuff is necessary in order to regain maximum strength and range of motion within the shoulder joint.  Physical therapy  progresses through four stages, increasing movement throughout each phase. The tempo and intensity of the stages are solely reliant on the extent of the injury and the patient’s activity necessities. The first stage requires  immobilization  of the  shoulder joint . The shoulder that is injured is placed in a sling and shoulder flexion or abduction of the arm is avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery (Brewster, 1993). Avoiding movement of the shoulder joint allows the torn tendon to fully heal. Once the  tendon  is entirely recovered, passive exercises can be implemented. Passive exercises of the shoulder are movements in which a physical therapist maintains the arm in a particular position, manipulating the rotator cuff without any effort by the patient. These exercises are used to increase stability, strength and range of motion of the  Subscapularis ,  Supraspinatus ,  Infraspinatus , and  Teres minor  muscles within the rotator cuff. Passive exercises include internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, as well as flexion and extension of the shoulder.
92_2	CAR_2ee1e95fcaaed38563aab9d9add86ea511072a04	Shoulder Girdle strengthening is a preventative procedure to help minimize tissue damage or other injuries while completing complex progressions in sports.  Strengthening of the shoulder area can done by exercising specific muscle groups which are as follow.  The positioners of the shoulder are the rotator cuff muscles:  supraspinatus ,  infraspinatus ,  teres minor , and  subscapularis . Propellers are major movers to create force with the arms, which include larger muscles: pectoralis major/minor,  latissimus dorsi , and  trapezius . The stabilizers of the shoulder are the  deltoid  group. Several other muscles should not be forgotten that assist with control of scapula thoracic rhythm:  rhomboid muscles , serratus posteriors,  levator scapulae muscle , and others smaller muscles.  A key way to prevent shoulder injury is making sure to do slow and in control stretches and exercises in proper form with proper progression.  In any sporting activity proper progression should include strengthening below 90 degrees, then progressing into a 90 degree range, and then full overhead exercises.  Specific progression exercises should target rotator cuff muscles and other muscles that attach to the shoulder girdle. Many individuals at gyms are injured because of incorrect equipment use.  An experienced professional should assist with program development, progression, and implementation in injury prevention such as a certified personal trainer.  If a minor shoulder injury does occur and isn’t severe, these measures can be taken to activate and recuperate the muscles: light stretching, light weightlifting, warm or cold packs as needed, and therapeutic message. Each sport has a different shoulder movement mechanics, and when executed correctly it will put less strain on the shoulder which in-turn preserves the shoulder longer.
92_2	CAR_32ce54333e42e7c63e37648ad99d388818c76036	Physical therapy   (PT) can help improve muscle strength & coordination, mobility (such as standing and walking), and other physical function using different sensorimotor techniques.  Physiotherapists can also help reduce shoulder pain by maintaining shoulder range of motion, as well as using  Functional electrical stimulation .  Supportive devices, such as braces or slings, can be used to help prevent or treat shoulder subluxation in the hopes to minimize disability and pain.  It should be noted that although many individuals suffering from stroke experience both shoulder pain and shoulder subluxation, the two are mutually exclusive. A treatment method that can be implemented with the goal of helping to regain motor function in the affected limb is  constraint-induced movement therapy . This consists of constraining the unaffected limb, forcing the affected limb to accomplish tasks of daily living.
92_2	CAR_414dab90f9eb8ddaaf1ea0b0c1de3b9fb863c4d9	One article observed the influence of  stretching  techniques on preventative methods of shoulder injuries.  Increased  velocity  of exercise increases injury, but beginning a fast-movement exercise with a slow stretch may cause muscle/tendon attachment to become more resistant to tearing.
92_2	CAR_52060ff7e742ddce731f499a4d7e55fb60df4f1f	To counteract shoulder and elbow injury, coaches and trainers have begun utilizing "jobe" exercises, named for Dr.  Frank Jobe , the pioneer of the Tommy John procedure. Jobes are exercises that have been developed to isolate, strengthen and stabilize the rotator cuff muscles. Jobes can be done using either resistance bands or lightweight dumbbells.  Common jobe exercises include shoulder external rotation, shoulder flexion, horizontal abduction, prone abduction and scaption (at 45°, 90° and inverse 45°).

92_2	CAR_99b852e44c545bda641c4c12a6497ea5844505f6	After about four weeks range of motion exercises can be started. Passive exercises are done which the shoulder joint is moved but the muscles stay relaxed. After about six to eight weeks active therapy is started. Such exercises can include isometric strengthening which works the muscles without straining the healing of the joint. After about three months, more active strengthening will be incorporated which focus on improving the strength and control of the rotator cuff muscles and the muscles around the shoulder blade. The exercises that the therapist gives the patient to be done at home should be done to be able to get a better recovery in the long run.
92_2	CAR_b333967bebc5840a4f7cf6ae28d74b22de940090	Therapeutic exercises are frequently used in combination with many of the previously mentioned  modalities  and with great results. A variety of exercise regimens are available in patient treatment. An exercise regimen should be modified according to the abilities and weaknesses of the patient. Stabilization of the  cervicothoracic  region is helpful in limiting pain and preventing re-injury, through physical therapy. Cervical and lumbar support braces typically are not indicated for radiculopathy, and may lead to weakness of support musculature. The first part of the stabilization procedure is achieving a pain free full range of motion which can be accomplished through stretching exercises. Subsequently a strengthening exercise program should be designed to restore the deconditioned  cervical ,  shoulder girdle , and  upper trunk  musculature. As reliance on the neck brace diminishes, an  isometric exercise  regimen should be introduced. This is a preferred method of exercise during the sub-acute phase because it resists  atrophy  and is least likely to exacerbate the condition. Single plane resistance exercises against cervical flexion, extension, bending, and rotation are used.
92_2	CAR_c06eacc34af29314995392a00af64b44a5af8501	Physical therapy is important when dealing with a brachial plexus injuries. One of the main goals of rehabilitation is to prevent muscle atrophy until the nerves regain function.  Electrical stimulation  is an effective treatment to help patients reach this fundamental goal. Exercises that involve shoulder extension, flexion, elevation, depression, abduction and adduction facilitate healing by engaging the nerves in the damaged sites as well as improve muscle function.  Stretching  is done on a daily basis to improve or maintain range of motion. Stretching is important in order to rehabilitate since it increases the blood flow to the injury as well as facilitates nerves in functioning properly.
92_2	CAR_ecf0b95b4c67926bc4eb464f8b628a91cdd796d3	Physiotherapy  can help manage the pain, but utilizing a program that involves continuous passive motion will reduce the pain even further.  Assisted passive motion  at a low intensity allows the tissues to be stretched slightly without damaging them   Continuous passive motion  improves the shoulder range and enables the subject to expand their range of motion without experiencing additional pain. Easing into the motions will allow the person to continue working those muscles to keep them from undergoing atrophy, while also still maintaining that minimum level of function where daily function is allowed. Doing these exercises will also prevent tears in the muscles that will impair daily function further. Since injuries of the rotator cuff often tend to inhibit motion without first experience discomfort and pain, other methods can be done to help accommodate that.
92_2	CAR_f41a84f9bb8d4c827a612fe06164be0cdec89c86	Some physical therapy exercises that can be performed to help rehab the shoulder are:While standing and using a theraband you can perform Y, T, and I’s,  Internal shoulder rotation,  External shoulder rotation,  Shoulder extensions,and Scapula squeezes While lying on your side you can perform internal rotation and external rotation with a light weight. The light weight can be any type of object such as a 1-5 lb dumbbell weight, or a soup can. Also you can foam roll the pectorals. With the foam roller you can also lie on your back on top of it and do snow angels.  
92_2	CAR_f6a260122dbf9242957e34c19a14e2fd044d2be9		Conditioning of the shoulder area involves full body exercises through a full range of motion. Exercises that are light to moderate activity over a 30-60 minute time period should increase  cardiac output , which in-turn helps carry more oxygen saturated blood throughout the body. Regular running or an upper body ergometer are examples of full body exercise to increase cardiovascular endurance for proper conditioning. The more blood that the heart can pump throughout the body helps endurance performance by supplying the body with more nutrients and oxygen for a prolonged period of time. In addition to conditioning the heart; a good dynamic warm-up, particular to a sport, should be in place to help prevent shoulder injury.  Dynamic warm ups for upper and lower body can be considered a form of conditioning.  The athlete can stretch and perform small movements in multiple directions to increase neurovascular response which satisfies dynamic warm ups. The increase in blood flow and neurological feedback will help with physiological and mechanical components for sport performance. This also helps with the exchange of oxygen from the blood to the tissues and synapses of the neurons happening quicker which leads to enhanced performance.
92_2	MARCO_2576386	The barbell upright row is an exercise that targets several muscles of the shoulder. It is a compound exercise, meaning it uses multiple joints, and must be done with proper form to prevent injury. For some people with shoulder pain or problems, the exercise may be contraindicated.
92_2	MARCO_2641437	Mobility exercises. Rotator cuff exercises to improve shoulder mobility should begin as soon as pain allows. The aim is to restore full, pain free mobility to the shoulder joint. In some patients mobility could already be good depending on how bad their injury is and therefore less time should be spent on these exercises before moving on.

92_2	MARCO_3696585	Shoulder range-of-motion exercises often begin 4 weeks after surgery. You will use your opposite arm to help move your injured arm until it is strong enough to move on its own. Strengthening exercises may begin once you have regained full motion in your injured shoulder, usually 4 to 6 weeks after your surgery. However, overhead exercises and heavy lifting place more stress on your healing tendon and may be delayed until 10 to 12 weeks after surgery.
92_2	MARCO_3766594	Recovery from rotator cuff surgery is a lengthy process. Surgery on the shoulder to repair a rotator cuff tear usually produces significant pain and stiffness. Recovery from rotator cuff surgery is slow. This is because of the time it takes for the repaired rotator cuff tendon to heal back to the bone.
92_2	MARCO_3890472	Shoulder Adduction Exercises. Strengthening the adduction muscles provides stability to the shoulder joint. While you may not give it much thought, the muscles that bring your arm in towards your body are actually quite important.

92_2	MARCO_5757626	More Shoulder Rehabilitation Information. Clavicle Fracture Rehab Exercise Program: The pendulum exercise is one of the standard daily exercises often recommended in rehab for a clavicle fracture (broken collarbone). This is a common sports injury that often happens in a fall by a cyclist or in other activities.
92_2	MARCO_5757627	Because it is so mobile, the shoulder is also vulnerable to injury. When injured, Codman pendulum exercises may be recommended by a health care professional as part of therapy to relax the muscles in your shoulder, relieve pain and increase range of motion.
92_2	MARCO_5757628	Updated April 18, 2016. Pendulum circles are common shoulder exercises used early in physical therapy rehab for shoulder injuries. This simple exercise helps regain range of motion in the shoulder joint and the muscles that make up the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles that are often injured due to overuse and traumatic shoulder injuries, such as a fractured clavicle (collarbone).
92_2	MARCO_667509	Wrap an ice pack in a thin towel and apply to the affected area for fifteen minutes three to four times a day. 3. Wear a brace. Tennis elbow braces help to protect the damaged tendon during the healing process. However, be sure to wear it just below the painful area of the arm, not directly over it. 4. Perform tennis elbow exercises. These are special stretches that help to encourage healing. However, do not do any of these exercises if you still experience a lot of pain, as you could worsen the situation.
92_2	MARCO_6757881	Shoulder Shrugs This will strengthen the top of your shoulders and upper back and can be fit in between other arm and shoulder exercises for a quick transition. Incline Rear Deltoid Fly This challenges your balance with a split leg stance while strengthening the rear shoulders and lower back.
92_2	MARCO_6842041	Theraband Strengthening for the shoulder. These resistance exercises should be done very slowly in both directions. The goal is to achieve a. maximum amount of strengthening while listening to your end-point of pain. Work within a pain. free range of motion at all times and do the exercises very slowly.
92_2	MARCO_6842047	If you want this exercise to really work your shoulder muscles you should make sure to be pushing yourself as far off the ground as possible. Do a bridge exercise (with an exercise ball). Just like a regular bridge exercise, this will build up strength in your arm, leg, and back muscles as well as your shoulders.
92_2	MARCO_7435760	For exercises that would suit this injury, I would suggest any triceps workout that does not move the shoulder such as triceps cable pulldowns and dumbbell kickbacks. For reference, I am a massage therapist and personal fitness trainer of 2 years.

92_3	CAR_167ebcb32db9c78056ead3089ef5697233db723b	Patients that suffer from pain in the rotator cuff may consider utilizing  orthotherapy  into their daily lives. Orthotherapy is an exercise program that aims to restore the motion and strength of the shoulder muscles. Patients can go through the three phases of orthotherapy to help manage pain and also recover their full range of motion in the rotator cuff. The first phase involves gentle stretches and passive all around movements, and people are advised not to go above 70 degrees of elevation to prevent any kind of further pain. The second phase of this regimen requires patients to implement exercises to strengthen the muscles that are surrounding the rotator cuff muscles, combined with the passive exercises done in the first phase to keep on stretching the tissues without overexerting them. Exercises include  pushups  and shoulder shrugs, and after a couple of weeks of this, daily activities are gradually added to the patient’s routine. This program does not require any sort of medication or surgery and can serve as a good alternative.The rotator cuff and the upper muscles are responsible for many daily tasks that people do in their lives. A proper recovery needs to be maintained and achieved to prevent limiting movement, and can be done through simple movements.
92_3	CAR_1ccb3c6ddf172eb27b8e7eea11c44d3a22d4c895	After experiencing a rotator cuff tear, minimally invasive surgery is needed in order to repair the torn tendon. After surgery, the rehabilitation of the rotator cuff is necessary in order to regain maximum strength and range of motion within the shoulder joint.  Physical therapy  progresses through four stages, increasing movement throughout each phase. The tempo and intensity of the stages are solely reliant on the extent of the injury and the patient’s activity necessities. The first stage requires  immobilization  of the  shoulder joint . The shoulder that is injured is placed in a sling and shoulder flexion or abduction of the arm is avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery (Brewster, 1993). Avoiding movement of the shoulder joint allows the torn tendon to fully heal. Once the  tendon  is entirely recovered, passive exercises can be implemented. Passive exercises of the shoulder are movements in which a physical therapist maintains the arm in a particular position, manipulating the rotator cuff without any effort by the patient. These exercises are used to increase stability, strength and range of motion of the  Subscapularis ,  Supraspinatus ,  Infraspinatus , and  Teres minor  muscles within the rotator cuff. Passive exercises include internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, as well as flexion and extension of the shoulder.
92_3	CAR_2ee1e95fcaaed38563aab9d9add86ea511072a04	Shoulder Girdle strengthening is a preventative procedure to help minimize tissue damage or other injuries while completing complex progressions in sports.  Strengthening of the shoulder area can done by exercising specific muscle groups which are as follow.  The positioners of the shoulder are the rotator cuff muscles:  supraspinatus ,  infraspinatus ,  teres minor , and  subscapularis . Propellers are major movers to create force with the arms, which include larger muscles: pectoralis major/minor,  latissimus dorsi , and  trapezius . The stabilizers of the shoulder are the  deltoid  group. Several other muscles should not be forgotten that assist with control of scapula thoracic rhythm:  rhomboid muscles , serratus posteriors,  levator scapulae muscle , and others smaller muscles.  A key way to prevent shoulder injury is making sure to do slow and in control stretches and exercises in proper form with proper progression.  In any sporting activity proper progression should include strengthening below 90 degrees, then progressing into a 90 degree range, and then full overhead exercises.  Specific progression exercises should target rotator cuff muscles and other muscles that attach to the shoulder girdle. Many individuals at gyms are injured because of incorrect equipment use.  An experienced professional should assist with program development, progression, and implementation in injury prevention such as a certified personal trainer.  If a minor shoulder injury does occur and isn’t severe, these measures can be taken to activate and recuperate the muscles: light stretching, light weightlifting, warm or cold packs as needed, and therapeutic message. Each sport has a different shoulder movement mechanics, and when executed correctly it will put less strain on the shoulder which in-turn preserves the shoulder longer.
92_3	CAR_32ce54333e42e7c63e37648ad99d388818c76036	Physical therapy   (PT) can help improve muscle strength & coordination, mobility (such as standing and walking), and other physical function using different sensorimotor techniques.  Physiotherapists can also help reduce shoulder pain by maintaining shoulder range of motion, as well as using  Functional electrical stimulation .  Supportive devices, such as braces or slings, can be used to help prevent or treat shoulder subluxation in the hopes to minimize disability and pain.  It should be noted that although many individuals suffering from stroke experience both shoulder pain and shoulder subluxation, the two are mutually exclusive. A treatment method that can be implemented with the goal of helping to regain motor function in the affected limb is  constraint-induced movement therapy . This consists of constraining the unaffected limb, forcing the affected limb to accomplish tasks of daily living.
92_3	CAR_52060ff7e742ddce731f499a4d7e55fb60df4f1f	To counteract shoulder and elbow injury, coaches and trainers have begun utilizing "jobe" exercises, named for Dr.  Frank Jobe , the pioneer of the Tommy John procedure. Jobes are exercises that have been developed to isolate, strengthen and stabilize the rotator cuff muscles. Jobes can be done using either resistance bands or lightweight dumbbells.  Common jobe exercises include shoulder external rotation, shoulder flexion, horizontal abduction, prone abduction and scaption (at 45°, 90° and inverse 45°).
92_3	CAR_7a86bd8f801bb42227469bbfaf8faf8ea469dea4		Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis,  volleyball , baseball, swimming, etc.  According to Bahr’s major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures.  Damage to the shoulder and adjacent features can fluctuate in severity depending on the person’s age, sport, position, recurring shoulder dysfunction, and many other factors.  Some other common shoulder injuries are fractures to any shoulder girdle bones i.e.  clavicle , ligamentous sprains such as  AC joint  or GH ligaments, rotator cuff injuries, different labral tears, and other acute or chronic conditions related to shoulder anatomy. In order to help limit or decrease the severity of an injury, proper maintenance and conditioning should take place. Proper warm ups, strengthening of the shoulder complex, and lifestyle choices can help bring positive lifelong use of the shoulders.
92_3	CAR_e255bf7fd2bf3ba23fffaf188b47e033b8a7b116	As progression increases after 4–6 weeks,active exercises are now implemented into the rehabilitation process. Active exercises allow an increase in strength and further range of motion by permitting the movement of the shoulder joint without the support of a physical therapist. Active exercises include the Pendulum exercise (as shown in Image 2), which is used to strengthen the Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, and Subscapularis. External rotation of the shoulder with the arm at a 90-degree angle is an additional exercise done to increase control and range of motion of the Infraspinatus and Teres minor muscles. Various active exercises are done for an additional 3–6 weeks as progress is based on an individual case by case basis. At 8–12 weeks,  strength training  intensity will increase as free-weights and resistance bands will be implemented within the exercise prescription.
92_3	CAR_f41a84f9bb8d4c827a612fe06164be0cdec89c86	Some physical therapy exercises that can be performed to help rehab the shoulder are:While standing and using a theraband you can perform Y, T, and I’s,  Internal shoulder rotation,  External shoulder rotation,  Shoulder extensions,and Scapula squeezes While lying on your side you can perform internal rotation and external rotation with a light weight. The light weight can be any type of object such as a 1-5 lb dumbbell weight, or a soup can. Also you can foam roll the pectorals. With the foam roller you can also lie on your back on top of it and do snow angels.

92_3	MARCO_8137250	ANATOMY AND FUNCTION. The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint that connects. the bone of the upper arm (humerus) with the shoulder. blade (scapula). The capsule is a broad ligament that. surrounds and stabilizes the joint. The shoulder joint is. moved and also stabilized by the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is comprised of four muscles and their tendons that attach from the scapula to the humerus. The rotator cuff tendons (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis) are just outside the shoulder joint and its capsule. The muscles of the rotator cuff help stabilize the shoulder and enable you to lift your arm, reach overhead, and take part in activities such as throwing, swimming and tennis. ROTATOR CUFF INJURY AND TREATMENT OPTIONS The rotator cuff can tear as an acute injury such as when lifting a heavy weight or falling on the shoulder or elbow. The shoulder is immediately weak and there is pain when trying to lift the arm. A torn rotator cuff due to an injury is usually best treated by immediate surgical repair. The rotator cuff can also wear out as a result of degenerative changes. This type of rotator cuff tear can usually be repaired but sometimes the tear

92_3	MARCO_8592744	Arm Exercises. The only limit to the number of arm exercises you can do at your desk is your stamina and imagination. Do arm and shoulder circles in both directions to work arm and shoulder muscles. Punch the air above your head, to your sides, in front of you and by your knees to work all of your arm muscles. Hold your arms out from your sides and bend your elbows so your hands touch your ears to work your biceps.
92_3	MARCO_8692073	When you do target your chest, use push-ups. Exercises like the bench press lock your shoulder blades in place as you push, which is not how the area should function. Push-ups, however, let the scapula move freely, which improves shoulder health. They also strengthen shoulder-stabilizing muscles like the serratus anterior, which is often weak and inactive.

Surgery is considered if pain worsens.  There are two primary methods for shoulder replacement; total shoulder replacement and reverse shoulder replacement.  Total shoulder replacement involves a replacement of the ball and socket joint.  A metal ball is used to replace the humeral head and a plastic socket replaces the cartilage on the glenoid cavity.  Once complete this method looks and functions like the original joint.

Some suggest that surgical exploration should be considered if no recovery occurs after 3 to 6 months. Some surgical options include nerve grafting, neurolysis, or nerve reconstruction. Surgery results are typically better for younger patients (under 25) and for nerve grafts less than six centimeters. 
92_5	CAR_bb4782dc4b262914fa31ac1011097d828950a393	Shoulder replacement surgery is an option for treatment of severe arthritis of the shoulder joint. Arthritis is a condition that affects the cartilage of the joints. As the cartilage lining wears away, the protective lining between the bones is lost. When this happens, painful bone-on-bone arthritis develops. Severe shoulder arthritis is quite painful, and can cause restriction of motion. While this may be tolerated with some medications and lifestyle adjustments, there may come a time when surgical treatment is necessary.
92_5	CAR_bd30d85e08f8e11ce60480afc340fe7555649ac9	When exercise and medication are no longer effective, shoulder replacement surgery for arthritis may be considered.  In this operation, a surgeon replaces the shoulder joint with an artificial ball for the top of the humerus and a cap (glenoid) for the scapula. Passive shoulder exercises (where someone else moves the arm to rotate the shoulder joint) are started soon after surgery. Patients begin exercising on their own about 3 to 6 weeks after surgery. Eventually, stretching and strengthening exercises become a major part of the rehabilitation programme. The success of the operation often depends on the condition of rotator cuff muscles prior to surgery and the degree to which the patient follows the exercise programme.
92_5	CAR_c3229677200cb31f10d5fe7cf11fe3be364a95ee	Type IV, V, and VI shoulder separations are very uncommon but always require surgery. There is some debate among orthopedic surgeons, however, about the treatment of type III shoulder separation. Many with type III shoulder separation who do not undergo surgical treatment recover just as well as those who do receive it, and avoid the added risks that surgery may present.  Those who opt out of surgery also have faster recovery times and are able to return to work or sports sooner.  Some studies suggest early surgical treatment of type III separation may benefit laborers and athletes who perform overhead motions.  The potential benefit of surgical treatment for type III remains unproven.  Studies have been done that those who did have the surgery or not will need some kind of operation later down the road. The injured joint degenerates a lot faster than normal and over time it can become arthritic and painful.

92_5	MARCO_53242	Surgery may be used to treat a torn rotator cuff if the injury is very severe or if nonsurgical treatment has failed to improve shoulder strength and movement sufficiently. Surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff tendon usually involves: 1  Removing loose fragments of tendon, bursa, and other debris from the space in the shoulder where the rotator cuff moves (debridement). 2  Making more room for the rotator cuff tendon so it is not pinched or irritated.
92_5	MARCO_5601689	Doctors usually perform surgery soon after a bone fracture in the shoulder to reconstruct a healthy posture. Displaced bone fragments will be rearranged while the patient is anesthetized. The Cleveland Clinic notes that damaged joint or muscle tissue adjacent to the broken shoulder may also require surgical repair.octors or physical therapists will provide guidelines for rest and flexibility exercises. While a broken shoulder may take as long as 12 weeks to heal, according to the University of Buffalo Sports Medicine group, the advantage of this rest period is pain relief rather than additional bone stress.
92_5	MARCO_5601690	Most shoulder fractures heal in about six weeks. About 20 percent of shoulder fractures are displaced and may require some type of manipulation to restore normal anatomy. Occasionally the rotator cuff muscles are injured or torn at the same time as the fracture.This can further complicate the treatment.ome of the risks of surgery of shoulder replacement include infection, wound healing problems, bleeding and injury to nerves and vessels near the fracture. Sometimes the shoulder gets very stiff. Occasionally, the fracture does not heal, and another operation may be recommended.

92_6	CAR_0633dae064bba7017568f98ab629333f2e574f6d	Treatment of shoulder arthritis is usually aimed at reducing pain; there is no way to replace lost cartilage except through  surgery .   Pain medicine s available  over-the-counter  can be prescribed by the doctor, but another form of treatment is  cryotherapy , which is the use of  cold compression .  Some  vitamin supplements  have been found to prevent further deterioration;  glucosamine sulfate  is an effective preserver of cartilage.  Another way to prevent the further loss of cartilage would be to maintain motion in the shoulder, because once it is lost, it's difficult to regain.  Steps to reduce extreme pain in cases of bad shoulder arthritis can involve the doctor giving injections directly into the shoulder, or even shoulder surgery.

Movement exercises are begun within at least a week of the injury; with these, fractures with little or no displacement heal without problems. Over 90% of scapular fractures are not significantly displaced; therefore, most of these fractures are best managed without surgery.  Fractures of the scapular body with displacement may heal with malunion, but even this may not interfere with movement of the affected shoulder.  However, displaced fractures in the scapular processes or in the glenoid do interfere with movement in the affected shoulder if they are not realigned properly.  Therefore, while most scapular fractures are managed without surgery, surgical reduction is required for fractures in the neck or glenoid; otherwise motion of the shoulder may be impaired.
92_6	CAR_2dd912b5f18d01f4973ea2c781c7d2e3b0b495c8	There is consensus amongst orthopaedic surgeons and physical therapists regarding rotator cuff repair rehabilitation protocols. The timing and duration of treatments and exercises are based on biologic and biomedical factors involving the rotator cuff. For approximately two to three week following surgery, a patient experiences shoulder pain and swelling; no major therapeutic measures are instituted in this window other than oral pain medicine and ice.   All in all, those patients at risk of failure, should undergo a more conservative approach to rehabilitations.

Physiotherapists can also help reduce shoulder pain by maintaining shoulder range of motion, as well as using  Functional electrical stimulation .  Supportive devices, such as braces or slings, can be used to help prevent or treat shoulder subluxation in the hopes to minimize disability and pain.  It should be noted that although many individuals suffering from stroke experience both shoulder pain and shoulder subluxation, the two are mutually exclusive. A treatment method that can be implemented with the goal of helping to regain motor function in the affected limb is  constraint-induced movement therapy . This consists of constraining the unaffected limb, forcing the affected limb to accomplish tasks of daily living.

In some cases the physical therapist will use  ultrasound  and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle stretching and strengthening  exercise s are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the doctor may inject a  corticosteroid  medicine into the space under the acromion. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there is still no improvement after 6 to 12 months, the doctor may perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae.

Literature regarding long-term follow-up after surgical repair of type III injuries is scarce, and those treated nonoperatively generally do quite well. There may also be the potential that surgical repair may be less painful in the long run.
92_6	CAR_98a59771f1022728df6d247a1b6aa7ced98608e8	Treatment depends on a specific underlying cause. The underlying cause will be treated first and foremost. The treatments may include  joint replacement  surgery for severely damaged joints,  immunosuppressants  for immune system dysfunction, antibiotics when an infection is the cause, and discontinuing medication when an allergic reaction is the cause. When treating the primary cause, pain management may still play a role in treatment. The extent of its role varies depending on the specific cause of the arthralgia. Pain management may include stretching exercises, over the counter pain medications, prescription pain medication, or other treatments deemed appropriate for the symptoms. Capsaicin , a substance found in  chili pepper s, may relieve joint pain from arthritis and other conditions. Capsaicin blocks the actions of  substance P , which helps transmit pain signals, and capsaicin triggers the release of pain-blocking chemicals in the body known as  endorphin s. Side effects of capsaicin cream include burning or stinging in the area where it is applied. Another topical option is an arthritis cream containing the ingredient, methyl salicylate ( Bengay ).
92_6	CAR_aa53430af390016c38d1f15b84d07b419a36cd9f	Adhesive capsulitis or frozen shoulder syndrome is a common shoulder capsule pathology that results when injury, surgery, or other chronic health conditions such as  diabetes  and  arthritis  damage or loosen the  shoulder joint . As a result of the damage, the shoulder capsule becomes  inflamed  and taut, leading to stiffness, pain, and limited range of motion in the shoulder area. Range of motion can usually be restored by treating the affected area with heat and  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  in addition to light stretching and or a disciplined  physical therapy  program. In extreme cases where medication and physical therapy prove to be ineffective in treating the condition,  arthroscopic surgery  (known as Arthroscopic Capsular Release) can be performed to loosen the capsule by removing regions of thickened  scar tissue  within and around the shoulder joint.
92_6	CAR_aeeacb31adb7457ba752fec9f9d861396ad1fa07	Taping can also help relieve pain in the shoulder. According to the textbook “Essentials of athletic injury management” by prentice and Arnheim, Athletic tape helps to alleviate pain by increasing circulation to affected area, provide support, provides a means for stabilizing the arm, and allows for pressure reduction. When pain is cause from it being in a constant raise position. A technique where tape is applied to drop the shoulder can be used to get rid of the pain and strain by adding more space in the joint. For example, for the  acromioclavicular joint  taping can be applied to relieve pain in the top of the shoulder from a collision or as a result of the joint becoming separated because of damage to ligament. The way the shoulder is positioned can cause pain and retracting the shoulder by tapping can relieve the pain. See figure 3 for an illustration on shoulder tapping.
92_6	CAR_b333967bebc5840a4f7cf6ae28d74b22de940090	Therapeutic exercises are frequently used in combination with many of the previously mentioned  modalities  and with great results. A variety of exercise regimens are available in patient treatment. An exercise regimen should be modified according to the abilities and weaknesses of the patient. Stabilization of the  cervicothoracic  region is helpful in limiting pain and preventing re-injury, through physical therapy. Cervical and lumbar support braces typically are not indicated for radiculopathy, and may lead to weakness of support musculature. The first part of the stabilization procedure is achieving a pain free full range of motion which can be accomplished through stretching exercises. Subsequently a strengthening exercise program should be designed to restore the deconditioned  cervical ,  shoulder girdle , and  upper trunk  musculature. As reliance on the neck brace diminishes, an  isometric exercise  regimen should be introduced. This is a preferred method of exercise during the sub-acute phase because it resists  atrophy  and is least likely to exacerbate the condition. Single plane resistance exercises against cervical flexion, extension, bending, and rotation are used.

Smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in 1978. Under this new franchise agreement, new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large, multi-state corporations from owning franchises. Franchisee were also now prohibited from operating other chains, preventing them from diverting funds away from their Burger King holdings. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King Corporation as Chart House had. Smith also sought to have BKC be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. By 1988, parent company Pillsbury had relaxed many of Smith's changes, scaled back on the construction of new locations which resulted in stalled growth of the brand.

Early snowboarders sought out pristine snow conditions as a necessity.  The development of splitboards has simplified  backcountry snowboarding  where pristine powder snow is more likely to be found.  Splitboards address the inherent weakness of snowboards of having limited backcountry range away from lift systems.  This weakness stems from snowboard riders having both feet fixed to a board, so a standard snowboard can't climb up hills the way skiers can.

Poppen was inspired by watching his daughter attempt to sled down a hill standing up and so he decided to fashion his skis together and then tie rope to the nose for more stability. His wife named his creation the "Snurfer", a combination of snow and surfer, and between 1966 and 1977, Poppen sold over half a million all around the country. The snurfer was originally marketed to kids in grocery stores but when more traditional models were created, they were marketed to surfers and skateboarders. Despite the increasing popularity, snowboarding was seen as a gimmick and wasn't recognized as a true sport. More importantly, it was banned from all ski resorts in North America, forcing any prospective boarders to look elsewhere. Backcountry snowboarding became the original kind of snowboarding simply because there was no other choice, boards were specifically designed for powder snow and the experimental board designs weren't designed for groomers. It wasn't until the 1980s that snowboarders were finally accepted into resorts. Despite the new access to resorts and lifts, some boarders chose to continue to ride in the backcountry.

For many years, there was animosity between skiers and snowboarders, which led to an ongoing skier vs snowboarder feud. Early snowboards were banned from the slopes by park officials. In 1985, only seven percent of U.S. ski areas allowed snowboarding, with a similar proportion in Europe. Because of this, snowboarders sought ways to protest of such treatment from resorts owners and to a lesser degree, other skiers. Indeed, the snowboarding way of life came about to rebel against skiing. As a result, snowboarders chose to "shock" skiers by snowboarding in a ski-only resort as protest.

Randy believes that Sherman took an old water ski and made it into the snurfer for his children who were bored in the winter.  He added bindings to keep their boots secure. (Randy Lee October 14, 2014)  Commercially available Snurfers in the late 1960s and early 1970s had no bindings. The snowboarder held onto a looped nylon lanyard attached to the front of the Snurfer, and stood upon several rows of square U-shaped staples that were partially driven into the board but protruded about 1 cm above the board's surface to provide traction even when packed with snow. Later Snurfer models replaced the staples with ridged rubber grips running longitudinally along the length of the board (originally) or, subsequently, as subrectangular pads upon which the snowboarder would stand. It is widely accepted that  Jake Burton Carpenter  (founder of  Burton Snowboards ) and/or  Tom Sims  (founder of  Sims Snowboards ) invented modern snowboarding by introducing bindings and steel edges to snowboards.

It was developed in the United States in the 1960s and became a Winter Olympic Sport in 1998. Its popularity (as measured by equipment sales) peaked in 2007 and has been in a decline since.
94_1	MARCO_3174395	What year did snowboarding become popular? The year that is identified as when snowboarding became popular was  1985 when more people started practicing it. An international  magazine for snowboarding, which later beâ¦came International  Snowboarding Magazine, also helped it spread.
94_1	MARCO_409	Sherman Poppen attached two skis together in Muskegon, Mich., in 1965. His wife christened it the Snurfer and the kids loved it. He may have been inspired by a sled-like device made of plywood that first appeared in the 1920s. Poppen may have made the first snowboard; many say that he did. He certainly took a step in the evolution of snowboards. Dutch native Dimitrije Milovich, who slid down the hills of Ithaca, N.Y., on trays from the Cornell cafeteria, also seems to have strong claim on the first actual snowboard.

It is widely accepted that Jake Burton Carpenter (founder of Burton Snowboards) and/or Tom Sims (founder of Sims Snowboards) invented modern snowboarding. In 1981, a couple of Winterstick team riders went to France at the invitation of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs.

94_1	MARCO_4450169	The Beginning Of Snowboarding. It is hard to say who actually invented the first snowboard. People would have always figured out how to slide down a hill on some sled, thus it would be unfair to point out one specific person, who came up with the first snowboard. There were some people, though, who built snowboard like sleds before.

Originally the inspiration came from skateboarding, surfing, and skiing, the sport of snowboarding evolved in the United States back in the decades of the 1960s and 70s.
94_1	MARCO_7356511	Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Olympic and Paralympic sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet.

94_2	CAR_1da1987884fa4ee45e2a32680327528f515f6c4c	At the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, Snowboarding became an official Olympic event.  France's  Karine Ruby  was the first ever to win an Olympic gold medal for Woman's Snowboarding at the 1998 Olympics, while Canadian Ross Rebagliati was the first ever to win an Olympic gold medal for Men's Snowboarding.
94_2	CAR_335a0f3f3d72d354ab4c1747761a270097ace043	Rebagliati was born in  Vancouver , British Columbia. After turning pro in 1991, he was the first ever to win an  Olympic   gold medal  for Men's Snowboarding at the  1998 Winter Olympics . After winning the gold, he was found to have  Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  in his  circulatory system  following a  blood test  and he was automatically disqualified. This decision was eventually overturned, largely on the basis that marijuana was not on the list of banned substances, and Rebagliati was given back the medal. The next day he appeared on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and became an instant icon to many globally. THC has since been listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as a banned substance.  In 2013 however, WADA amended its rules on cannabis, raising the threshold for a positive test from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150 ng/ml. In 1998 at the Nagano Games, Rebagliati recorded a level of 17.8 ng/ml, and argued the test resulted from second-hand smoke, which he still says. Ben Nichols, a spokesperson for WADA, said the raising of the threshold is meant to catch only athletes who smoke during the period of a competition. The drug isn't prohibited out of competition.

Initially he was stripped of the medal when traces of marijuana were found in his blood during a drug test, but the IOC reversed its decision after an appeal a few days later because marijuana was only a restricted substance, not a banned substance.

Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to  giant slalom skiing ; and the  half-pipe , in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other.  Canadian   Ross Rebagliati  won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the  International Olympic Committee  (IOC) after testing positive for  marijuana . However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the  2002 Winter Olympics , the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In  2006 , a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.

Since he was too young at the time for official certification, at age fourteen he became an unofficial snowboard instructor at  Swain Ski Area  in upstate New York. Swain was one of the few places at the time that allowed snowboards on the trails. At the age of fourteen he also had his first athletics sponsorship, with the snowboard company  Barfoot . Blakley spent the next several years competing in contests, among them the  U.S. Snowboarding Open . At one point he competed in the slalom against  Ross Rebagliati , who would later go on to win a gold in the  1998 Winter Olympics . Recollected Blakley, "He's like this 'racer guy,' all decked out in racing gear, and I'm in big ol' baggy pants with a shitty freestyle board. I'm like, 'I'm gonna beat your ass! I'm gonna whup you!' He was all serious, and I was joking about it. Well, he finished like thirty seconds ahead of me."

94_3	CAR_2eb1e04ea0f399c7c22d070fc78f4473ec3aaf12	In 2002 Rick A. White invented a  snowboard binding rotating device  to minimize the torque force that occurs when a snowboarder has one foot out of the binding and one locked on the board. The rotating device allows the snowboarder to turn the locked foot straight into the direction of the tip of the snowboard without removing his boot from the boot binding. In 2004 the invention was first introduced on the SIA fare. In 2007 the rotating mechanism was implemented into a snowboard strap-in binding.
94_3	CAR_4505adef72edaa81c6da401b63b50cee73abf5da	These are the most popular bindings in snowboarding. Before snowboard specific boots existed, snowboarders used any means necessary to attach their feet to their snowboards and gain the leverage needed for turning. Typical boots used in these early days of snowboarding were Sorels or snowmobile boots. These boots were not designed for snowboarding and did not provide the support desired for doing turns on the heel edge of a snowboard. As a result, early innovators such as Louis Fournier conceived the "high-back" binding design which was later commercialized and patented by Jeff Grell. The highback binding is the technology produced by most binding equipment manufacturers in the snowboard industry. The leverage provided by highbacks greatly improved board control. Snowboarders such as Craig Kelly adapted plastic "tongues" to their boots to provide the same support for toe-side turns that the highback provided for heel-side turns. In response, companies such as Burton and Gnu began to offer "tongues".
94_3	CAR_4706248e63b20550db3aec4ff83cab4c83ab12cb	Bindings are separate components from the snowboard deck and are very important parts of the total snowboard interface. The bindings' main function is to hold the rider's boot in place tightly to transfer their energy to the board. Most bindings are attached to the board with three or four screws that are placed in the center of the binding. Although a rather new technology from  Burton  called Infinite channel system uses two screws, both on the outsides of the binding.
94_3	CAR_606db39e31a6b6dc368a23eeaa12f345ca6669da	Unlike ski bindings, snowboard bindings are not designed to release automatically in a fall. The mechanical support provided by the feet being locked to the board has the effect of reducing the likelihood of knee injury – 15% of snowboard injuries are to the knee, compared with 45% of all skiing injuries. Such injuries are typically to the knee ligaments, bone fractures are rare. Fractures to the lower leg are also rare but 20% of injuries are to the foot and ankle. Fractures of the  talus bone  are rare in other sports but account for 2% of snowboard injuries – a lateral process talus fracture is sometimes called "snowboarder's ankle" by medical staff. This particular injury results in persistent lateral pain in the affected ankle yet is difficult to spot in a plain X-ray image. It may be misdiagnosed as just a sprain, with possibly serious consequences as not treating the fracture can result in serious long-term damage to the ankle. The use of portable ultrasound for mountainside diagnostics has been reviewed and appears to be a plausible tool for diagnosing some of the common injuries associated with the sport.
94_3	CAR_7cb6d2b4c4f979909fc1a7e578e2bf765ba277b4	There are also proprietary systems that seek to combine the convenience of step-in systems with the control levels attainable with strap-ins. An example is the Flow binding system, which is similar to a strap-in binding, except that the foot enters the binding through the back.  The back flips down and allows the boot to slide in; it's then flipped up and locked into place with a clamp, eliminating the need to loosen and then re-tighten straps every time the rider frees and then re-secures their rear foot. The rider's boot is held down by an adjustable webbing that covers most of the foot. Newer Flow models have connected straps in place of the webbing found on older models; these straps are also micro adjustable. In 2004, K2 released the Cinch series, a similar rear-entry binding; riders slip their foot in as they would a Flow binding, however rather than webbing, the foot is held down by straps.
94_3	CAR_8c4d7a7d8eee2d2d1a6c3ffdd0d61e36dc0f37d7	With modern strap bindings, the rider wears a boot which has a thick but flexible sole, and padded uppers. The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped across the top of the toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.
94_3	CAR_af69e23883e499efbd6c1dba8b1450efb34f4ca7	Although initially refusing to expose themselves to the risk and expense associated with bringing a step-in system to market, Burton chose to focus primarily on improvements to existing strap-in technology. However, Burton eventually released 2 models of step-in systems, the SI and the PSI, Burton's SI system enjoyed moderate success, yet never matched the performance of the company's strap-in products and was never improved upon. Burton never marketed any improvements to either of their step-in binding systems and eventually discontinued the products.
94_3	CAR_c67a60bcd60a6d9a6df0615169e43da31c21c7f8	Snowboard  boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.
94_3	MARCO_8765621	What size bindings do i need? Hopefully we answered that question above but bindings are probably the easiest element to choose for your arsenal. Bindings only come in a few different size options, but each size accommodates a range of boot sizes. This makes finding the right size binding a quick and easy process. A couple other things to look at while shopping are different types of binding entry systems and board/boot/binding compatibility. There are several types of bindings, most are similar and utilize the traditional strap system.
94_4	CAR_041e7f014c4574187952ee599c6a64532f9b3b75	The risk of commercial failure from a poorly performing Step-in binding presented serious risk to established market leaders. This was evidenced by Airwalk who enjoyed 30% market share in snowboard boot sales when they began development of their step-in binding system. The Airwalk step-in System experienced serious product failure at the first dealer demonstrations, seriously damaging the company's credibility and heralded a decline in the company's former position as the market leader in Snowboard boots. Established snowboarding brands seeking to gain market share while reducing risk, purchased proven step-in innovators. For example, snowboard boot company Vans purchased the Switch step-in company, while Device step-in company was purchased by Ride Snowboards.

It allows the snowboarder to rotate the snowboard boot binding in relation to the snowboard by pulling upon a tether or releasing a lock. Repeating and rotating in the opposite direction leads back to the original angle position.

94_5	CAR_30f189230f22773f683fe469dcaab4546ad24ceb	Binding angle is defined by the degrees off of perpendicular from the length of the snowboard. A binding angle of 0° is when the foot is perpendicular to the length of the snowboard. Positive angles are pointed towards the front of the board, whereas negative angles are pointed towards the back of the board. The question of how much the bindings are angled depends on the rider's purpose and preference. Different binding angles can be used for different types of snowboarding. Someone who participates in freestyle competition would have a much different "stance" than someone who explores backcountry and powder. The recent advancement and boom of snowboard culture and technology has made binding angle adjustments relatively easy. Binding companies design their bindings with similar baseplates that can easily mount onto any type of snowboard regardless of the brand. With the exception of Burton, and their newly released "channel system", adjusting bindings is something that remains constant among all snowboarders. Done with a small screw-driver or a snowboard tool, the base plates on bindings can be easily rotated to whatever preferred stance. One must un-screw the baseplate, pick their degree angles, and then re-screw the baseplates. Bindings should also regularly be checked to ensure that the screws don't come undone from the movements of snowboarding.  
94_5	CAR_315969f42834fd291f85d942172cd1399ee473c9	Snowboarding boots should be well-fitted, with toes snug in the end of the boot when standing upright and slightly away from the end when in the snowboarding position. Padding or "armor" is recommended on other body parts such as hips, knees, spine, and shoulders. To further help avoid injury to body parts, especially knees, it is recommended to use the right technique. To acquire the right technique, one should be taught by a qualified instructor. Also, when snowboarding alone, precaution should be taken to avoid  tree well s, a particularly dangerous area of loose snow that may form at the base of trees.
94_5	CAR_3dc350eef52b75529ed62f901872466d8b896187	Snowboards are generally constructed of a hardwood core which is sandwiched between multiple layers of fibreglass. Some snowboards incorporate the use of more exotic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, aluminium (as a honeycomb core structure), and have incorporated piezo dampers. The front (or "nose") of the board is upturned to help the board glide over uneven snow. The back (or "tail") of the board is also upturned to enable backwards (or "switch") riding. The base (the side of the board which contacts the ground) is made of Polyethylene plastic.  The two major types of base construction are extruded and sintered.  An extruded base is a basic, low-maintenance design which basically consists of the plastic base material melted into its form.  A sintered base uses the same material as an extruded base, but first grinds the material into a powder, then, using heat and pressure, molds the material into its desired form.  A sintered base is generally softer than its extruded counterpart, but has a porous structure which enables it to absorb wax.  This wax absorption (along with a properly done 'hot wax'), greatly reduces surface friction between the base and the snow, allowing the snowboard to travel on a thin layer of water. Snowboards with sintered bases are much faster, but require semi-regular maintenance and are easier to damage. The bottom edges of the snowboard are fitted with a thin strip of steel, just a couple of millimeters wide.  This steel edge allows the board to grab or 'dig into' hard snow and ice (like the blade of an ice skate), and also protects the boards internal structure.  The top of the board is typically a layer of acrylic with some form of graphic designed to attract attention, showcase artwork, or serve the purpose similar to that of any other form of printed media. Flite Snowboards, an early designer, pressed the first closed-molded boards from a garage in Newport, Rhode Island, in the mid-1980s. Snowboard topsheet graphics can be a highly personal statement and many riders spend many hours customizing the look of their boards. The top of some boards may even include thin inlays with other materials, and some are made entirely of epoxy-impregnated wood.  The base of the board may also feature graphics, often designed in a manner to make the board's manufacturer recognizable in photos.
94_5	CAR_3e233037df0514fa9c319871edac9737b465a659	Innovators of step-in systems produced prototypes and designed proprietary step-in boot and binding systems with the goal of improving the performance of snowboard boots and bindings, and as a result, the mid-90s saw an explosion of step-in binding and boot development. New companies, Switch and Device, were built on new step-in binding technology. Existing companies Shimano, K2 and Emery were also quick to market with new step-in technology. Meanwhile, early market leaders Burton and Sims were noticeably absent from the step-in market. Sims was the first established industry leader to market with a step-in binding. Sims licensed a step-in system called DNR which was produced by the established ski-binding company Marker. Marker never improved the product which was eventually discontinued. Sims never re-entered the step-in market.
94_5	CAR_4505adef72edaa81c6da401b63b50cee73abf5da	These are the most popular bindings in snowboarding. Before snowboard specific boots existed, snowboarders used any means necessary to attach their feet to their snowboards and gain the leverage needed for turning. Typical boots used in these early days of snowboarding were Sorels or snowmobile boots. These boots were not designed for snowboarding and did not provide the support desired for doing turns on the heel edge of a snowboard. As a result, early innovators such as Louis Fournier conceived the "high-back" binding design which was later commercialized and patented by Jeff Grell. The highback binding is the technology produced by most binding equipment manufacturers in the snowboard industry. The leverage provided by highbacks greatly improved board control. Snowboarders such as Craig Kelly adapted plastic "tongues" to their boots to provide the same support for toe-side turns that the highback provided for heel-side turns. In response, companies such as Burton and Gnu began to offer "tongues".
94_5	CAR_4706248e63b20550db3aec4ff83cab4c83ab12cb	Bindings are separate components from the snowboard deck and are very important parts of the total snowboard interface. The bindings' main function is to hold the rider's boot in place tightly to transfer their energy to the board. Most bindings are attached to the board with three or four screws that are placed in the center of the binding. Although a rather new technology from  Burton  called Infinite channel system uses two screws, both on the outsides of the binding.
94_5	CAR_4f7d26b9667636f330adee47bb859f0f6537c3a3	In 2008, selling snowboarding equipment was a $487 million industry. In 2008, average equipment ran about $540 including board, boots, and bindings.
94_5	CAR_5dc0897ab997924723211e691f11dc8496741b8c	Sometimes called freecarving, this takes place on hard packed snow or groomed runs and focuses on carving linked turns, much like surfing or longboarding. Little or no jumping takes place in this discipline. Alpine Snowboarding consists of a small portion of the general snowboard population, that has a well connected social community and its own specific board manufacturers. Alpine Snowboard equipment is a ski-like hardshell boot and plate binding system with a true directional snowboard that is stiffer and narrower to manage linking turns with greater forces and speed. Shaped skis can thank these "freecarve" snowboards for the cutting-edge technology leading to their creation.  A skilled alpine snowboarder can link numerous turns into a run placing their body very close to the ground each turn, similar to a motogp turn or waterski carve. Depending on factors including stiffness, turning radius and personality this can be done slowly or fast.Carvers make perfect half-circles out of each turn, changing edges when the snowboard is perpendicular to the fall line and starting every turn on the downhill edge. Carving on a snowboard is like riding a roller coaster, because the board will lock into a turn radius and provide what feels like multiple Gs of acceleration.
94_5	CAR_6433c5d5e83643c61c6ab8dcd8c59b6a9ec09885	Snowboard bindings, unlike  ski bindings , do not automatically release upon impact or after falling over. With skis, this mechanism is designed to protect from injuries (particularly to the knee) caused by skis torn in different directions. Automatic release is not required in snowboarding, as the rider's legs are fixed in a static position and twisting of the knee joint cannot occur to the same extent. Furthermore, it reduces the dangerous prospect of a board hurtling downhill riderless, and the rider slipping downhill on his back with no means to maintain grip on a steep slope. Nevertheless, some ski areas require the use of a "leash" that connects the snowboard to the rider's leg or boot, in case the snowboard manages to get away from its rider. This is most likely to happen when the rider removes the board at the top or the bottom of a run (or while on a  chairlift , which could be dangerous).
94_5	CAR_acebc80b9a9032d1923976bdd1399a25ef8aff45	Different types of attire are needed for extreme weather conditions like snow. Thicker coats or jackets, gloves and boots are necessities in the cold. Winter sports such as snowboarding and skiing require the riders and skiers to be properly geared in the snow. Snow jackets differ from casual coats such that they may be packed with extra insulation and thicker coating materials. The insulation is usually made with down, which is the layer of fine feathers from geese or ducks. These feathers are naturally insulated to keep the birds warm in the harsh winter weathers. The feathers trap air inside and keep the body heat from flowing out. Down is also considered to be the highest quality of insulation for jackets. It is light and compressible. Alternative types of insulation are being invented including: synthetic microfibers and polyester-based insulation. These materials perform as well as down if not better and are becoming popular in the markets with the help of major brands using such materials for their equipment.
94_5	CAR_c67a60bcd60a6d9a6df0615169e43da31c21c7f8	Snowboard  boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.
94_5	CAR_cfd9b5caa18a887eec71b1fdd4c528040dd755be	In 2002, Todds and his friend, Cholo Burns, began selling rubber foot pads that could be attached to any snowboard. Their kits also included a bungee cord that attached to a point in front of the front foot, as well as a point behind the back foot. The cords acted like training wheels for riders who needed help keeping the board on their feet. They called their innovation Noboard. A Noboard is a kit to convert a  snowboard  into a board without  bindings . The conversion kit consists of a rubber pad (where the rider stands), a rope, retractable leash, and fastening hardware. Other companies are manufacturing boards designed to be ridden bindingless, as opposed to Noboard's conversion kit.
94_5	CAR_d22a3cc8295077aaf81bf0674e6dae26728de9d1	Snowboard  boot bindings are normally screwed onto the snowboard in a permanent orientation which is almost perpendicular to the direction of travel of the snowboard. When a snowboarder reaches the bottom of a run, the rear boot is typically released from its binding to allow the snowboarder to propel himself forward across relatively flat snow. Because the front foot in the snowboard binding is at an angle to forward motion, the snowboarder experiences discomfort and tension on his leg,  knee  and foot joint.
94_5	CAR_d62ca1ffb08e9b6c8449a57304d4686fd9de1cbd	Plate bindings are used with hardboots on Alpine or racing snowboards.  Extreme carvers  and some  Boarder Cross  racers also use plate bindings. The stiff bindings and boots give much more control over the board and allow the board to be carved much more easily than with softer bindings. Alpine snowboards tend to be longer and thinner with a much stiffer flex for greater edge hold and better carving performance.
94_5	CAR_e61d9a0da616d2d3fd84d7e08eeb88622d792207	The company started using a single-channel binding-mounting system on its 2008 models. In 2009, this system was installed on other snowboard lines. A binding system was offered with this system that was designed to give the rider more control as well as greater board feel.  This binding system named EST eliminates weight by mounting the binding to the board from the sides of the binding instead of the middle, getting rid of the middle baseplate.  One is also able to move the binding in another direction from before, back and forward.  The binding is able to adjust to ones specific needs.

Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.

The first training and education programs were developed in 1987, and in 1989 the association published its first snowboard-oriented education resource, the Snowboard Ski Instruction Manual. Embracing the full scope of how snowboarding fit within its educational tenets, PSIA formed AASI in 1997. Fully committed to sharing the passion of the skiing and riding experience, the organization is now known as PSIA-AASI.

The geographical name changed to Mount Bachelor in 1983 after the Bend Chamber of Commerce persuaded state and federal officials to adopt the more descriptive term "mountain." Well-known broadcaster and avid skier  Lowell Thomas  visited the young ski area in 1961, flying over from  Sun Valley  with  J. R. Simplot .  The first chair lift was Black chair in 1961, shortly followed by the red chair lift in 1964. In 1967 and 1970 the yellow and blue chair lifts were added, and in 1973 the green and orange chair lifts were added.  The following lifts were added afterwards and the names continue to this day. These lifts include outback in 1976, rainbow in 1980, and sunrise in 1982. The first area of the mountain developed for skiing was the northeastern side. The northwestern side was not lift-served in 1973, but those who ventured for the "Outback Trail Tour" paid a dollar in advance and got a return ride by a  sno-cat  to the lodge. A new trail was finished in 1975, and the Outback double chairlift was installed at a cost of $700,000. It was replaced by the $3 million  high-speed quad  (Outback Express) in the summer of 1987; with a capacity of 2,800 per hour. The lengthy Northwest Express chairlift was added in the summer of 1996, a high-speed quad with  vertical.

95_1	CAR_0506038b0a8f364a9cbb499399f1cbe8c1f5f75b		It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste.	Some claim that the key component to zero waste is  recycling  while others reject that notion in favor of reusing high function. The common understanding of recycling is simply that of placing bottles and cans in a recycle bin. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example, a 2007 report by the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  states that the US recycles at a national rate of 33.4% and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition many worldwide commodity industries have been created to handle the materials that are recycled. At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of  soil  and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the "recycled" column. In states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to pump up the recycling rate figures.	 The movement toward recycling has separated itself from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the  computer industry  where worldwide millions of PC's are disposed of as  electronic waste  each year (160 million in 2007). Those computers that enter the recycling stream are broken down into a small amount of  raw materials  while most merely enter dumps through export to  third world countries . Companies are then able to purchase some raw materials, notably  steel ,  copper  and  glass , reducing the use of new materials. On the other hand, there is an industry, more aligned with the Zero Waste principle of design for long term reuse, that actually repairs computers. It is called the  Computer Refurbishing  industry and it predates the current campaign to just collect and ship electronics. They have organizations and conferences and have for many years donated computers to schools, clinics and non-profits. Zero Waste planning demands that components be redesigned for effective reuse over long lives leading to even more refurbishing and repair.	There is one seminal example that brings out the difference between Zero Waste and recycling in stark relief. That example, quoted in Getting To Zero Waste, is the software business. Zero Waste is sensitive to the waste of intellectual effort that would be caused by the need to recreate certain basic inventions of software (called objects in software design) as opposed to copying them over and over whenever needed. The waste would occur as the software developers consume resources while solving problems already solved earlier. The application of Zero Waste analysis is straightforward as it recommends conserving human effort. On the other hand, the usual approach of recycling would be to look for some materials that could be found to reuse. The materials on which software is saved (such as paper or diskettes)is of little significance compared to the saving of human effort and if software is saved electronically, there is no media at all. Thus Zero Waste correctly identifies a wasteful behavior to avoid while recycling has no application.	The recycling movement has been embraced by the garbage industry because it serves so well as greenwashing i.e. a way to show that design for garbage creation is acceptable because materials will be kept out of a dump by recycling them. Zero Waste, on the other hand, offers the garbage industry no such screen against public condemnation of waste, and therefore actually threatens the continued need for garbage disposal. For example, in  Alameda County, California , garbage dumping is charged a surcharge of $8/ton (as of 2009) which goes entirely for a recycling subsidy but none of which goes for any kind of Zero Waste style designing. Zero Waste has received no support from the garbage industry or politicians under their control except in those cases where it can be claimed to consist solely of more recycling.

This community-based composting (CBC), in which residents put their food scraps into big composting barrels that sit on concrete bases and can hold up to 400 pounds, has been copied in over 26 cities in Bangladesh. This composting eliminates greenhouse gases produced by rotting garbage, which prompted World Wide Recycling to invest $8 million into Waste Concern’s new facilities.
95_1	CAR_26603fd0be1e31f6942ae0556d70cbe42d0781b2	Many sources state that the Zabbaleen have created one of the most efficient  recycling  systems in the world, which recycles up to 80 percent of all the waste that they collect. In contrast, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. According to Fahmi, 2005, "it was estimated that, in 1997, the Zabbaleen informally handled one-third of the garbage of Cairo’s 14 million people, mainly that from poorer districts," meaning that  the Zabbaleen collected up to 3,000 tons of garbage every day. The Zabbaleen are able to recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect through their family-run micro-enterprises that generate jobs, including those for production of handmade crafts from rags and paper, and incomes from some 40,000 people. In fact, according to Fahmi, "in the mid-1990s, nearly 700 Zabbaleen families owned collection enterprises, 200 owned and operated small- and medium-scale recycling enterprises, and 120 owned trading enterprises, in addition to maintenance workshops and community-based service businesses." What is distinctive about the Zabbaleen from many other urban informal waste collecting-groups that scavenge trash for useful products is that the Zabbaleen invest heavily in their tools and know-how for recycling.  These Zabbaleen micro-entrepreneurs have invested "an estimated 2.1 million Egyptian pounds (LE) (US $ 1⁄4 LE 6.19 -May 2004 rates) in trucks, plastic granulators, paper compactors, cloth grinders, aluminium smelters, and tin processors.". By investing in such infrastructure, the Zabbaleen continually upgraded and enhanced their methods of recycling plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, and fabrics. Thus, the city of  Cairo  and its administration had been able to manage its solid waste at almost no cost to the municipal administration because of such efforts by the Zabbaleen. Hence, the income that the Zabbaleen generate is mainly derived from their recycling and sorting activities, not from the minimal fees (LE 2-4) that they collect from residents.

Director Andrew Nisker takes the viewer to landfills, recycling centers and to the heart of Toronto’s multi-million dollar “wet garbage” processing plant—a place where Canadians’ food scraps, paper towels and kitty litter are processed into composting material. We learn about phosphates in our laundry detergent, heavy metals in our bodies, and how communities in Michigan deal with being the dumpster to Canada’s trash. The narrative then takes us to West Virginia, where residents in coal mining towns have had their homes, schools and lungs destroyed by the coal plants that supply Toronto’s power."

In 2009, Americans produced about 243 million tons of municipal solid waste, which is 4.3 pounds of waste per person per day. All that waste is sent to Landfill sites. Landfill gas which is produced from the decomposition of waste that gets accumulated at the landfills has the potential to be a valuable source of energy since methane is a major constituent. Currently, the majority of the landfills either burn away their gas in flares or combust it in mechanical engines to produce electricity. The issue with mechanical engines is that incomplete combustion of gasses can lead to pollution of the atmosphere and is also highly inefficient.

This is in contrast to some European countries where recycling and trash-to-energy processing is around 40-50%. Waste is converted to energy when the heat generated by  burning trash  is directed to boil water for steam to spin  turbine s. The  electricity  created by the spinning turbines is harnessed and sold to the region's  electrical grid .

In the poorest section of Fakulteta, Glavova  mahala , only one water outlet exists for 200 families. Until June 2003, medical services in the community were "non-existent". Because the city of Sofia does not provide garbage collection services, residents regularly burn their garbage; children have been documented burning old tires, causing them to be exposed to toxic gases which may contain carcinogens such as  dioxins . Another concern is the illegal dumping of solid and hazardous waste. Construction firms regularly dump potentially toxic waste in Fakulteta to skirt disposal regulations; a former green space in the settlement has been converted into an illegal disposal site.

Unlike other Indian cities, this garbage is collected by vehicles titled 'Ghantagadi' (meaning the vehicle with a bell): a system which has resulted in a 'garbage dump free' city. Smaller versions of the ghantagadi ply in the congested old city areas. A plant has been set by the Nashik Municipal Corporation near Pandav Leni ( Pandavleni Caves ) to process the garbage and convert into compost.

He found there was little difference between the sites because the garbage is compacted. The California landfills did have less paper than those in Illinois.  Recycling  is thought to be the cause of the paper difference between states. Rathje's research uncovered some other misconceptions about  landfill s. In particular, it was revealed that the rate of natural  biodegradation  is far slower than had been assumed (e.g., in capacity planning). It was found that the plastic bottles that were crushed at the top were able to be re-inflated easier than those that were at the bottom because of a new system of bottle making called light-weighting. This is the process of using less plastic in bottles to conserve material and save money. Light-weighting is not limited to plastic alone; this process is used for aluminum and paper as well. Rathje also found that Americans were wrong about what they thought they threw away most. When combined, the three most infamous types of trash—diapers, fast food containers, and Styrofoam—amounted to less than three percent of the landfill's waste. Rathje found that  plastic  was 20-24 percent of waste and  paper  alone was 40 percent of the waste found in landfills. Thirteen percent of this paper waste was from  newspapers . Rathje states the irony of this fact in his book. He talks about how newspapers are usually the ones that report things such as waste and  pollution  and it is these same newspapers clogging the landfills. Rathje discusses the rate of closing landfills and how for every six small landfills closed one large landfill opens. At the time he  published  his book he predicted that in the next five years 50 percent of the landfills open at the time would close. He determined this from his findings. In an effort for states to prevent their area becoming a large landfill often states  ship  their trash to other states. States such as  Michigan  are taking measures to prevent their state from being the landing spot for the nations trash. Michigan has found that in the past years most of their rise in trash rates are because of trash imports from  Canada .

Following the processing under steam and removal of toxic materials via  condensate  filtering, usable recyclables are immediately extracted for reuse (plastics,  ferrous  metals,  aluminum , glass, wood, etc.).
95_1	CAR_5df06f62ab03cafcdd2d541c5de699a6e044bd20	The process begins with the deposit of trash into intake hatches, called portholes, which may be specialized for waste, recycling, or compost. Portholes are located in public areas and on private property where the owner has opted in. The waste is then pulled through an underground pipeline by air pressure difference created by large industrial fans, in response to porthole sensors that indicate when the trash needs to be emptied and help ensure that only one kind of waste material is travelling through the pipe at a time. The pipelines converge on a central processing facility that uses automated software to direct the waste to the proper container, from there to be trucked to its final location, such as a landfill or composting plant.
95_1	CAR_61d28462de5d6c956545d49fdf8ee9c9069eb98b	Sewage and garbage disposal were simple tasks in the mostly rural parts of the colonies. Sewage was dumped into a stream or left in pits and buried. Scrap food was fed to farm animals and any other garbage or waste was burned or placed in a quiet corner of the property and left to deteriorate. However, in towns such as Halifax, Quebec City, Montreal and York (Toronto), these tasks became more difficult due to lack of space and the concentrated population, and the result was very unpleasant. Streets reeked with the smell of decaying garbage as well as pig, horse and cow excrement. Markets were places of animal blood, rotting animal carcasses and fish heads and other decaying organic matter. Human excrement was stored in pails in buildings and then dumped into the streets. Not until the mid-19th and early 20th centuries would these problems be effectively addressed through the installation of sewer systems and the organization of municipal garbage collection.

This means that while incineration does not completely replace  landfill ing, it significantly reduces the necessary volume for disposal.  Garbage truck s often reduce the volume of waste in a built-in compressor before delivery to the incinerator. Alternatively, at landfills, the volume of the uncompressed garbage can be reduced by approximately 70% by using a stationary steel compressor, albeit with a significant energy cost. In many countries, simpler  waste compaction  is a common practice for compaction at landfills.

Vtorma-Ecology Plant covered 90% of the city’s utilization of  municipal solid waste (MSW) . At that time  Almaty  accumulated about 600 tons of garbage per year. During 4.5–5 years, the company was to pay back $28 million investments and reach cost recovery by producing secondary materials -  PET  flex, plastic pellets, paper, ferrous and non-ferrous metals. But to the economic crisis the price of recyclables has fallen in 1,5-3 times, and the plant was not able to cover its costs and pay the loan, issued by "KazKom Bank". In October 2010 the plant was mothballed, criminal case of non-payment the wages was opened on Rustem Parmanbekov, director of the plant, and environmental prosecutor's office estimated the environmental damage in the amount of 7 million tenge.In September 2012 Agency for Construction, Housing and Utilities of RK has presented the Program of construction of 41 waste processing plants around Kazakhstan within 10–15 years. Particularly, the Agency plans to open 10 plants until 2015.As the Agency informs, the pilot projects will be launched in Aktobe, Atyrau, Karaganda, Abai, Saran, Shakhtinsk, Kostanay, Pavlodar, Taldykorgan, Taraz, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kokshetau, etc.These efforts will allow developing specific mechanisms of solid waste management in Kazakhstan and providing investors with one more sphere for investments.First of the objects within the Program is Astana Waste Processing Plant, which was planned to open in October 2012 and cover all city needs in MSW utilization, with its productivity of 400,000 tons per year. The opening ceremony was held on December 24, 2012. This is the second waste processing plant in Kazakhstan after Almaty plant. The Astana plant was built on basis of Spanish technology.As regards to Almaty Plant, which is still not operating, the Agency claims that owners have to deal with their economic problems themselves.The Program also covers  Shymkent city , which has a dramatic situation with spontaneously growing dump close to residential areas of the city. For residents of these neighborhoods proximity to the dump has turned into serious health problems. Due to constant acrid smoke and smell of burning people get such diseases as asthma, bronchitis etc.The plant in  Shymkent  was planned to be built in 2007: "Construction is scheduled to start next spring and finish by fall," - declared the subcontractor in January 2007. But the choice of the landfill and other issues took more time than planned.Only in December 2009 an investment agreement with Shymkent Akimat was signed and area for polygon and plant was defined. In Fall 2011 it was again announced that construction of the plant begins. Municipal budget allocated 430 million tenge for the necessary infrastructure needs. Until the end of the year builders acquired approximately 20 million tenge.But in April 2012, Akimat refused to continue funding the project. For the moment the project is still frozen. Operation of the plant is now under threat due to insufficient funds for restoration and permanent increase of the area of garbage dump.The Agency for Construction, Housing and Utilities of RK has also named the city of Pavlodar among the first cities, where the plants will be built until 2015. For the moment, Pavlodar Akimat has announced that they have already chosen the place of 100 hectares for the construction of polygon. Work is expected to deploy on the existing city dump.Another plant is planned to be constructed in Karaganda. By today, "Taza Dala" company was founded to manage this project, places for construction and polygon have been chosen. Now there are negotiations being held with several banks to participate in the project.Finally, in December 2012 it was announced that the modern  MSW  processing plant will be built in Aktau with support of  EBRD : 2.4 billion tenge (€12.7 million equivalent) loan to State Communal Enterprise Koktem, Aktau’s waste management company, will co - finance the new integrated mechanical-biological treatment facility and a new sanitary landfill. The project will be co-financed by the  Clean Technology Fund  which is providing a US$8 million loan.The project will also be supported by a capital grant from the state budget.The Korean Donor Fund provided nearly €300,000 and the  EBRD Shareholder Special Fund is providing grants of nearly €800,000 for project management, design, engineering, training, operational improvements and other associated spending.

It is the first system able to process Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in continuous mode. The Plant is able to process up to 40.000 tons per year without previous selection, and the system has been internationally patented by ECOHISPÁNICA. The process just applies water steam, pressure, temperature, and some internal movement... In about 20 minutes, the main part of the garbage (organic matter), is converted into a kind of biomass, very clean, that you can touch with your hands, storable, and valid for composting, for gassification, or power generation (the calorific power is about 3.500 kcal/kg). The rest of materials like plastic or metals, are very easy to select once garbage has been processed into the Waste Cleaner. The advantages of this technology are really impressive: It makes possible the goal of zero landfill, the volume of the garbage is reduced more than 80%, the operational costs are significantly reduced, no emissions,the employees work in very clean conditions, it increases a lot the efficiency in respect to other technologies,and is very fast (20 minutes are enough). The Plant of ECOHISPÁNICA is in the city of Rivas Vaciamadrid (Madrid), one of the most  prestigious cities in Spain in environment and new technologies. Visits from more than 80 countries have been received in the Plant in the last 2 years. ECOHISPÁNICA is releasing the Waste Cleaner to the world market, and installation of Plants in China, USA, Argentina, Chile, Israel, Brazil, Ghana and Spain is programmed for 2016 and 2017.

There is a  sewage treatment  plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks.  Siruthuli , an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de- silt ing of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river.

Others counter by pointing out that there are huge tracts of land available throughout the USA and other countries which could be used for dumps. The underlying need to move to a society designed along Zero Waste principles arises from the huge waste of resources that is inherent in poorly made, short-lived articles and production processes. The locus of the most egregious wasting takes place as articles are built and processes are run wastefully. The actual placing of a now useless item in a dump is barely the icing on the cake, in terms of the waste it represents. Poorly conceived proposals, that appear with a dismaying regularity on the Internet, to blithely destroy all garbage as a way to solve the garbage problem, make use of the common delusion that it is the garbage itself which is the problem. These proposals typically claim to convert all or a large portion of existing garbage into oil and sometimes claim to produce so much oil that the world will henceforth have abundant liquid fuels. One such plan, called Anything Into Oil was promoted by Discover Magazine and Fortune Magazine in 2004, even though it absurdly claimed to be able to convert a refrigerator into "light Texas crude" by the application of high pressure steam. Zero Waste analysis, which is long on scientific results and short on spectacular claims, receives no such promotion by the media.
95_1	CAR_84628e79509e0e26b1d888956daf23e0043fefac	Kazakhstan  has practically no waste recycling enterprises. The few currently operating recyclers face a number of financial and organizational constraints. For instance, in Pavlodar there are two enterprises employing unique technologies (up to 96% of waste is used in the production process). They are: Pavlodar Ash-Sludge Waste Processing Plant JSC and EMEKO JSC. The base raw materials used by these enterprises are bauxite slime ofAluminum of Kazakhstan JSC and ash waste of Pavlodar TES-1, resulting from combustion of Ekibastuz coal with a high ash content. The plant produces 14 kinds of construction materials, such as brick (including fire-resistant), cement, etc. Provided the plant operates on a two-shift basis, it can annually process 32,000 tons of slime and 38 tons of ash. However, it cannot operate at full capacity due to lack of working capital.Enterprises of the ore dressing and metallurgical complexes, petrochemical, heat-and-power generating facilities, coal pits, etc. use industrial waste for the mining-technical reclamation of tailings, ash dumps, overburden dumps and hosting rocks. Thus, in waste-intensive areas (East Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kostanai and Pavlodar oblasts) the percentage of industrial waste usage varies, from 1.5-2% in Pavlodar oblast to 25% in Karaganda oblast. A high level of waste utilization has been achieved in this oblast in the last two years mainly due to the use of overburden and hosting rocks for technical reclamation of up to 85% of the used and disturbed land.The metallurgical slime stored on test sites is usually buried. This is largely due to lack of efficient and cost-effective recycling technologies. A small part of the waste is used in production and construction technologies by Ispat-Karmet JSC (Karaganda oblast), where practically all metallurgical slag is processed and reused. Zhairem Tsvet Мет JSC and the Balkhash smelter of  Kazakhmys Corporation  process all the metallurgical slag accumulated throughout the year, together with ore, in the production of copper concentrate.The following technologies of waste processing and neutralization are applied at Sokolovsko-Sarbaisky smelter (Kostanai Oblast): crushing of rocks for construction; use of mill tailings in the extraction of collective sulfide concentrate by a floatation unit and its further processing at the mining-chemical integrated works, although this technology has yet to be finalized.In 2000 Maikainzoloto OJSC (Pavlodar Oblast) started to use off-balance ores from overburdened soil dumps, including dumps located in the Maikain settlement. Maikainzoloto JSC, jointly with Technopark- Stepnogorsk JSC, plans to apply environmentally friendly technology in the production of the copper-zinc concentrate without cyanides.Ferrochrome JSC (Aktyube Oblast) is an example of successful industrial waste utilization and processing. This JSC has started to produce crushed stone from the scoria of high and low-carbon ferrochrome (more than150.0	tons per year) and ferrodust (more than 4,000 tons per year) which is further used in the manufacturing of lime-and-sand brick (more than 12,000 pieces per year). In addition, the company plans to use a bin for the reception and sorting out of the waste for further recycling. A dedicated area will be used to store metal scrap.Private sector participation in solid waste disposal helps to raise significantly the efficiency of recycling. For instance, in Pavlodar the situation improved after solid waste management was transferred to Polygon MDS JSC (accumulator of solid waste of III-IV class of hazard) and Spetsmashiny JSC (the city solid waste land fill). Another private company, which is part of Pavlodar Chemical Plant JSC, is engaged in collection, employing the technology of Tolyatti IFC Chelnok JSC ( Russia ). The enterprise has so far recycled more than 90,000 lamps. Experimental work has been conducted on ‘demercurization’ in the use of fluorescent lamps of Petropavlovsk by ZIKSTO JSC. In Almaty oblast the mercury-containing waste and fluorescent lamps are delivered for demercurization to the specialized enterprise Synap JSC (Almaty). A facility for the centralized collection, storage and recycling of utilized luminescent, mercury lamps and devices has been opened in Uralsk, western Kazakhstan.Recycling efforts are being made in West Kazakhstan also. For instance, Stroitekh JSC has begun to recycle broken glass and produce consumer goods from them. A similar project is being developed by Zheksengaly JSC. Uralvtorma Research and Production Association has designed a project on recycling wood-shavings, scrap paper, wool to produce composite building slabs used in the construction industry.In order to resolve the problem of waste management, it is necessary to develop a National Waste Management Program, spelling out waste management policies, a legal framework and methodology for waste disposal, an economic mechanism for waste management and monitoring. Implementation of this program requires: an inventory of existing tailings and dumps and assessment of their technical condition; specification and analysis of flows, volumes and components of accumulated and buried waste; assessment of risks for decision-making.

The process is applicable to the  incineration  of municipal garbage, an activity becoming increasingly common in Europe and responsible for the production of hazardous  fly ash . Carbon8's accelerated carbonation processes make the byproduct of garbage incineration cheaper to dispose of and can also produce aggregates which can then be used as construction materials. Carbon8 claims to have produced the world's first commercially available  carbon negative  aggregates. In 2012, the University of Greenwich said that the processes also had potential use in the management of  nuclear wastes . Commercial prospects for accelerated carbonation attracted the interest of Grundon Waste Management, which has since invested millions of pounds in the establishment of a new company called  Carbon8 Aggregates  Ltd.

In 2010,  Americans  generated about  of trash. In the  United States ,  landfills  are regulated by the  Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) and the states' environmental agencies. Municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLF) are required to be designed to protect the  environment  from  contaminants  that may be present in the solid waste stream.

Recycling reduces the use of raw materials, the creation and use of energy and pollution (air, water and land). Recycling is maintained and run through drop-offs for various materials, buy back centers, curbside collection areas, etc. All of these are done in addition to landfill waste; for instance, there may be a recycling bin next to a garbage can.

Garbage compactors and waste collection vehicles compress waste so that more of it can be stored in the same space. Waste is compacted again, more thoroughly, at the  landfill  to conserve valuable airspace and to extend the landfill's life span. A side effect of this is that important items, like evidence in a crime, may be difficult to recover from the garbage. Due to reduced  oxygenation ,  biodegradation  of organic waste is also slowed.
95_1	CAR_cfea9e6448377f62ebf07fb0b5e69ed110c7f5cd	Disposing trash on Earth mainly comes in three ways: littering, incinerating, and storing in it the many landfills we have around the world. With today’s landfills, there are very constructed contaminate structures. These systems are designed to help keep solid waste from becoming too uncontained and uncontrolled from the environment and the impact it could have on the health of humans. The purpose of having a liner system within a  landfill  is mainly to isolate everything within the landfill from the environment and protect it from contaminating the contents of the soil and especially the water within the ground. These liners are engineered to create a physical barrier between the garbage within the landfill, the ground, and the environment, in order to separate the liquid contaminate ( leachate ) so that it can go to a treatment facility. There are different types of these landfill sites for the different types of solid wastes which society creates and leaves behind. There are certain levels of harmfulness in which the different types of trash have; therefore, there are different types of liner systems which are required for these different types of disposal sites. The first type is single liner-systems. These systems usually are put within landfills which mostly hold construction rubble. These landfills are not meant to hold the disposal of harmful liquid wastes such as paint, tar, or any other type of liquid garbage that can easily seep through a single liner system. The second type is  double-liner  systems. These systems are usually found in municipal solid waste landfills as well all hazardous waste landfills. The first part is constructed to collect the leachate while the second layer is engineered to be a leak-detection system to ensure that no contaminates leak into the ground and contaminate everything.
95_1	CAR_de3c096dda497dda23988d9642a69acdddf3c4f2	An established post-treatment system is classification processing. In this system, the waste streams are separated into different types of waste materials. The types of waste materials are classified into recyclable materials, hazardous materials, organic materials, inorganic materials. Generally, waste materials are separated using mechanical separation and manual separation. Mechanical separations are used for separating metals and other materials that may be harmful to the environment, and also to prepare the waste stream for manual separations. Manual separation have two types of sorting which are positive sorting and negative sorting. Positive sorting collects reusable waste such as recyclable and organic materials while negative sorting collects unusable waste such as hazardous and inorganic materials. After this separation process, the recyclable materials are transferred for reuse. The organic wastes are often treated using chemical processes (e.g. combustion, pyrolysis etc.) or biological treatment (microbial decomposition). The products obtained from these waste organic materials are in the form of  Refuse-Derived Fuel . RDF can be used in many ways to generate electricity or even used alongside with traditional sources of fuel in coal power plants. The rest of the hazardous and unwanted inorganic wastes are transferred to landfill to be disposed. These post-treatment processes are crucial to sustain the environment.

Instead, garbage is separated at the source, into  compostable  and other types of garbage and collected. Similarly, in the  United States  there have been some political and  environmental issues  with garbage disposers. For many years,  New York City  had  ban ned their use. The stated reason was the above-mentioned increased sewage treatment capacity, but many area residents also suspected that it was the garbage  unions  not wanting work taken away from them. The ban was rescinded on September 11, 1997.

Since Sheridan Hollow is a ravine and the smoke stacks are high enough to be at the level with the surrounding rim most of the pollution from the stacks ended up in neighboring Arbor Hill. Allen Hershkowitz, director of the Solid Waste and Energy Project for INFORM, a conservation research organization, said of the plant in 1986 that it "is the worst plant I've seen in the world." The garbage burning aspect of the plant was closed in 1994 by order of  Governor   Mario Cuomo .

95_1	CAR_fc461cf0967b5031e37e06aafd016033acb8748e	The term zero waste was first used publicly in the name of a  company , Zero Waste Systems Inc. (ZWS), which was founded by  PhD  chemist Paul Palmer in the mid-1970s in  Oakland, California . The mission of ZWS was to find new homes for most of the chemicals being excessed by the nascent  electronics  industry. They soon expanded their services in many other directions. For example, they accepted free of charge, large quantities of new and usable  laboratory  chemicals which they resold to experimenters, scientists, companies and tinkerers of every description during the 1970s. ZWS arguably had the largest inventory of laboratory chemicals in all of  California , which were sold for half price. They also collected all of the solvent produced by the electronics industry called developer/rinse (a mixture of  xylene  and  butyl acetate ). This was put into small cans and sold as a  lacquer   thinner . ZWS collected all the "reflow oil" created by the printed circuit industry, which was filtered and resold into the "downhole" (oil well) industry. ZWS pioneered many other projects.	Because they were the only ones in the world in this business, they achieved an international reputation. Many magazine articles were written about them and several television shows featured them. The California Integrated Waste Management Board produced a slide show featuring ZWS's business and the EPA published a number of studies of their business, calling them an "active waste exchange".	The heir to the ZWS mantle is the Zero Waste Institute (ZWI), also founded by Paul Palmer, which can be found on http://www.zerowasteinstitute.org. Building on the lessons learned from ZWS, the ZWI considers recycling to be no more than an appendage to garbage creation and the garbage industry. ZWI likewise rejects all attempts to reuse garbage or any kind of waste product. Instead, ZWI calls for the redesign of all of the products of industry and commerce, and the processes that produce, sell and make use of them, so that discard never takes place and there is no waste generated needing to be reused or recycled. Discard is seen as the critical step, a commercial and psychological transfer of responsibility which breaks the chain of custody of a product, removes its owner and subjects it to the degradation of garbage management.	The website offers numerous specific examples of ways in which products can be designed so that discard is unnecessary since the lifetime of the product is extended to at least a threshold value of approximately a human lifetime of 100 years. A fully worked out set of principles and analysis is presented, revolving, among other changes, around standardization,  modularization  and  robust design . A theory of  design efficiency  leading to design effectiveness is presented, which means that once a product is designed to be used in perpetuity, it can be fitted out with robust features, strong materials and special conveniences that could not be afforded in a product designed to be discarded after a single use. That theory is applied to packages as an example.	The ZWI rejects all association with the world of recycling, pointing out that there is no theory of recycling in existence; only a trusting hope that it can be useful.

Lindsay reflected in his 1969 book The City that "Every time you shut down an incinerator, you increase the amount of garbage on city streets." Environmental harms — especially those that created obvious and unpleasant effects like smog — exacerbated  the flight of middle-class residents from the city , resulting in a loss of financial and human resources. Residents who remained in the city, often poorer than those who could afford to flee, were left acutely impacted by problems that stemmed from city reactions to pollution or lack of municipal resources, for example, uncollected garbage in the streets.

Ships can also have a significant impact in areas without large commercial ports: they contribute about 37 percent of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the  Santa Barbara  area, and that percentage is expected to increase to 61 percent by 2015. Again, there is little cruise-industry specific data on this issue. They comprise only a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas that are visited repeatedly. Shipboard incinerators also burn large volumes of garbage, plastics, and other  waste , producing ash that must be disposed of. Incinerators may release toxic emissions as well.

Until the early 90’s, most waste in Israel ended up in unregulated garbage dumps. Following a government order implemented in 1993, the unregulated dumps were closed due to severe contamination of local sources of surface and groundwater. As of 2010, approximately 65% of solid waste in Israel was disposed of via burning and land-filling and approximately 30% was recycled. The issue of limited space has led to pollutants from landfills finding their way into the environment and sources of drinking water. As of 2013, approximately half a million Israelis did not have access to proper sewage infrastructure and waste disposal. In other areas, rapid improvements in the standard of living has resulted in a 4-5% annual increase in solid waste, with the average quantity reaching approximately 11,300 tons per year.

Dioxins and furans are considered by many to be serious health hazards.

(Horton, 1982). Horton probably underestimates the effect that Aboriginal people have had on Australian environment. Aboriginal burning generally took place at appropriate times of the year, and when weather conditions were right. This ensured that there was a low intensity burn, and therefore little danger of a  crown fire  developing. Traditional burning patterns maximised the species diversity in any particular area, because burning tended to leave a mosaic of vegetation which had been burned at different times.

According to a World Bank report, “Pakistan’s urban air pollution is among the most severe in the world and it engenders significant damages to human health and the economy”. The inefficient use of energy, an increase in the number of vehicle used daily, an increase in unregulated industrial emissions and the burning of garbage and plastic have contributed the most to air pollution in urban areas. According to a recent study, Pakistan's Environment Protection Department claims that the average level of pollution in big cities is approximately four times higher than the  World Health Organisation  limits. These emissions have detrimental effects, ranging from “ respiratory disease s, reduced visibility, loss of vegetation and an effect on the growth of plants.”  However one of the greatest contributor to air pollution is industrial activity. The inadequate air emission treatments and lack of regulatory control over industrial activity has contributed to the deterioration of ambient air quality in major cities. In addition, the common practice of burning massive amounts of solid waste, including plastic and rubber, on street corners by the public releases toxic gases, which are extremely harmful for residents in the area.

Moreover, some dumps are located in environmentally sensitive locations or close to residential areas. These problems are caused by a lack of governmental regulations and public commitment but also a lack of technical knowledge, low financial resources and too little suitable space for waste disposal sites. The effects of poor waste management is waste laying in the streets, waterways and swamps. These results influence the aesthetic of the landscape, decrease the  biodiversity , cause health problems and have negative impacts on Sri Lanka’s tourist industry. The study shows that in areas without waste collection, the majority of people dump their waste that should be going to the  landfill  in their backyard.  Plastic s and  paper  are often burned or also disposed in the backyard. Moreover,  green waste  is burned by 80% of the household in the southern provinces that do not have access to waste collection.

It is the first system able to process Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in continuous mode. The Plant is able to process up to 40.000 tons per year without previous selection, and the system has been internationally patented by ECOHISPÁNICA. The process just applies water steam, pressure, temperature, and some internal movement... In about 20 minutes, the main part of the garbage (organic matter), is converted into a kind of biomass, very clean, that you can touch with your hands, storable, and valid for composting, for gassification, or power generation (the calorific power is about 3.500 kcal/kg). The rest of materials like plastic or metals, are very easy to select once garbage has been processed into the Waste Cleaner. The advantages of this technology are really impressive: It makes possible the goal of zero landfill, the volume of the garbage is reduced more than 80%, the operational costs are significantly reduced, no emissions,the employees work in very clean conditions, it increases a lot the efficiency in respect to other technologies,and is very fast (20 minutes are enough). The Plant of ECOHISPÁNICA is in the city of Rivas Vaciamadrid (Madrid), one of the most  prestigious cities in Spain in environment and new technologies. Visits from more than 80 countries have been received in the Plant in the last 2 years. ECOHISPÁNICA is releasing the Waste Cleaner to the world market, and installation of Plants in China, USA, Argentina, Chile, Israel, Brazil, Ghana and Spain is programmed for 2016 and 2017.

Achmadi, a small-scale Indonesian farmer, sets fire to his newly acquired piece of forest to clear it for palm oil. But he too has to face up to the impact of his burning on the global climate. And in Borneo, Danish-born Lone Drøscher-Nielsen rescues and cares for orangutans injured or orphaned by the fires. As she prepares for the release of rehabilitated orangutans back into the wild, the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali commences. Everything hinges on whether all the countries of the world can agree on the wording of a new climate change protocol and whether protection of forests will be included.

Despite spending 30–50% of operation budgets on waste management, developing world cities today collect only 50–80% of refuse generated by inhabitants. Residents and businesses often resort to burning garbage or disposing of it streets, rivers, vacant lots, and  open dump s. This is a source of air, land, and water pollution that threatens human health and the environment. Informal waste collectors help mitigate this harm by collecting recyclable materials by foot or in pushcarts, tricycles, donkey carts, horse carts, and pickup trucks.

For example, many  cement kiln s burn HWs like used oils or solvents. Today, incineration treatments not only reduce the amount of hazardous waste, but also generate energy from the gases released in the process. It is known that this particular waste treatment releases toxic gases produced by the combustion of byproduct or other materials which can affect the environment. However, current technology has developed more efficient incinerator units that control these emissions to a point where this treatment is considered a more beneficial option.  There are different types of incinerators which vary depending on the characteristics of the waste. Starved air incineration is another method used to treat hazardous wastes. Just like in common incineration, burning occurs, however controlling the amount of oxygen allowed proves to be significant to reduce the amount of harmful byproducts produced. Starved air incineration is an improvement of the traditional incinerators in terms of air pollution. Using this technology, it is possible to control the combustion rate of the waste and therefore reduce the air pollutants produced in the process.

95_3	CAR_2e5cc5705ddaa66f7fc0f5773cf037287848d1ff	MuSIASEM or Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism, is a method of accounting used to analyse socio-ecosystems and to simulate possible patterns of development. It is based on maintaining coherence across  scales  and different dimensions (e.g. economic, demographic, energetic) of quantitative assessments generated using different metrics. It is designed to detect and analyze patterns in the societal use of resources and the impacts they create on the environment. The approach was created around 1997 by Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi, and has been developed since then by the members of the IASTE (Integrated Assessment: Sociology, Technology and the Environment) group at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and its external collaborators. MuSIASEM strives to characterize metabolic patterns of Socio-Ecological Systems (how and why humans use resources and how this use depends on and affects the stability of the ecosystems embedding the society). This integrated approach allows for a quantitative implementation of the  DPSIR  framework (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses) and application as a decision support tool. Different alternatives of the option space can be checked in terms of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control), viability (compatibility with processes under human control) and desirability (compatibility with normative values and institutions). The ability to integrate quantitative assessments across dimensions and scales makes MuSIASEM particularly suited for different types of sustainability analysis: (i) the nexus between food, energy, water and land uses; (ii) urban metabolism; (iii) waste metabolism; (iv) tourism metabolism; (v) rural development.
95_3	CAR_48959364d1f88dd0735f417f0caee4eb512c5645	He started by  surveying  different areas of the country to better understand what types of garbage survives under different  climates . He found there was little difference between the sites because the garbage is compacted. The California landfills did have less paper than those in Illinois.  Recycling  is thought to be the cause of the paper difference between states. Rathje's research uncovered some other misconceptions about  landfill s. In particular, it was revealed that the rate of natural  biodegradation  is far slower than had been assumed (e.g., in capacity planning). It was found that the plastic bottles that were crushed at the top were able to be re-inflated easier than those that were at the bottom because of a new system of bottle making called light-weighting. This is the process of using less plastic in bottles to conserve material and save money. Light-weighting is not limited to plastic alone; this process is used for aluminum and paper as well. Rathje also found that Americans were wrong about what they thought they threw away most. When combined, the three most infamous types of trash—diapers, fast food containers, and Styrofoam—amounted to less than three percent of the landfill's waste. Rathje found that  plastic  was 20-24 percent of waste and  paper  alone was 40 percent of the waste found in landfills. Thirteen percent of this paper waste was from  newspapers . Rathje states the irony of this fact in his book. He talks about how newspapers are usually the ones that report things such as waste and  pollution  and it is these same newspapers clogging the landfills. Rathje discusses the rate of closing landfills and how for every six small landfills closed one large landfill opens. At the time he  published  his book he predicted that in the next five years 50 percent of the landfills open at the time would close. He determined this from his findings. In an effort for states to prevent their area becoming a large landfill often states  ship  their trash to other states. States such as  Michigan  are taking measures to prevent their state from being the landing spot for the nations trash. Michigan has found that in the past years most of their rise in trash rates are because of trash imports from  Canada .

95_3	CAR_65c3a0a69d1d4b9735d0294ff5ec87f8d1be4e17	Pre-landfill waste compaction is often beneficial, both for people disposing of waste and the company collecting it. This is because  waste collection  companies frequently charge by volume or require use of standard-volume containers, and compaction allows more waste to fit in the same space. Trash  compactors  are available for both residential and commercial use. Compacting garbage after it is collected allows more waste to fit inside the collection vehicle, meaning fewer trips to a  dump  or  transfer station  are required. The collection company also incurs lower landfill fees, if the landfill charges by volume 1.
95_3	CAR_7476297dc34bb2629a3e436bca310a792d133640	Incineration and compaction have traditionally been treatment options and still compete with newer technologies by virtue of having a proven track record.  These solutions are widely recognized as obsolete due to their impact on the biosphere; while compaction has nearly no effect on the long-term goal of reducing waste dumping, incineration had been notorious for polluting the atmosphere.  While incineration is popular for its ability to recover energy from waste, it has been widely debated and regulated in order to preserve clean air.  One solution that had been instituted to update incineration technology is to add converter stations into the supply chain of clean-burning RDF, of refuse-derived fuel.  This, along with advanced filtering and condensation scrubbers was able to render energy recovery from waste a feasible and eco-friendly solution.
95_3	CAR_801459d2dba4fdfa7be76c211210166faa721f9e	A landfill compaction vehicle has two main functions: to spread the waste evenly in layers over the landfill, and to compact waste to reduce its volume and help stabilize the landfill. Proper waste compacting includes the process of using a steel wheeled/drum landfill  compactor  to  shred , tear and press together various items in the waste stream so they consume a minimal volume of landfill airspace. The higher the compaction rate, the more trash the landfill can receive and store. This will also reduce  landslide s,  cave-in s and minimize the risk of  explosion s of  landfill gas  (see  landfill gas migration ).

At its height there were more than 600 truckloads a day. Since clean-up began, more than 12,000,000 miles have been logged. Processing is done by compacting waste and hazardous materials to make sure no air pockets remain. After adding support to the waste by adding cement blocks so the area will not sag, a temporary cap is placed over the waste until a permanent cap seals all the waste off from the site.
95_3	CAR_93e6edaed15d66b39c0b5fe587dd3b00880b904f	The landfill material consists of up to 45 feet of poorly compacted municipal and industrial waste. Typical waste found within the landfill includes the following: chemicals, drums, paper, cardboard, organic matter, wood, glass, metal, rubber, rocks, concrete, and other materials. The base of the landfill material has been compressed into, and mixed with, the upper part of the Bay Mud. The volume of waste in the landfill is approximately 2.5 million cubic yards and total tonnage of this material is approximately 1.4 million tons. This volume of waste would cover a football field almost to the height of the Empire State Building. 
95_3	CAR_99773ebcc02a0f33bfe575c64a831cd4c87f5d1d	Compost ing is the process of taking organic solid waste, like food, paper and landscaping waste and allowing it to be broken down by microorganisms, creating a nutrient rich fertilizer to be used in food production or in landscaping. Once organic waste is placed in a pile, millions of microorganisms come from the soil to help break down the food waste. There are different types of microorganisms that are found in compost piles, depending on the temperature and pH of the compost pile, which can be determined by the types of waste introduced to the compost pile. In the beginning phase,  mesophilic bacteria  jump-start the decomposition process by breaking down all of the most easily decompostable material, raising the temperature to a level that the next phase of microorganisms thrive in. In the next phase of decomposition,  thermophilic microorganisms  further break down fats, proteins and complex carbohydrates. It is during this thermophilic phase that temperatures inside of a compost pile can reach above 60 °C, killing most human pathogens that may have been introduced. Once the maximum temperature has been reached, the thermophilic microorganisms tend to slow down and are replaced with more mesophilic bacteria, which continue organic breakdown. During these phases larger organisms like flies, mites and beetles also aid in the breakdown of organic matter. The time it takes for fresh organic waste to be completely decomposed is dependent on multiple factors: microorganisms present, water content, oxygen content, and surrounding air temperature, for example.
95_3	CAR_a58a2b40a3b72720b3561cd06f64f55eb1b06251	Biodegradation is the disintegration of materials by  bacteria ,  fungi , or other biological means.  Although often conflated, biodegradable is distinct in meaning from  compostable . While biodegradable simply means to be consumed by  microorganism s, "compostable" makes the specific demand that the object break down under  composting  conditions. The term is often used in relation to ecology,  waste management , biomedicine, and the natural environment ( bioremediation ) and is now commonly associated with environmentally friendly products that are capable of decomposing back into natural elements. Organic material can be degraded  aerobically  with  oxygen , or  anaerobically , without oxygen.  Biosurfactant , an extracellular surfactant secreted by microorganisms, enhances the biodegradation process.
95_3	CAR_ceaa49bdec39db2a76a6a8528e70a6830433f8d8	Waste compaction is the process of compacting  waste , reducing it in size. Garbage compactors and waste collection vehicles compress waste so that more of it can be stored in the same space. Waste is compacted again, more thoroughly, at the  landfill  to conserve valuable airspace and to extend the landfill's life span. A side effect of this is that important items, like evidence in a crime, may be difficult to recover from the garbage. Due to reduced  oxygenation ,  biodegradation  of organic waste is also slowed.
95_3	CAR_cfea9e6448377f62ebf07fb0b5e69ed110c7f5cd	Disposing trash on Earth mainly comes in three ways: littering, incinerating, and storing in it the many landfills we have around the world. With today’s landfills, there are very constructed contaminate structures. These systems are designed to help keep solid waste from becoming too uncontained and uncontrolled from the environment and the impact it could have on the health of humans. The purpose of having a liner system within a  landfill  is mainly to isolate everything within the landfill from the environment and protect it from contaminating the contents of the soil and especially the water within the ground. These liners are engineered to create a physical barrier between the garbage within the landfill, the ground, and the environment, in order to separate the liquid contaminate ( leachate ) so that it can go to a treatment facility. There are different types of these landfill sites for the different types of solid wastes which society creates and leaves behind. There are certain levels of harmfulness in which the different types of trash have; therefore, there are different types of liner systems which are required for these different types of disposal sites. The first type is single liner-systems. These systems usually are put within landfills which mostly hold construction rubble. These landfills are not meant to hold the disposal of harmful liquid wastes such as paint, tar, or any other type of liquid garbage that can easily seep through a single liner system. The second type is  double-liner  systems. These systems are usually found in municipal solid waste landfills as well all hazardous waste landfills. The first part is constructed to collect the leachate while the second layer is engineered to be a leak-detection system to ensure that no contaminates leak into the ground and contaminate everything.

This method prevents the creation of safety and public health hazards; this landfill has four requirements before it is built. The first requirement is that it must have absolute  leachate  security; the bottom of the landfill can be lined, synthetically or with soil, to prevent water contamination. Secondly, there must be formal engineering preparations and plannings in order to ensure the success of the landfill. Thirdly, permanent supervision must be present in all stages of the landfill also to ensure success and sustainability. Lastly, the placement and compacting of waste must be planned to prevent pest and vermin infestations.

In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the aerobic degradation of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption. It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner. This enables reduced costs of disposal if  landfill  is charged on a cost per tonne basis.  Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for  refuse-derived fuel s. Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not stabilised. Biodried waste will still break down in a landfill to produce  landfill gas  and hence potentially contribute to climate change. In the UK this waste will still impact upon councils  LATS  allowances. Whilst biodrying is increasingly applied within commercial  mechanical biological treatment  (MBT) plants, it is also still subject to on-going research and development.

It begins with the waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can affect the quality of final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can make it more difficult to separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside where the product can become wet can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material. Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.
95_3	MARCO_2042115	There are two wide spread myths about compaction: 1) Freeze-thaw cycles will alleviate a majority of soil compaction created by machinery, and 2) What compaction Mother Nature does not take care of, deep tillage or subsoiling will alleviate.
95_3	MARCO_2857373	Sometimes this waste can build up to harmful levels. Examples of human waste that can affect ecosystems are: household waste. industrial waste. agricultural waste. gases produced when fossil fuels are burned. Humans sometimes harvest plants and animals from natural ecosystems and this can also unbalance them. For example, harvesting timber can lead to soil erosion and loss of habitat, while harvesting fish from the oceans can cause species to become threatened and unbalance food webs.

95_3	MARCO_8140500	Solid waste is materials that can not be decomposed. Hazardous waste is toxic material that can do harm to living beings and the environment. Describe the difference between an open dump, a sanitary landfill and a modern, secure, hazardous waste disposal site. Open dumps do not regulate what goes into their dumps. Chemicals and other liquids are able to run to the ground water. Sanitary landfills are disposal sites for non-hazardous solid waste that is spread in layers and compacted to the smallest practical volume. The sites are typically designed with floors made of materials to treat seeping liquids and are covered by soil as the wastes are compacted and deposited into the landfill.
95_3	MARCO_8242820	Many products that are biodegradable in soil â such as tree trimmings, food wastes and paper â will not biodegrade when we place them in landfills, because the artificial landfill environment lacks the light, water and bacterial activity required for the decay process to begin.
95_3	MARCO_847309	The key part of landfill design is the bottom liner on top of which the solid waste is piled and compressed. The liner is made of a rugged puncture resistant material like high-density polyethylene. The liner is also surrounded by compacted clay soil, geo-fabrics, and other layers of protection. There are two ways for liquid to enter into the landfill. One is in the trash itself. Landfills regulate the moisture content that is allowed when dumping solid waste. Slump tests and paint filter tests are used to measure moisture contents. Rainwater also can soak into the landfill and will result in leachate that must be treated. It is important to keep the landfill as dry as possible to reduce the amount of leachate. Surface run-off is collected using ditches and catch basins and is diverted away from the covered landfill cells. The ditches are either concrete or gravel-lined and carry water to collection ponds. In the collection ponds, suspended soil

The project was controversial as the first of its kind to be proposed in Australia.  The only other similar plant in existence is in Singapore which recycles 1% sewage water.  The Water Futures project proposed recycling 25-29% for potable use.

If collected using a separate plumbing system from blackwater, domestic greywater can be  recycled  directly within the home, garden or company and used either immediately or processed and stored. If stored, it must be used within a very short time or it will begin to putrefy due to the organic solids in the water. Recycled greywater of this kind is never  safe to drink , but a number of treatment steps can be used to provide water for washing or flushing toilets.

Challenges to increased levels of recycling include capital needed to build digesters, the complexity of complying with health regulations, and avoiding neighbors who object to unpleasant smells. There are also new forms of contaminants in urban sewage systems which make the process of producing high quality biosolids more complex. These have led some municipalities to ban biosolids on farms and even in forests.

However, experts have found that sewage treatment does not remove these chemicals completely from drinking supplies.In response to this, the  water industry  has stated that there is no evidence of a risk to overall health as a result of exposure to these chemicals. The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  states in its review of water pollution that many contaminants survive wastewater treatment and  biodegradation , and are detectable in the environment. Therefore, the tainted source is recycled through a community, exposing more people and releasing more chemicals along the way.

Various processes have been developed to extract phosphorus from sewage sludge directly, from the ash after  incineration  of the sewage sludge or from other products of  sewage sludge treatment . This includes the extraction of phosphorus rich materials such as  struvite  from waste processing plants. The struvite can be made by adding magnesium to the waste. Some companies such as Ostara in Canada and NuReSys in Belgium are already using this technique to recover phosphate. Ostara has eight operating plants worldwide.

95_4	CAR_2c7c104120977474ecb01a1ad5074d11e2b023c0	Greywater  is  wastewater  generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and  constructed wetland s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated  sewage  or  blackwater  to indicate it contains  human waste . Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.
95_4	CAR_326ea66fc7256ff96a9490b8df988793b347a3b1	The term biosolids is used to differentiate treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.

Israel treats 80% of its sewage (400 billion liters a year), and 100% of the sewage from the Tel Aviv metropolitan area is treated and reused as irrigation water for agriculture and public works. The remaining sludge is currently pumped into the Mediterranean, however a new bill has passed stating a conversion to treating the sludge to be used as manure.Only 20% of the treated water is lost (due to evaporation, leaks, overflows and seeping). The recycled water allows farmers to plan ahead and not be limited by water shortages.There are many levels of treatment, and many different ways of treating the water—which leads to a big difference in the quality of the end product. The best quality of reclaimed sewage water comes from adding a gravitational filtering step, after the chemical and biological cleansing. This method uses small ponds in which the water seeps through the sand into the aquifer in about 400 days, then is pumped out as clear purified water. This is nearly the same process used in the space station water recycling system, which turns urine and feces into purified drinking water, oxygen and manure.

Portholes are located in public areas and on private property where the owner has opted in. The waste is then pulled through an underground pipeline by air pressure difference created by large industrial fans, in response to porthole sensors that indicate when the trash needs to be emptied and help ensure that only one kind of waste material is travelling through the pipe at a time. The pipelines converge on a central processing facility that uses automated software to direct the waste to the proper container, from there to be trucked to its final location, such as a landfill or composting plant.

Use of these cities' waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost. When obtained, the materials may be recycled over and over in the own city/community, using the  cradle to cradle design  method. Locations where waste can be found include  landfill s,  junkyards , on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways. Organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages. Also, town districts and other places (e.g.  cemeteries ) that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for gathering materials as stone, concrete, or potassium.
95_4	CAR_6a36e4d926f0a4adbfa1161479e2ed9c8f32e9a4	Standards are set for sewage sludge generated or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs are referred to as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.

It is the first system able to process Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in continuous mode. The Plant is able to process up to 40.000 tons per year without previous selection, and the system has been internationally patented by ECOHISPÁNICA. The process just applies water steam, pressure, temperature, and some internal movement... In about 20 minutes, the main part of the garbage (organic matter), is converted into a kind of biomass, very clean, that you can touch with your hands, storable, and valid for composting, for gassification, or power generation (the calorific power is about 3.500 kcal/kg). The rest of materials like plastic or metals, are very easy to select once garbage has been processed into the Waste Cleaner. The advantages of this technology are really impressive: It makes possible the goal of zero landfill, the volume of the garbage is reduced more than 80%, the operational costs are significantly reduced, no emissions,the employees work in very clean conditions, it increases a lot the efficiency in respect to other technologies,and is very fast (20 minutes are enough).

At first, most of these would have to be imported from the moon, asteroids, or the Earth. After that, recycling should reduce the need for imports. One proposed recycling method would start by burning the cryogenic distillate, plants, garbage and sewage with air in an electric arc, and distilling the result. The resulting carbon dioxide and water would be immediately usable in agriculture. The nitrates and salts in the ash could be dissolved in water and separated into pure minerals. Most of the nitrates, potassium and sodium salts would effectively recycle as fertilizers. Other minerals containing iron, nickel, and silicon could be chemically purified in batches and reused industrially. The small fraction of remaining materials, well below 0.01% by weight, could be processed into pure elements with zero-gravity  mass spectrometry , and added in appropriate amounts to the fertilizers and industrial stocks.

By overlaying art, public access, sewage treatment, habitat restorations, and agriculture, she embedded major urban infrastructure within living nature. Her design has been credited with "re-inventing art and reforming civil engineering". The project includes natural systems to treat sewage, allowing millions of gallons of water to be reused. Johanson used the form of the endangered  Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse  to create the shapes of the polishing ponds, which contain islands that direct the flow of water and provide nesting habitat for birds. Other plantings support local wildlife. An additional  area of tidal wetlands was acquired for the park and wildlife sanctuary. This multi-purpose landscape provides more than  of walking trails for educational programs, nature study and tourism. Petaluma Wetlands Park coincides with a $150 million sewage treatment facility, while also serving as a highly visible model for converting sewage into recycled water, which is stored in a deep reservoir at the end of the "mouse's tail".

Waste management is collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage, sewage and other waste products. Waste management is the process of treating solid wastes and offers variety of solutions for recycling items that donât belong to trash. It is about how garbage can be used as a valuable resource. Waste management is something that each and every household and business owner in the world needs.

95_4	MARCO_8790786	The difference between waste management and recycling can be clearly stated. Waste management refers to the actual collection, transporting, and processing of waste, while recycling is a process that turns waste into reusable materials. To make the difference between recycling and waste management even clearer, it is important to first understand the process of waste management. In the sense of waste management, waste refers to human waste. This type of waste can be in solid, liquid, gaseous, or radioactive form. Each type of waste is transported, collected, and processed in a different manner. Each country has a unique way of handling waste.

95_5	CAR_0506038b0a8f364a9cbb499399f1cbe8c1f5f75b		It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste.	Some claim that the key component to zero waste is  recycling  while others reject that notion in favor of reusing high function. The common understanding of recycling is simply that of placing bottles and cans in a recycle bin. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example, a 2007 report by the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  states that the US recycles at a national rate of 33.4% and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition many worldwide commodity industries have been created to handle the materials that are recycled. At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of  soil  and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the "recycled" column. In states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to pump up the recycling rate figures.	 The movement toward recycling has separated itself from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the  computer industry  where worldwide millions of PC's are disposed of as  electronic waste  each year (160 million in 2007). Those computers that enter the recycling stream are broken down into a small amount of  raw materials  while most merely enter dumps through export to  third world countries . Companies are then able to purchase some raw materials, notably  steel ,  copper  and  glass , reducing the use of new materials. On the other hand, there is an industry, more aligned with the Zero Waste principle of design for long term reuse, that actually repairs computers. It is called the  Computer Refurbishing  industry and it predates the current campaign to just collect and ship electronics. They have organizations and conferences and have for many years donated computers to schools, clinics and non-profits. Zero Waste planning demands that components be redesigned for effective reuse over long lives leading to even more refurbishing and repair.	There is one seminal example that brings out the difference between Zero Waste and recycling in stark relief. That example, quoted in Getting To Zero Waste, is the software business. Zero Waste is sensitive to the waste of intellectual effort that would be caused by the need to recreate certain basic inventions of software (called objects in software design) as opposed to copying them over and over whenever needed. The waste would occur as the software developers consume resources while solving problems already solved earlier. The application of Zero Waste analysis is straightforward as it recommends conserving human effort. On the other hand, the usual approach of recycling would be to look for some materials that could be found to reuse. The materials on which software is saved (such as paper or diskettes)is of little significance compared to the saving of human effort and if software is saved electronically, there is no media at all. Thus Zero Waste correctly identifies a wasteful behavior to avoid while recycling has no application.	The recycling movement has been embraced by the garbage industry because it serves so well as greenwashing i.e. a way to show that design for garbage creation is acceptable because materials will be kept out of a dump by recycling them. Zero Waste, on the other hand, offers the garbage industry no such screen against public condemnation of waste, and therefore actually threatens the continued need for garbage disposal. For example, in  Alameda County, California , garbage dumping is charged a surcharge of $8/ton (as of 2009) which goes entirely for a recycling subsidy but none of which goes for any kind of Zero Waste style designing. Zero Waste has received no support from the garbage industry or politicians under their control except in those cases where it can be claimed to consist solely of more recycling.

The term was first used in a 1994 book by Joseph Jenkins that advocates the use of this  organic  soil amendment. The term humanure is used by compost enthusiasts in the US but not generally elsewhere. Because the term "humanure" has no authoritative definition it is subject to various uses; news reporters occasionally fail to correctly distinguish between humanure and  sewage sludge  or "biosolids".

95_5	CAR_2c7c104120977474ecb01a1ad5074d11e2b023c0	Greywater  is  wastewater  generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and  constructed wetland s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated  sewage  or  blackwater  to indicate it contains  human waste . Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.

Composting is one of the only ways to revitalize soil vitality due to  phosphorus  depletion in soil. Industrial scale composting in the form of  in-vessel composting ,  aerated static pile composting , and anaerobic digestion takes place in most Western countries now, and in many areas is mandated by law. There are process and product guidelines in Europe that date to the early 1980s (Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland) and only more recently in the UK and the US. In both these countries, private trade associations within the industry have established loose standards, some say as a stop-gap measure to discourage independent government agencies from establishing tougher consumer-friendly standards. The USA is the only Western country that does not distinguish sludge-source compost from green-composts, and by default in the USA 50% of states expect composts to comply in some manner with the federal EPA 503 rule promulgated in 1984 for sludge products. Compost is regulated in Canada and Australia as well.

95_5	CAR_36ea5c0edc55d96bdbc9476778d106f0f866bee9	Indeed, as late as 2006, the City of Oakland offered incentives for businesses to haul garbage to a landfill, rather than consider reuse and recycling options. Additionally, Oakland recognized in 2006 that a lack of  service provider s for recycling and recovery efforts had prevented progress toward environmentally sustainable solutions. Also, the City had never set aside land needed for reuse and recycling business materials. In this way, incentives and the marketplace were working against the City’s environmental concerns. In fact, most product consumption serves to undermine a Zero Waste Policy because of the inherent negative “externalities,” or those factors outside the market transaction, which are not accounting for in the cost of producing and consuming an item. Historically, prices for  toy s,  watch es,  car s, etc., have not covered the costs associated with disposing or recycling these items. Oakland will remedy this flaw in the system by working toward shifting the responsibility of material disposal to the manufacturer instead of the government or the consumer. Further, rather than apply the  tax base  toward cleanup of contaminated landfills, the Zero Waste system will use the tax base to invest in recycling, composting and reuse facilities, called “Resource Recovery Parks.”

Instead the building washrooms were fitted with   composting toilets   that allowed waste to fall  down through a stainless steel chutes into composting bins located in the basement of the building.  Urine filtering through the compost medium forms a leachate, which initially was drained and combined with drainage from the lavatories and released into a linear bioswayle or "greywater trench", designed by the landscape architect and the mechanical engineer.  The concept was to enable the plants in the greywater trench to benefit from the nutrients contained in the leachate, and eventually allow the finished compost to be used within the landscaped areas surrounding the building.  However, samples collected of the leachate and finished compost in 2011 revealed these materials did not meet the provincial regulatory environmental and health & safety standards.  Consequently, the leachate is now being drained to sewer and the compost product is being disposed of to a sanitary landfill.  The university is currently considering options to either replace the composting system with a conventional plumbing and toilet system, or another alternate system such as a water reclamation and recycle process.

Most greenhouse gases attributed to waste are the result of energy consumed in lifecycle stages upstream from the landfill (materials extraction, pre-manufacture, manufacture, and transport), not from the landfill itself.  In 2001, San Francisco’s actions to divert materials from Altamont landfill into recycled products reduced greenhouse gas emissions from these upstream lifecycle stages by the equivalent of 768,000 tons of carbon dioxide, vs. manufacturing these same products from virgin materials.  This shift away from virgin materials represents a 75-80% savings in net greenhouse gas emissions for paper, glass, copper, and steel, and a 97.5% savings for aluminum. The recycling of paper has an additional carbon sequestration effect through forest conservation. Diversion of organic material into composting also reduces greenhouse emissions, since applying compost as a soil amendment helps to sequester carbon.  In this vein, San Francisco’s mandatory recycling and composting ordinance supports the city’s 2002 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Resolution to reduce emissions to 20% less than 1990 levels by no later than 2012.

Resource recovery differs from the management of waste by using  life-cycle analysis  (LCA) to offer alternatives to  landfill  disposal of discarded materials. A number of studies on  municipal solid waste  (MSW) have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic waste fraction via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured alternatives to  landfill  disposal.

Tierney also referenced a study conducted by the  Solid Waste Association of North America  (SWANA) that found in the six communities involved in the study, "all but one of the curbside recycling programs, and all the composting operations and  waste-to-energy   incinerator s, increased the cost of waste disposal."

She argued that the cost of waste management could more than double in ten years, and called for greater investment from the federal and provincial governments.  The task force held a series of public meetings, and in June 2001 submitted a report to divert all residential garbage to recycling and composting by 2010.  Disero supported expansions to the  blue box  recycling program in her capacity, and announced the launch of a  green box  program in September 2001.
95_5	CAR_a75b393aaa200a7d84671c2a3e55cdf53d1fce5f	In addition to  waste reduction  and  recycling  strategies, there are various alternatives to landfills, including  waste-to-energy  incineration,  anaerobic digestion ,  composting ,  mechanical biological treatment ,  pyrolysis  and  plasma arc gasification , which have all begun to establish themselves in the market. Depending on local economics and incentives, these can be made more financially attractive than landfills.

Since all biodegradable materials will eventually  oxidise  to become  compost , the process can be undertaken  at home  with no running costs, although equipment can accelerate the process. Most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost, however some exceptions will not (e.g. cooked foods and feces) and can attract  vermin . The effectiveness of composting food waste depends on the available space (or storage capacity in the case of a compost bin) and the  method of composting . Unlike in landfill, where it is mixed with other (non-biodegradable) materials, food waste  decomposing  in a compost does not release harmful gases. Similarly to compost created from other waste sources, composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to the soil if spread on the garden (see  uses of compost ).
95_5	CAR_b3a675a0179130bd7b5d2f8e8a374acff8c8e469	Curbside collection  is the most common method of disposal in most European countries,  Canada ,  New Zealand  and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.In some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America. Pyrolysis  is used for disposal of some wastes including tires, a process that can produce recovered fuels, steel and heat. In some cases tires can provide the feedstock for cement manufacture. Such systems are used in USA, California, Australia, Greece, Mexico, the United Kingdom and in Israel. The RESEM pyrolysis plant that has been operational at   Texas   USA since December 2011, and processes up to 60 tons per day.In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.In  San Francisco , the local government established its Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in support of its goal of zero waste by 2020, requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside "Fantastic 3" bin system – blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials – provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's "Pay-As-You-Throw" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America. Other businesses such as  Waste Industries  use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.

Recycling reduces the use of raw materials, the creation and use of energy and pollution (air, water and land). Recycling is maintained and run through drop-offs for various materials, buy back centers, curbside collection areas, etc. All of these are done in addition to landfill waste; for instance, there may be a recycling bin next to a garbage can.

The most common method of human waste treatment in rural areas where municipal sewage systems are unavailable is the use of  septic tank  systems. In remote rural places without sewage or septic systems, small populations allow for the continued use of  honey bucket s and sewage lagoons (see  anaerobic lagoon ) without the threat of disease presented by places with denser populations. Honey buckets are used by rural villages in  Alaska  where, due to  permafrost , conventional waste treatment systems cannot be utilized.
95_5	CAR_cd44167b92976ba9f7a0fcef5e64eee21c4377a3	Recycling , a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community  composting . An offshoot of recycling,  upcycling , strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life. By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.

In the case of landfills,  advanced countries  typically have rigid protocols for  daily cover  with topsoil, where  underdeveloped countries  customarily rely upon less stringent protocols.  The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of  pathogen s. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of  leachate  that could contaminate  groundwater  (and hence jeopardize some  drinking water  supplies).

To conserve its limited space, in 1987, Zanker installed the first permeant  concrete recycling  operation in the  United States . In 1988, Zanker invented a demolition recycling operation, utilizing water that separated   demolition waste  into  soil ,  concrete , metals, and wood. Ten years later, Zanker designed and constructed a  demolition  debris recycling operation that processed unsorted demolition debris materials at the rate of 70 tons per hour. The processing operation was known as "the rocket", which was constructed at Zanker's newly permitted facility adjacent to its first site. In the same year, Zanker began the operation of a  construction  and demolition (C&D) debris sorting operation. In 1998, Zanker also permitted and constructed the Z-Best Composting Facility, located in  Gilroy, California . In 2005, the company saw a different type of material that could not be processed through the older demolition recycling operation. This material was referred to as interior demolition. This material is derived from the demolition of concrete tilt-up buildings, common in the  Silicon Valley .

In 2007, more than 96% of cans available in the market were recycled. This leadership comes from informal waste scavengers that make their living by collecting aluminum cans. However, recycling in general in Brazil is low. Brazil produces 240 thousand tons of waste every day. Out of this amount, only 2% is recycled with the remainder dumped in landfills. In 1992, private companies in Brazil established the Brazilian Business Commitment for Recycling (CEMPRE), a nonprofit organization that promotes recycling and waste elimination. The organization issues publications, conducts technical research, holds seminars and maintains databases. Nevertheless, only 62% of the population has access to the garbage collection. Even within these collection systems, the collection of recyclable material is not common. The success of informal waste pickers provided evidence to lawmakers and citizens that solutions that are low tech, low cost, and labor-intensive can provide sustainable solutions to waste management while also providing social and economic benefits.
95_5	CAR_e41f111e8bb06904a4ee4cb5508c554c5242aa8b	There were a number of other San Francisco waste reduction policies passed during this time and most of them focus on city government operations. For example, the Mayor's Executive Order on Bottled Water bans the purchase of bottled water with city funds while the Precautionary Purchasing Ordinance, "requires city departments to purchase products that maximize post-consumer recycled content and recyclable or compostable materials, and that favor durability, repairability, and reuse." All of the aforementioned policies have had  large impacts on diversion rates and by the end of 2007, the City had reached 72 percent. However, it was clear that increased participation in the residential curbside collection program was desirable if San Francisco were to reach zero waste by 2020. According to Jack Macy, Commercial Zero Waste Coordinator for the City of San Francisco, if everyone in San Francisco participated in the program by separating all the materials accepted, a 90 percent diversion rate would be achievable. San Francisco realized that voluntary participation would not suffice, and in 2009, the Board of Supervisors passed the Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance, requiring all persons in San Francisco to separate their recyclables, compostables and landfilled trash and to participate in recycling and composting programs.
95_5	CAR_e68b5382285afcb9dc076706d1513e548354e937	In most of  Europe , garbage disposers are not used at all; the high load of organic matter in the  waste water  requires a higher capacity sewage treatment plant, since the increased organic matter requires additional oxygen and water to process. Instead, garbage is separated at the source, into  compostable  and other types of garbage and collected. Similarly, in the  United States  there have been some political and  environmental issues  with garbage disposers. For many years,  New York City  had  ban ned their use. The stated reason was the above-mentioned increased sewage treatment capacity, but many area residents also suspected that it was the garbage  unions  not wanting work taken away from them. The ban was rescinded on September 11, 1997.

The first is to treat the  raw water  drawn from the  Schuylkill  and  Delaware River s so that it is safe for drinking, and deliver it to customers. The second is to collect and treat  wastewater  (i.e.,  sewage ) that flows into the  sewer system . Philadelphia Water must treat this used water coming from homes, businesses and factories, as well as  rainwater , so that it is clean enough to return to the Delaware River. The department is also responsible for collecting, storing and managing  stormwater  in order to keep excess stormwater from overflowing into the  wastewater treatment system .The third is to collect and recycle  biosolids  into clean, beneficial soil-like  compost . Biosolids are the solid materials left over from the wastewater treatment process, including plant material, human waste, food put down the garbage disposal and detergents. The Biosolids Recycling Center cleans, treats and transforms these materials into a nutrient-rich compost.

As of the same year, it outsourced its vermicompost production to worm farmers in  North Carolina .From 2012, TerraCycle and various  tobacco  companies partnered to launch a widespread collection and recycling system for  cigarette butts . The cigarette butt filters, generally made from  cellulose acetate , are refined into pellets that are then used in the production of plastic items such as shipping pallets, benches, and ashtrays. The company promises that the recycled plastic from cigarette filters will only be used in industrial products and not in household plastics due to its exposure to  nicotine . The recycled cellulose acetate is mixed with other recycled plastics to create usable industrial products. Tobacco and paper are composted in this program. It took six months for the development of the cigarette butt recycling solution.

Composting is an alternative technology to others that are not always respectful of natural resources and environment and also have a high cost. In Jundiz they use an inndustrial composting systems that are increasingly being installed as a waste management alternative to landfills, along with other advanced waste processing systems. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with  anaerobic digestion  or in-vessel composting, is called mechanical biological treatment, increasingly used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating biodegradable waste before it enters a landfill reduces global warming from fugitive  methane ; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing  landfill gas  that contains  methane , a potent greenhouse gas.

95_5	MARCO_6177827	A composting toilet is a miniature ecosystem designed to recycle human excrement safely by containing it while microorganisms convert it to humus. Returning that humus to the soil is one important ecological benefit. Another benefit of composting toilets is that they use little or no water.
95_5	MARCO_6936470	The amount of water mixed with human waste can be reduced by the use of waterless urinals and composting toilets and by recycling greywater. The most common method of human waste treatment in rural areas where municipal sewage systems are unavailable is the use of septic tank systems.he term human waste is used in the general media to mean several things, such as sewage, sewage sludge, blackwater-in fact anything that may contain some human feces.
95_5	MARCO_7062181	If recycling isnât an option, composting is. Grease is generally not a good thing in a compost pile, because it can attract rodents and result in a bad smell. The small amounts found as residue on the cardboard boxes, though, might be okay in your backyard composting pile.
95_5	MARCO_715351	Composting provides a way not only of reducing the amount of waste that needs to be disposed of, but also of converting it into a product that is useful for gardening, landscaping, or house plants.
95_5	MARCO_715355	There are a number of reasons. Composting provides a partial solution to an issue of great concern in many communities. All around the country, landfills are filling up, garbage incineration is becoming increasingly unpopular, and other waste disposal options are becoming ever harder to find.
95_5	MARCO_7408832	Paper is compostable and recyclable. Composing and recycling are two environmentally sound methods of handling waste. Using either approach to waste management keeps materials out of landfills and minimizes your environmental impact.
95_5	MARCO_7944653	The good news is that there are some easy guidelines to follow. Soon you will be able to handle the line of garbage bins at your front door like a recycling pro. Germany produces 30 million tons of garbage annually. The Green Dot system has been one of the most successful recycling initiatives, which has literally put packaging on a diet. The crux is that manufacturers and retailers have to pay for a Green Dot on products: the more packaging there is, the higher the fee.
95_5	MARCO_7996572	Waste items can be an economically viable resource if channelled in the right way through the right business mechanism, and can be used to beneficiate the economy. Also, there is less negative environmental impact if waste isnât disposed of at landfill (landfills generate methane, a potent greenhouse gas).he waste minimisation and recycling industry has the potential to offer space for new and diverse businesses which use waste as an input. In addition, the man on the street may end up saving money if he recycles (especially the case with businesses, complexes etc.).
95_5	MARCO_8033009	Waste management is collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage, sewage and other waste products. Waste management is the process of treating solid wastes and offers variety of solutions for recycling items that donât belong to trash.
95_5	MARCO_8426836	Composting is the natural process of decomposition and recycling of organic material into a humus rich soil amendment known as compost. For any business or institution producing food waste, this organic material can be easily decomposed into high quality compost.
95_5	MARCO_845338	Biodegradable packing peanuts are made from natural, nontoxic sources, such as wheat and corn starch. They dissolve in water and can be thrown into compost piles after a single use. In addition, biodegradable foam peanuts do not have an electrostatic charge, meaning they will not stick to clothes.ere, we will examine the pros and cons of biodegradable peanuts. Pros: Composed of polystyrene, a plastic polymer better known as Styrofoam, traditional loose fill packing peanuts are difficult to decompose. After disposal, they can end up in a landfill or floating around the ocean for many, many years.

95_5	MARCO_8790791	Difference between Composting and Recycling Waste Waste management via recycling and composting is the in thing these days in almost all parts of the world. How can London be left behind. However there are people who canât draw a fine line between composting and recycling.
95_5	MARCO_92930	Recycling saves landfill space, conserves resource, saves energy and saves water. Recycling is only the tip of the environmental ice burg; reducing your waste and reusing what you have will always be better. However, you may be surprised how much of an impact recycling really has.
95_5	MARCO_95106	Composting is free, easy, and one of the best things you can do for the environment, next to cutting down on fossil fuel consumption and minding your three Râs â reducing, reusing, recycling. Call me juvenile, but I also feel like Iâm somehow getting away with something.
95_5	MARCO_986288	Composting is a low-cost, effective and natural way of recycling organic materials, and it is included in sustainable agriculture and recommended for organic agriculture (Peigne, Girardin 2004).
95_6	CAR_00c3a48bf312d46684d9d10ceb9eec44e6903963	Under  low oxygen  conditions biodegradable plastics break down slower and with the production of  methane , like other organic materials do. The breakdown process is accelerated in a dedicated  compost heap . Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home compost bin, while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures. Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone. Nevertheless, it takes many months.In 2016, a bacterium named  Ideonella sakaiensis  was found to biodegrade  PET .
95_6	CAR_092c3791d813781d792049afb3ca255a5818ea5e	PBAT is marketed commercially as a fully  biodegradable plastic , with BASF's Ecoflex showing 90% degradation after 80 days in testing.   Particular applications that are highlighted by the manufacturers include  cling wrap  for food packaging, compostable  plastic bags  for gardening and agricultural use, and as water resistant coatings for other materials, as in  paper cups .   Due to its high flexibility and biodegradable nature, PBAT is also marketed as an additive for more rigid biodegradable plastics to impart flexibility while still maintain full biodegradability of the final blend.
95_6	CAR_0b3b5af47f4ec674245a6a328d826a7fbb60a09c	Biodegradable polymers can be melt processed by conventional means such as compression or  injection molding . Special consideration must be given to the need to exclude moisture from the material. Care must be taken to dry the polymers before processing to exclude humidity. As most biodegradable polymers have been synthesized by ring opening polymerization, a thermodynamic equilibrium exists between the forward polymerization reaction and the reverse reaction that results in monomer formation. Care needs to be taken to avoid an excessively high processing temperature that may result in monomer formation during the molding and extrusion process. It must be followed carefully
95_6	CAR_126827f1790f2869d0a345291e9d5f02fe51a45c	The most commonly used material for punched pockets is  polypropylene . However, there are some punched pockets made of  polyethylene ,  cellophane , or other plastics. These may include, recycled and biodegradable plastics (as defined by ASTM D5511) as well as plastics with antimicrobial additives.  The clarity of the plastic will vary with the thickness of the pocket due to the  semicrystalline  nature of the polymers and  Light scattering by particles .  Typically, biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) is used to improve clarity of punched pockets.  Using the customary unit of plastic thickness, the  mil , punched pockets are produced in various thicknesses for different uses, and may or may not cover both sides of the document completely.  The thinnest pockets may be less than 2 mil, while the thickest are over 4 mil.  
95_6	CAR_14212940c94625022a016b626bce866bfdbe62d4	OXO-bio plastics, especially in the form of plastic bags, are now used in many places as a solution to the problem of plastic litter in the open environment.  They are mandatory in some areas of the Middle-East, Asia and Africa.  OXO-biodegradable plastics contain metal salts used as the catalyst for OXO-biodegradation. These carry no risks of environmental pollution as they do not contain heavy metals (see EU Packaging Waste Directive 94/62 Art 11) but rather transition metals such as iron, cobalt, manganese or nickel.  
95_6	CAR_16259b56cf6d7607da6d3643f4e0ef51053a7467	If conventional plastics (e.g. PE) are used as mulch films, they are likely to  accumulate  in soil, since the removal and the correct disposal of these plastics are technically and economically burdensome. This accumulation could cause both  crop yield  reduction and  environmental problems . Biodegradable polymer s are polymers that can be degraded by the naturally occurring microbial community in an environmental system. They provide a more sustainable alternative to conventionally used plastics for mulch films. Providing the same benefits as detailed above, the problem of plastic accumulation in soils could be solved. Aliphatic polyesters and aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters have shown to be promising groups of biodegradable polymers.
95_6	CAR_19601058a58d5c2e89639243c8453dd04ddc966e	The use of  biodegradable plastics  has been shown to have many  advantages and disadvantages . Biodegradables are  biopolymers  that degrade in industrial  compost ers. Biodegradables do not degrade as efficiently in domestic composters, and during this slower process,  methane gas  may be emitted.
95_6	CAR_1d5c9fefc722e92b9e3e7d68cc81e21aa1c41e08	Oxo-biodegradable  plastic bags have the same strength as ordinary plastic and cost very little extra. They will degrade then biodegrade if they get into the open environment, but they can be recycled if collected during their useful life. They are designed so that they will not degrade deep in landfill and will not therefore generate methane. Oxo-biodegradable plastic does not degrade quickly in low temperature "windrow" composting, but it is suitable for "in-vessel" composting at the higher temperatures required by the animal by-products regulations. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is  bio-assimilated  by the same bacteria and fungi, which transform natural material such as twigs and leaves to cell  biomass , like lignocellulosic materials. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is designed to degrade initially by a process which includes both photo-oxidation and thermo-oxidation, so it can degrade in the dark.  Resin identification code  7 is applicable to biodegradable plastics.
95_6	CAR_252153d959e161cd3c9b1ba708e94355ed922157	In addition to medicine, biodegradable polymers are often used to reduce the volume of waste in packaging materials. There is also significant effort to replace materials derived from petrochemicals with those that can be made from biodegradable components. One of the most commonly used polymers for packaging purposes is  polylactic acid , PLA. The production of PLA has several advantages, the most important of which is the ability to tailor the physical properties of the polymer through processing methods. PLA is used for a variety of films, wrappings, and containers (including bottles and cups). In 2002, FDA ruled that PLA was safe to use in all food packaging. BASF markets a product called Ecovio® which is a blend of the company's biodegradable plastic Ecoflex® and PLA. An application for this biodegradable material is for thin plastic films such as shopping bags or trash bags.
95_6	CAR_2ce21473879af4cd72c4fbe19d453ff5bcc59aae	Landfill  areas contain many different types of plastics. In these landfills, there are many  microorganism s which speed up the biodegradation of plastics. The microorganisms include bacteria such as  Pseudomonas ,  nylon-eating bacteria , and  Flavobacteria . These bacteria break down nylon through the activity of the  nylonase  enzyme. When  biodegradable plastic s are broken down,  methane  is released, which is a very powerful  greenhouse gas  that contributes significantly to  global warming .
95_6	CAR_38db4ab9e08d1ed7b38bc3a12082cebda4050021	OXO-bio plastic is conventional polyolefin plastic to which has been added small amounts of metal salts, none of which are "heavy metals" which are restricted by the EU Packaging Waste Directive 94/62 Art 11. These salts catalyze the degradation process to speed it up so that the OXO plastic will degrade abiotically at the end of its useful life in the presence of oxygen much more quickly than ordinary plastic.  At the end of that process it is no longer visible, it is no longer a plastic as it has been converted via  Carboxylation  or  Hydroxylation  to small-chain organic chemicals which will then biodegrade. It does not therefore leave fragments of plastic in the environment. The degradation process is shortened from decades to years and/or months for abiotic degradation and thereafter the rate of  biodegradation  depends on the micro-organisms in the environment.  It does not however need to be in a highly microbial environment such as compost. Timescale for complete biodegradation is much shorter than for "conventional"  plastic s which, in normal environments, are very slow to biodegrade and cause  large scale harm . 
95_6	CAR_3c98982c7f8f38176454a881accf2a0f9a8250a4	On the other hand, composting of these mixed organics (food scraps, yard trimmings, and wet, non-recyclable paper) is a potential strategy for recovering large quantities of waste and dramatically increasing community recycling goals. Food scraps and wet, non-recyclable paper comprise 50 million tons of  municipal solid waste .  Biodegradable plastics can replace the non-degradable plastics in these waste streams, making municipal composting a significant tool to divert large amounts of otherwise nonrecoverable waste from landfills.
95_6	CAR_40d663c457fafd71dee833218598f41682a57f55	The trade associations for the  compostable plastics  industry are the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI),  "European Bioplastics," and SPIBioplastics Council. Plastics are certified as compostable for industrial composting conditions in the United States if they comply with ASTM D6400, and in Europe with the EN13432.
95_6	CAR_4105199c9c4928747eafdcbdfb71e59ff1b60f3e	Biodegradable plastics are  plastic s that are decomposed by the action of living organisms, usually bacteria.
95_6	CAR_4cd1856fbe9418e7798e60feff678cac7c8cdf05	Biodegradable polymers are of significant interest to a variety of fields including medicine, agriculture, and packaging. One of the most active areas of research in biodegradable polymer is in controlled drug delivery and release.
95_6	CAR_641ec0834bb860a7ec1e8d647bce91a4bd9377c6	Two basic classes of biodegradable plastics exist:  Bioplastic s, whose components are derived from renewable raw materials, and plastics made from  petrochemical s containing  biodegradable additives  which enhance biodegradation.
95_6	CAR_6891e9bb2e16da56d8cc1acd12f8cb009da2928f	Biodegradable polymers are a specific type of  polymer  that  breaks down  after its intended purpose to result in natural byproducts such as gases ( CO ,  N) ,  water ,  biomass , and inorganic salts.  These polymers are found both naturally and  synthetically  made, and largely consist of  ester ,  amide , and  ether  functional groups. Their properties and breakdown mechanism are determined by their exact structure. These polymers are often synthesized by  condensation reaction s,  ring opening polymerization , and  metal catalysts . There are vast examples and applications of biodegradable polymers.
95_6	CAR_7a264f3642906c62492e38449fa0c998fd709510	The terminology used in the bioplastics sector is sometimes misleading. Most in the industry use the term bioplastic to mean a plastic produced from a biological source. All (bio- and petroleum-based) plastics are technically  biodegradable , meaning they can be degraded by microbes under suitable conditions. However, many degrade so slowly that they are considered non-biodegradable. Some petrochemical-based plastics are considered biodegradable, and may be used as an additive to improve the performance of commercial bioplastics. Non-biodegradable bioplastics are referred to as durable. The biodegradability of bioplastics depends on temperature, polymer stability, and available oxygen content. The European standard EN13432, published by the  International Organization for Standardization , defines how quickly and to what extent a plastic must be degraded under the tightly controlled and aggressive conditions (at or above 140 °F) of an  industrial composting  unit for it to be considered biodegradable. This standard is recognized in many countries, including all of Europe, Japan and the US. However, it applies only to industrial composting units and does not set out a standard for  home composting . Most bioplastics (e.g. PH) only biodegrade quickly in industrial composting units. These materials do not biodegrade quickly in ordinary compost piles or in the soil/water. Starch-based bioplastics are an exception, and will biodegrade in normal composting conditions.
95_6	CAR_99ce1571eb172a3c5ff55d2ee23527cef82b1c3a	OXO-biodegradable products do not degrade immediately in an open environment because they are stabilized to give the product a useful service-life. They will nevertheless degrade and biodegrade in nature if they are exposed to the environment as litter much quicker than natural waste such as twigs and straw and much more quickly than ordinary plastic.  OXO-bio plastics will degrade indoors, but this is not their purpose.  They are intended to degrade and biodegrade by a synergistic process in the open environment.
95_6	CAR_9a38ddcc7fb3baa42c7d8d22c80b75304b12acc5	"The public looks at biodegradable as something magical," even though the term is mostly meaningless, according to Ramani Narayan, a chemical engineer at Michigan State University in East Lansing, and science consultant to the Biodegradable Plastics Institute. "This is the most used and abused and misused word in our dictionary right now.  Simply calling something biodegradable and not defining in what environment it is going to be biodegradable and in what time period it is going to degrade is very misleading and deceptive."  In the  Great Pacific garbage patch , biodegradable plastics break up into small pieces that can more easily enter the  food chain  by being consumed." 
95_6	CAR_b1cc43cc8e18e937456aa7ec174ddc494fa7fa0f	There is concern that another greenhouse gas,  methane , might be released when any biodegradable material, including truly biodegradable plastics, degrades in an  anaerobic   landfill  environment. Methane production from 594 managed landfill environments is captured and used for energy; some landfills burn this off through a process called flaring to reduce the release of methane into the environment. In the US, most landfilled materials today go into landfills where they capture the methane biogas for use in clean, inexpensive energy. Incinerating non-biodegradable plastics will release carbon dioxide as well. Disposing of non-biodegradable plastics made from natural materials in anaerobic (landfill) environments will result in the plastic lasting for hundreds of years.
95_6	CAR_b3024810839f01ac700e140c76f8495ed5f93519	The term "biodegradable plastic" has also been used by producers of specially modified petrochemical-based plastics that appear to biodegrade. Biodegradable plastic bag manufacturers that have misrepresented their product's biodegradability may now face legal action in the US state of California for the misleading use of the terms biodegradable or compostable. Traditional plastics such as  polyethylene  are degraded by  ultra-violet  (UV) light and oxygen. To prevent this, process manufacturers add stabilising chemicals. However, with the addition of a degradation initiator to the plastic, it is possible to achieve a controlled  UV / oxidation  disintegration process. This type of plastic may be referred to as degradable plastic or oxy-degradable plastic or photodegradable plastic because the process is not initiated by microbial action. While some degradable plastics manufacturers argue that degraded plastic residue will be attacked by microbes, these degradable materials do not meet the requirements of the EN13432 commercial composting standard. The bioplastics industry has widely criticized oxo-biodegradable plastics, which the industry association says do not meet its requirements. Oxo-biodegradable plastics – known as "oxos" – are conventional petroleum-based products with some additives that initiate degradation. The ASTM standard for oxo-biodegradables is called the Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation (ASTM 6954). Both EN 13432 and ASTM 6400 are specifically designed for PLA and Starch based products and should not be used as a guide for oxos.
95_6	CAR_b4ddef93dfa762161265a41a197892ba6323c66f	The concept of synthetic biodegradable plastics and polymers was first introduced in the 1980s. In 1992, an international meeting was called where leaders in biodegradable polymers met to discuss a definition, standard, and testing protocol for biodegradable polymers. Also, oversight organizations such as  American Society for Testing of Materials  (ASTM) and the  International Standards Organization  (ISO) were created.  Large clothing and grocery store chains have been making a push to utilize biodegradable bags in the late 2010s. Biodegradable polymers also received notice from various fields in 2012 when Professor Geoffrey Coates of Cornell University received the  Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award . As of 2013, 5-10% of the  plastic  market focused on biodegradable polymer derived plastics.
95_6	CAR_baa939ccfd9dcaa3ea2f4c1a320c1ba5e989d2e3	BioSphere Plastic is a manufacturer of  biodegradable additives . The company states that their product enhances the biodegradation of synthetic polymers by addition of their technology. It has a capacity at or around 5,800 metric tons a year and has filed for patent protection over their additive worldwide.
95_6	CAR_c4e501b0fe1ea5d86edadec47089669916226db9	Biodegradable plastic s can be biologically degraded by  microorganism s to give lower molecular weight molecules. To degrade properly biodegradable polymers need to be treated like  compost  and not just left in a landfill site where degradation is very difficult due to the lack of oxygen and moisture.
95_6	CAR_ccd0d66f4ee1614665b6b4cd47014880b0b9ce50	Each year hundreds of millions of tons of  plastic s are produced from  petroleum .  Most of these plastics will remain in  landfill s for years to come or  litter  the environment posing significant health risks to animals; however, the average person's lifestyle would be impractical without them (see  Applications ). One solution to this conundrum lies in biodegradable polymers. These polymers have the distinct advantage that over time they will break down. Dr. Geoffrey Coates headed research to create catalysts that can not only efficiently create these biodegradable polymers, but the polymers also incorporate the  greenhouse gas  and  global warming  contributor, CO, and, environmentally present ground- ozone  producer, CO.  These two gases can be found or produced in high concentrations from agricultural waste,  coal , and industrial applications as byproducts. Not only do the catalysts utilize these normally wasted and environmentally unfriendly gases, but they also do it extremely efficiently with high  turnover number s and frequencies in addition to good selectivity. These catalysts have been actively used by  Novomer Inc  to make polycarbonates that can replace the current coating  bisphenol A  (BPA) found in many food and drink packaging. Novomer's analysis shows that if used in all cases, these biodegradable polymer coatings could not only sequester, but also avoid further production of CO in hundreds of millions of metric tons in just a single year.
95_6	CAR_d03eff8f9ab5f2ffd626296486ce95d01bdbd68b	As PBS decomposes naturally into  water  and , it may be a  biodegradable  alternative to some common  plastics . The scope of PBS application fields is still growing and several areas can be identified but it remains difficult to know precisely in which specific object PBS is actually used. First in the  packaging  field, PBS could be processed into  films , bags, or boxes, for both food and  cosmetic  packagings. Other applications of PBS could be found as disposable products such as  tableware  or medical articles. In agriculture, PBS finds interest in the fabrication of  mulching films  or delayed release materials for  pesticide  and  fertilizer . PBS is also promise to find market shares in  fishery  (for fishing nets),  forestery , civil engineering or other fields in which recovery and recycling of materials after use is problematic. In the medical field, PBS could be used as biodegradable drug encapsulation systems, and is also investigated for  implants .
95_6	CAR_d9610f897c12b73c7a4d4243a27a73545b23201c	Bioplastics are  plastic s derived from renewable  biomass  sources, such as  vegetable fats and oils ,  corn starch , or  microbiota . Bioplastic can be made from agricultural  by-product s and also from used  plastic bottle s and other containers using microorganisms. Common plastics, such as  fossil-fuel plastic s (also called petrobased polymers), are derived from  petroleum  or  natural gas . Production of such plastics tends to require more  fossil fuel s and to produce more  greenhouse gases  than the production of biobased polymers (bioplastics). Some, but not all, bioplastics are designed to  biodegrade . Biodegradable bioplastics can break down in either  anaerobic  or  aerobic  environments, depending on how they are manufactured. Bioplastics can be composed of  starch es,  cellulose ,  biopolymer s, and a variety of other materials.
95_6	CAR_da7cbdd6842aa3252c79a9689888840812311c2a	Several studies cited in the lower court's records assert that the removal of plastic bags from retail stores and shops actually increase the use of paper bags, which are worse for the environment from a sustainability point of view.  The Boustead Report documents a life-cycle assessment for  biodegradable plastic , recycled/recyclable paper, and recyclable plastic bags.  The results of the report show that impact from recyclable plastic bags is the least of all of the bags when considering total energy, fossil fuel use, amount of solid waste, greenhouse gas emissions, and freshwater usage.
95_6	CAR_e7dbf2edd0c825a2047aa86fa44aca3d6503e721	OXO-biodegradable plastic degrades in the presence of  oxygen , and the process is accelerated by  UV  and heat.  It can be  recycled  during its useful life with normal plastic.It is not designed to be  compostable  in industrial composting facilities according to ASTM D6400 or EN13432, but it can be composted in an in-vessel process.
95_6	CAR_ec22b9c32c9ddbfe44ba1e05332d976cb657ac58	Compostable plastics combine the utility of plastics (lightweight, resistance, relative low cost) with the ability to completely and fully compost in an industrial compost facility. Rather than worrying about recycling a relatively small quantity of commingled plastics, proponents argue that certified biodegradable plastics can be readily commingled with other organic wastes, thereby enabling composting of a much larger position of nonrecoverable solid waste.  Commercial composting for all mixed organics then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable. More municipalities can divert significant quantities of waste from overburdened landfills since the entire waste stream is now biodegradable and therefore easier to process. This move away from the use of landfills may help alleviate the issue of  plastic pollution .
95_6	CAR_edc8c9017deb08f279deb000a803f46db112c5d5	Biodegradable  plastics break down (degrade) upon exposure to sunlight (e.g.,  ultra-violet radiation ), water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes, wind abrasion, and in some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack are also included as forms of  biodegradation  or  environmental degradation . Some modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface, whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems.  Starch  powder has been mixed with plastic as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily, but it still does not lead to complete breakdown of the plastic. Some researchers have actually  genetically engineered  bacteria that synthesize a completely biodegradable plastic, but this material, such as  Biopol , is expensive at present. Companies have made  biodegradable additives  to enhance the biodegradation of plastics.
95_6	CAR_ee1fa9ab96bd8264da6aa7db109e6280e7184da9	There are numerous reports and studies regarding the negative impacts associated with single-use plastic bags.  A summary of two reports with relevance to this case are provided here.  The first is a staff report to the  Los Angeles Board of Supervisors  on plastic bags which identified several findings including plastic carryout bags being a significant contributor to litter and having detrimental impacts on marine wildlife and the environment.  The report also concluded that biodegradable carryout bags were not a practical solution to the issue as there are no local composting facilities available to process  biodegradable bags .  The final two findings of the report focused on the benefits of reusable bags over plastic as well as paper bags and that the acceleration of the widespread use of reusable bags will lessen the amount of litter from plastic bags.  The second report is a comprehensive compilation of information and literature regarding single-use bags found in the Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) on Single Use and Reusable Bags. The intent of the MEA is to provide a comprehensive reference available to cities and counties that can be used to help in understanding the impacts associated with actions targeted at cutting the use of single-use bags. The MEA reports several findings specific to plastic bags, including that ”nearly 20 billion single-use  high-density polyethylene  (HDPE) plastic grocery bags are used annually in California, and most end up in landfills or as litter. In fact, of the four types of bags considered, plastic bags had the greatest impact on litter.”  The MEA reports that single-use paper bags are recycled more than plastic bags, but considering lifecycles, paper bags contribute to larger greenhouse gas emission, water consumption and ozone production as compared to plastic bags.  In comparing plastic bags to biodegradable bags, the MEA found that biodegradable bags had a higher environmental impact at the manufacturing stage and that biodegradable bags may degrade only under composting conditions and will have similar effects on aesthetics and marine life when littered.
95_6	CAR_f92c396d0235c23bfb355d63780254fe461093fc	There are allegations that " Oxo Biodegradable  (OBD)" plastic bags may release metals, and may require a great deal of time to  degrade in certain circumstances  and that OBD plastics may produce tiny fragments of plastic that do not continue to degrade at any appreciable rate regardless of the environment. The response of the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association (www.biodeg.org) is that OBD plastics do not contain metals. They contain salts of metals, which are not prohibited by legislation and are in fact necessary as trace-elements in the human diet. Oxo-biodegradation of polymer material has been studied in depth at the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. A peer-reviewed report of the work was published in Vol 96 of the journal of Polymer Degradation & Stability (2011) at page 919-928, which shows 91% biodegradation in a soil environment within 24 months, when tested in accordance with ISO 17556.

A few of these polymers undergo decomposition in backyard compost bins or in soil, freshwater, or salt water.ther important biodegradable polymers include copolyesters such as polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polybutylene succinate adipate (PBSA), polycaprolactone (PCL), cellulose derivatives, polyglycolic acid (PGA), and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and related polymers.

95_6	MARCO_5400512	Currently, truly biodegradable plastics are mostly used for eating utensils, food containers, and compostable bags. To make sure youâre getting the real deal, look for products with the Biodegradable Products Institute logo, which means theyâve been certified to comply with strict scientific standards.
95_6	MARCO_5400515	Real biodegradable plastic should be sent to a commercial composting facility, where it will spend its final days being eaten by microbes. But hereâs the catch: In 2007, only 42 communities nationwide offered compost collection. (Seventeen were in California.) And though some biodegradable plastics can be recycled, no curbside recycling program will take them. So before you buy biodegradable plastics, make sure you can help them âgo awayâ the right way.
95_6	MARCO_6170128	Biodegradable Plastics. Biodegradable plastic is plastic that decomposes naturally in the environment. This is achieved when microorganisms in the environment metabolize and break down the structure of biodegradable plastic. The end result is one which is less harmful to the environment than traditional plastics.ith biodegradable plastic, you get a substance made from natural sources that does not contain these chemical fillers, and does not pose the same risk to the environment. The process of making biodegradable plastics begins with the melting down of all the materials.

95_7	CAR_041b509bad756928f6dece029cdf99cf6ebd7f5b	The tension between zero waste, viewed as post-discard total  recycling  of materials only, and zero waste as the reuse of all high level function remains a serious one today. It is probably the defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero-wasters. A signature example is the difference between smashing a  glass bottle  (recovering cheap glass) and  refill ing the bottle (recovering the entire function of the container).	The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry-specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an ultimate model for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non-natural (such as chemicals and  plastics  that are mono-molecular) and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse, while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context.	 Biodegradable plastic  is the most prominent example. One side argues that  biodegradation  of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum, the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built, raw materials are procured, investments are made, machinery is built and used, humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education, housing, food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use, all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest.	Companies moving towards "zero landfill" plants include  Subaru ,  Xerox  and  Anheuser-Busch .
95_7	CAR_14212940c94625022a016b626bce866bfdbe62d4	OXO-bio plastics, especially in the form of plastic bags, are now used in many places as a solution to the problem of plastic litter in the open environment.  They are mandatory in some areas of the Middle-East, Asia and Africa.  OXO-biodegradable plastics contain metal salts used as the catalyst for OXO-biodegradation. These carry no risks of environmental pollution as they do not contain heavy metals (see EU Packaging Waste Directive 94/62 Art 11) but rather transition metals such as iron, cobalt, manganese or nickel.  
95_7	CAR_1c02c7d7d9b33865f79c189dc65c1a4efeb35cec	Some plastics are now referred to as being 'degradable', 'oxy-degradable' or 'UV-degradable'. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent)  oil -based and are not currently certified as 'biodegradable' under the  European Union directive  on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers will break down, and some are suitable for domestic  composting .
95_7	CAR_1d5c9fefc722e92b9e3e7d68cc81e21aa1c41e08	Oxo-biodegradable  plastic bags have the same strength as ordinary plastic and cost very little extra. They will degrade then biodegrade if they get into the open environment, but they can be recycled if collected during their useful life. They are designed so that they will not degrade deep in landfill and will not therefore generate methane. Oxo-biodegradable plastic does not degrade quickly in low temperature "windrow" composting, but it is suitable for "in-vessel" composting at the higher temperatures required by the animal by-products regulations. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is  bio-assimilated  by the same bacteria and fungi, which transform natural material such as twigs and leaves to cell  biomass , like lignocellulosic materials. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is designed to degrade initially by a process which includes both photo-oxidation and thermo-oxidation, so it can degrade in the dark.  Resin identification code  7 is applicable to biodegradable plastics.
95_7	CAR_252153d959e161cd3c9b1ba708e94355ed922157	In addition to medicine, biodegradable polymers are often used to reduce the volume of waste in packaging materials. There is also significant effort to replace materials derived from petrochemicals with those that can be made from biodegradable components. One of the most commonly used polymers for packaging purposes is  polylactic acid , PLA. The production of PLA has several advantages, the most important of which is the ability to tailor the physical properties of the polymer through processing methods. PLA is used for a variety of films, wrappings, and containers (including bottles and cups). In 2002, FDA ruled that PLA was safe to use in all food packaging. BASF markets a product called Ecovio® which is a blend of the company's biodegradable plastic Ecoflex® and PLA. An application for this biodegradable material is for thin plastic films such as shopping bags or trash bags.
95_7	CAR_38db4ab9e08d1ed7b38bc3a12082cebda4050021	OXO-bio plastic is conventional polyolefin plastic to which has been added small amounts of metal salts, none of which are "heavy metals" which are restricted by the EU Packaging Waste Directive 94/62 Art 11. These salts catalyze the degradation process to speed it up so that the OXO plastic will degrade abiotically at the end of its useful life in the presence of oxygen much more quickly than ordinary plastic.  At the end of that process it is no longer visible, it is no longer a plastic as it has been converted via  Carboxylation  or  Hydroxylation  to small-chain organic chemicals which will then biodegrade. It does not therefore leave fragments of plastic in the environment. The degradation process is shortened from decades to years and/or months for abiotic degradation and thereafter the rate of  biodegradation  depends on the micro-organisms in the environment.  It does not however need to be in a highly microbial environment such as compost. Timescale for complete biodegradation is much shorter than for "conventional"  plastic s which, in normal environments, are very slow to biodegrade and cause  large scale harm . 
95_7	CAR_3cc9acb368ca2c72cf309e1292cadcd6898e73d9	The effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions. Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption. For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy.
95_7	CAR_4db174734238d01f34cdbc40f94f1c7c9b767fed	There is no evidence that OXO-biodegradable plastic of any kind encourages littering or discourages recycling, and it is in fact indistinguishable to the naked eye from conventional plastic. The stored energy potential of OXO-biodegradable plastic could be retrieved by thermal recycling if collected during its useful life, as it has a similar calorific value to the raw product (fossil fuel) from which it was made.

He is the author of ‘’Green Plastics: An Introduction to the New Science of Biodegradable Plastics’’ (Princeton University Press, 2002), the first general audience book about the research and development of biodegradable plastics made from plants.  In 2012, the book inspired the invention of an edible LED lamp.
95_7	CAR_641ec0834bb860a7ec1e8d647bce91a4bd9377c6	Two basic classes of biodegradable plastics exist:  Bioplastic s, whose components are derived from renewable raw materials, and plastics made from  petrochemical s containing  biodegradable additives  which enhance biodegradation.

95_7	CAR_7a264f3642906c62492e38449fa0c998fd709510	The terminology used in the bioplastics sector is sometimes misleading. Most in the industry use the term bioplastic to mean a plastic produced from a biological source. All (bio- and petroleum-based) plastics are technically  biodegradable , meaning they can be degraded by microbes under suitable conditions. However, many degrade so slowly that they are considered non-biodegradable. Some petrochemical-based plastics are considered biodegradable, and may be used as an additive to improve the performance of commercial bioplastics. Non-biodegradable bioplastics are referred to as durable. The biodegradability of bioplastics depends on temperature, polymer stability, and available oxygen content. The European standard EN13432, published by the  International Organization for Standardization , defines how quickly and to what extent a plastic must be degraded under the tightly controlled and aggressive conditions (at or above 140 °F) of an  industrial composting  unit for it to be considered biodegradable. This standard is recognized in many countries, including all of Europe, Japan and the US. However, it applies only to industrial composting units and does not set out a standard for  home composting . Most bioplastics (e.g. PH) only biodegrade quickly in industrial composting units. These materials do not biodegrade quickly in ordinary compost piles or in the soil/water. Starch-based bioplastics are an exception, and will biodegrade in normal composting conditions.
95_7	CAR_b3024810839f01ac700e140c76f8495ed5f93519	The term "biodegradable plastic" has also been used by producers of specially modified petrochemical-based plastics that appear to biodegrade. Biodegradable plastic bag manufacturers that have misrepresented their product's biodegradability may now face legal action in the US state of California for the misleading use of the terms biodegradable or compostable. Traditional plastics such as  polyethylene  are degraded by  ultra-violet  (UV) light and oxygen. To prevent this, process manufacturers add stabilising chemicals. However, with the addition of a degradation initiator to the plastic, it is possible to achieve a controlled  UV / oxidation  disintegration process. This type of plastic may be referred to as degradable plastic or oxy-degradable plastic or photodegradable plastic because the process is not initiated by microbial action. While some degradable plastics manufacturers argue that degraded plastic residue will be attacked by microbes, these degradable materials do not meet the requirements of the EN13432 commercial composting standard. The bioplastics industry has widely criticized oxo-biodegradable plastics, which the industry association says do not meet its requirements. Oxo-biodegradable plastics – known as "oxos" – are conventional petroleum-based products with some additives that initiate degradation. The ASTM standard for oxo-biodegradables is called the Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation (ASTM 6954). Both EN 13432 and ASTM 6400 are specifically designed for PLA and Starch based products and should not be used as a guide for oxos.
95_7	CAR_cc2951f82d5df8787ab631fdb56c125f1d30cb22	The useful life of a product made using oxo-biodegradable plastic can be programmed at manufacture, typically 6 months for a bread wrapper and 18 months for a lighweight,  plastic carrier bag  to allow for re-use. Oxo-biodegradable plastic can be manufactured with the existing machinery and workforce in factories at little or no extra cost.  They have the same strength and other characteristics as ordinary plastics during their intended lifetime.
95_7	CAR_ccd0d66f4ee1614665b6b4cd47014880b0b9ce50	Each year hundreds of millions of tons of  plastic s are produced from  petroleum .  Most of these plastics will remain in  landfill s for years to come or  litter  the environment posing significant health risks to animals; however, the average person's lifestyle would be impractical without them (see  Applications ). One solution to this conundrum lies in biodegradable polymers. These polymers have the distinct advantage that over time they will break down. Dr. Geoffrey Coates headed research to create catalysts that can not only efficiently create these biodegradable polymers, but the polymers also incorporate the  greenhouse gas  and  global warming  contributor, CO, and, environmentally present ground- ozone  producer, CO.  These two gases can be found or produced in high concentrations from agricultural waste,  coal , and industrial applications as byproducts. Not only do the catalysts utilize these normally wasted and environmentally unfriendly gases, but they also do it extremely efficiently with high  turnover number s and frequencies in addition to good selectivity. These catalysts have been actively used by  Novomer Inc  to make polycarbonates that can replace the current coating  bisphenol A  (BPA) found in many food and drink packaging. Novomer's analysis shows that if used in all cases, these biodegradable polymer coatings could not only sequester, but also avoid further production of CO in hundreds of millions of metric tons in just a single year.
95_7	CAR_d9610f897c12b73c7a4d4243a27a73545b23201c	Bioplastics are  plastic s derived from renewable  biomass  sources, such as  vegetable fats and oils ,  corn starch , or  microbiota . Bioplastic can be made from agricultural  by-product s and also from used  plastic bottle s and other containers using microorganisms. Common plastics, such as  fossil-fuel plastic s (also called petrobased polymers), are derived from  petroleum  or  natural gas . Production of such plastics tends to require more  fossil fuel s and to produce more  greenhouse gases  than the production of biobased polymers (bioplastics). Some, but not all, bioplastics are designed to  biodegrade . Biodegradable bioplastics can break down in either  anaerobic  or  aerobic  environments, depending on how they are manufactured. Bioplastics can be composed of  starch es,  cellulose ,  biopolymer s, and a variety of other materials.
95_7	CAR_dc6a6bbbf74b2b48ee1481d833fabe88c998462b	In addition to the increased runoff that results from plasticulture, there is also the problem of the increased amount of waste form the plastic mulch itself. The use of plastic mulch for vegetables, strawberries, and other row and orchard crops exceeds 110 million pounds annually in the United States. Most plastic ends up in the landfill, although there are other disposal options such as disking mulches into the soil, on-site burying, on-site storage, reuse, recycling, and incineration. The incineration and recycling options are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics. Plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals, which limits the amount of products that can be recycled. Research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or  photodegradable  mulches. While there has been minor success with this, there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade, as many biodegradable products take a long time to break down.
95_7	CAR_ec22b9c32c9ddbfe44ba1e05332d976cb657ac58	Compostable plastics combine the utility of plastics (lightweight, resistance, relative low cost) with the ability to completely and fully compost in an industrial compost facility. Rather than worrying about recycling a relatively small quantity of commingled plastics, proponents argue that certified biodegradable plastics can be readily commingled with other organic wastes, thereby enabling composting of a much larger position of nonrecoverable solid waste.  Commercial composting for all mixed organics then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable. More municipalities can divert significant quantities of waste from overburdened landfills since the entire waste stream is now biodegradable and therefore easier to process. This move away from the use of landfills may help alleviate the issue of  plastic pollution .
95_7	CAR_ed75fb8f6337f64f67db8ae9dd8058c286b6791c	There are also other types of degradable materials that are not considered to be biopolymers, because they are oil-based, similar to other conventional plastics. These plastics are made to be more degradable through the use of different additives, which help them degrade when exposed to UV rays or other physical stressors. However, biodegradation-promoting additives for polymers have been shown not to significantly increase biodegradation.
95_7	CAR_edc8c9017deb08f279deb000a803f46db112c5d5	Biodegradable  plastics break down (degrade) upon exposure to sunlight (e.g.,  ultra-violet radiation ), water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes, wind abrasion, and in some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack are also included as forms of  biodegradation  or  environmental degradation . Some modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface, whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems.  Starch  powder has been mixed with plastic as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily, but it still does not lead to complete breakdown of the plastic. Some researchers have actually  genetically engineered  bacteria that synthesize a completely biodegradable plastic, but this material, such as  Biopol , is expensive at present. Companies have made  biodegradable additives  to enhance the biodegradation of plastics.
95_7	MARCO_3396201	How plastic is made. Plastics are derived from organic products. The materials used in the production of plastics are natural products such as cellulose, coal, natural gas, salt and, of course, crude oil. Crude oil is a complex mixture of thousands of compounds. To become useful, it must be processed. The production of plastic begins with a distillation process in an oil refinery.

95_7	MARCO_6170128	Biodegradable Plastics. Biodegradable plastic is plastic that decomposes naturally in the environment. This is achieved when microorganisms in the environment metabolize and break down the structure of biodegradable plastic. The end result is one which is less harmful to the environment than traditional plastics.ith biodegradable plastic, you get a substance made from natural sources that does not contain these chemical fillers, and does not pose the same risk to the environment. The process of making biodegradable plastics begins with the melting down of all the materials.
95_7	MARCO_6170131	Biodegradable plastics are plastics that decompose by the action of living organisms, usually bacteria.nder proper conditions, some biodegradable plastics can degrade to the point where microorganisms can completely metabolise them to carbon dioxide (and water). For example, starch-based bioplastics produced from sustainable farming methods could be almost carbon neutral.
95_7	MARCO_6967069	Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions. Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption.

95_7	MARCO_7596876	Plastics are polymers, but polymers don't have to be plastics. The way plastics are made is actually a way of imitating nature, which has created a huge number of polymers. Cellulose, the basic component of plant cell walls is a polymer, and so are all the proteins produced in your body and the proteins you eat.ne of the most common is the plastic grocery bag. Polyethylene is made from just ethylene monomers-but it's also possible to create polymers from two or more different monomers. You can make hundreds of different polymers depending on which monomers and catalysts you use.
95_7	MARCO_8217309	Biodegradable plastics are made from all-natural plant materials. These can include corn oil, orange peels, starch, and plants. Traditional plastic is made with chemical fillers that can be harmful to the environment when released when the plastic is melted down.
95_7	MARCO_8217312	Biodegradable plastics can be composed of bio-plastics, which are plastics made from renewable raw materials. There are normally two forms of biodegradable plastic, injection molded and solid. The solid forms normally are used for items such as food containers, leaf collection bags, and water bottles.

95_8	CAR_0d9e77e3e453d1c33087c53c152dffa3f00bce8e	There is much debate about the total carbon, fossil fuel and water usage in manufacturing bioplastics from natural materials and whether they are a negative impact to human food supply. To make  of polylactic acid, the most common commercially available compostable plastic,   of corn is required. Since 270 million tonnes of plastic are made every year, replacing conventional plastic with corn-derived polylactic acid would remove 715.5 million tonnes from the world's food supply, at a time when global warming is reducing tropical farm productivity. "Although U.S. corn is a highly productive crop, with typical yields between 140 and 160 bushels per acre, the resulting delivery of food by the corn system is far lower. Today’s corn crop is mainly used for biofuels (roughly 40 percent of U.S. corn is used for ethanol) and as animal feed (roughly 36 percent of U.S. corn, plus distillers grains left over from ethanol production, is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens). Much of the rest is exported.  Only a tiny fraction of the national corn crop is directly used for food for Americans, much of that for high-fructose corn syrup."

95_8	CAR_786556e1d9e0928d8826ba262845b7d3c0f032e9	On October 21, 2010, a group of scientists reported that corn-based plastic ranked higher in environmental defects than the main products it replaces, such as  HDPE ,  LDPE  and  PP . In the study, the production of corn-based plastics created more  acidification ,  carcinogens ,  ecotoxicity , eutrophication, ozone depletion, respiratory effects and smog than the synthetic-based plastics they replaced. However the study also concluded that biopolymers trumped the other plastics for biodegradability, low toxicity, and use of renewable resources.
95_8	CAR_80003b538a19ad5e6a23470095d63d078d343994	Many biodegradable polymers that come from renewable resources (i.e. starch-based, PHA, PLA) also compete with food production, as the primary feedstock is currently corn. For the US to meet its current output of plastics production with BPs, it would require 1.62 square meters per kilogram produced.  While this space requirement could be feasible, it is always important to consider how much impact this large scale production could have on food prices and the  opportunity cost  of using land in this fashion versus alternatives.
95_8	CAR_d23c893f33166726da1826d4fae7e6cceb973c6f	Another major factor in petroleum demand is the widespread use of petroleum products such as  plastic .  These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil,  corn starch , hemp plants, pea starch, or  microbiota . They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.

The solvent is evaporated from the corn oil, recovered, and re-used.  After extraction, the corn oil is then refined by  degumming  and/or alkali treatment, both of which remove  phosphatides .  Alkali treatment also neutralizes free fatty acids and removes color (bleaching). Final steps in refining include  winterization  (the removal of waxes), and deodorization by steam distillation of the oil at  under a high vacuum.

In late 2003, Japan suspended  imports of American beef  due to a  BSE  incident in Washington State, cutting off Yoshinoya's main source of  short plate  (fatty beef) that is the main component of its beef bowl. This forced Yoshinoya to terminate beef bowl sales in Japan for the first time in its history on February 11, 2004. News of the removal of this item from Yoshinoya's menu caused its fans and non-fans alike to queue in massive lines at its restaurants all around Japan to taste what might be their last beef bowl for a long time. Yoshinoya then switched to serving pork bowl (butadon) instead of beef. On the other hand, its restaurants in the United States continued to serve the beef bowl using American short plate. From December 2, 2004, restaurants in Japan started serving "beef  yakiniku  bowls" (牛焼肉丼, gyū-yakiniku-don) which use Australian beef, different sauce and additional vegetables, distinguished from original "beef bowls" that use American beef.

In North America, China, and Taiwan, Yakiniku is also referred to as "Japanese barbecue" while in Japan the origin has become a subject of debate, though it is conventionally considered to be  Korean cuisine . In 2002 the  NHK  program NHK Ningen Kouza (NHK人間講座, literally NHK Humanity Lecture) stated: "While some tend to think that yakiniku came from Korea, it was born in post war Japan." Yet there are those who say that while yakiniku may have its beginnings in Japan, they believe it was first made by  Zainichi Koreans  (long-term Korean residents), and should therefore be considered Korean cuisine.
96_1	CAR_c8abf72ab99205fe0e8ee745023a924775d3d2b6	Yakiniku (焼き肉 or 焼肉), meaning " grilled   meat ", is a  Japanese  term which, in its broadest sense, refers to grilled meat dishes. "Yakiniku" originally referred to the "barbecue" of western food, which was given by Japanese writer  Kanagaki Robun  (仮名垣魯文) in his literature, "Seiyo Ryoritsu" (meaning "western food handbook"), in 1872 ( The Meiji period ). Meat has been eaten in Japan since the  Jōmon period . However, the rise of Buddhism made the eating of meat tabooed, and consequently some people have theorized that meat "disappeared" from the table from the Middle Ages to the  Edo period .  The term "yakiniku" became associated with  Korea n-derived cuisine during the early  Showa period .  Due to the  Korean War , Korean restaurants in Japan were divided into North Korean (Kita Chōsen) and South Korean (Kankoku); "yakiniku restaurant" arose as a  politically correct  term to refer to restaurants of either type.
96_1	CAR_d8f5e0c8f14983c14d173329b6e0c19e70132592	The popularity of yakiniku was given a further boost in 1991 when the easing of beef import restrictions led to a drop in the price of beef.

Sear the steak for around one or two minutes (depending on thickness) on both sides before placing it in the oven for around 8 minutes.ince wagyu is so expensive, you might choose to cook it the Japanese way-in small thin slices, either on a hot yaki-niku grill over a direct flame, or by the shabu-shabu method in boiling oily stock.

In late 2003, Japan suspended  imports of American beef  due to a  BSE  incident in Washington State, cutting off Yoshinoya's main source of  short plate  (fatty beef) that is the main component of its beef bowl. This forced Yoshinoya to terminate beef bowl sales in Japan for the first time in its history on February 11, 2004. News of the removal of this item from Yoshinoya's menu caused its fans and non-fans alike to queue in massive lines at its restaurants all around Japan to taste what might be their last beef bowl for a long time. Yoshinoya then switched to serving pork bowl (butadon) instead of beef. On the other hand, its restaurants in the United States continued to serve the beef bowl using American short plate. From December 2, 2004, restaurants in Japan started serving "beef  yakiniku  bowls" (牛焼肉丼, gyū-yakiniku-don) which use Australian beef, different sauce and additional vegetables, distinguished from original "beef bowls" that use American beef.

Some foreign firms that built bengoshi practices under this system, such as  Linklaters  and  Allen & Overy , have since downsized or eliminated their bengoshi teams, while others such as  Herbert Smith Freehills  elected to rely on referral relationships with the  Big Four law firms  rather than competing with them by employing bengoshi within the firm.

Prior to 1949, their practice was limited to cases involving foreigners or international matters. From 1949 until 1955, foreign lawyers were allowed to practice both Japanese and foreign law by registering with the  Supreme Court of Japan , and were even allowed to litigate in cases involving foreign aliens. Although this system ended in 1955, lawyers already registered under the system, known as junkaiin or "quasi-members" of the bar, were allowed to continue practicing. The junkaiin played a major role in Japan's international trade during the following decades, and trained many Japanese lawyers in the area of international business transactions. It was also common for foreign lawyers to serve as "trainees" in Japanese law firms, effectively practicing foreign law under the supervision of a Japanese-qualified attorney.

In 2005, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations circulated a letter requesting that all foreign partners in law firms in Japan register as gaiben. This was followed in 2009 by a similar letter requesting that all foreign attorneys providing legal services in Japan be registered as gaiben, regardless of their title within their firm; the JFBA later clarified that this was not intended to impose new requirements but rather to remind firms of existing requirements.

A revised law enacted in 1994 made it possible to establish fee-sharing (but not profit-sharing) "joint enterprises" between gaiben and local lawyers. Further revisions in 2003 removed the prohibitions on employment of Japanese attorneys and allowed profit-sharing joint ventures between foreign and Japanese attorneys.

97_1	CAR_02f25ff97d9b3b38c1909d6ecaf61c330d50e67c	The 1989 season opened with the Browns defeating the  rival  Pittsburgh Steelers at  Three Rivers Stadium  in Pittsburgh 51–0, which as of  2010  remains the most lopsided game in the rivalry, as well as the all-time worst loss for the Steelers. The rest of the season was headlined by Slaughter's Pro Bowl-worthy 1,236 yards receiving, and was a success at 7–3 until a 10–10 tie with Schottenheimer's Chiefs in November led to a three-game losing streak. Two comeback wins over the Minnesota Vikings and Houston Oilers in the season's final two weeks kept them in the playoff race. The tie ended up being the Browns' saving grace, with their 9–6–1 record winning them the AFC Central title and first-round bye over the Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers at 9–7. The Browns narrowly survived a scare from the Buffalo Bills in their divisional playoff game, when  Scott Norwood  missed an extra point that would have pulled Buffalo within three points and, later, when  Jim Kelly 's desperation pass to the  end zone  on the final play of the game was intercepted by Clay Matthews.

In addition, the 49ers and the  Pittsburgh Penguins  once had common ownership through the DeBartolo-York family from 1978 to 1991, selling the Penguins right after that team won the  1991 Stanley Cup . Steelers president  Art Rooney II  publicly supported the Ravens, due to both teams being division rivals and showing how good the  AFC North  is. In nearby  Youngstown, Ohio , where the DeBartolo-York family that owns the 49ers resides and which the Steelers share with the  rival   Cleveland Browns  for territorial rights, the area was more decisively in favor of the 49ers winning, both in support of the DeBartolo-York family as well as lingering resentment towards  Art Modell  for  moving the original Cleveland Browns to Baltimore  in 1996. Earlier in the season, the 49ers also practiced at  Youngstown State University  in between road games on the East Coast.

As recent as 1984, the  Cleveland Browns  and  Pittsburgh Steelers  played a preseason game despite the two being  bitter rivals .

However, the team was once again eliminated in a first-round, Wild Card game for a fifth straight year, this time against divisional rival  Pittsburgh Steelers . Up 16-15 near the end of the fourth quarter, Lewis faced criticism for not keeping his players under control after penalties drawn by  Vontaze Burfict  and  Adam Jones  moved the Steelers into field goal range and allowed them to make a game-winning kick with eighteen seconds remaining.

In the 1970s, the Steelers and Raiders during many of those seasons were the two best teams in the AFC and, arguably, the NFL. The Raiders regularly met the Steelers in the playoffs, and the winner of the Steelers-Raiders game went on to win the Super Bowl in 3 of those instances, from 1974 to 1976. The rivalry garnered attention in the sports media, with controversial plays, late hits, accusations and public statements.

In a strange twist of fate,  Art Modell , former owner of the Steelers' traditional rival, the  Cleveland Browns , agreed to suspend the Browns franchise (it was revived in 1999) in return for taking his players to Baltimore. The inter-divisional rivalry carried over with both teams remaining in what was then the AFC Central Division. Since the AFC Central was restructured into the AFC North in 2002, the Steelers and Ravens have dominated the division, winning at least a share of almost every division title.

Jeff Reed  nailed a field goal before the half to draw the Steelers within 10, and hit another in the third to bring them within a touchdown. However, a scoreless fourth by both teams led the Browns to their first win against the Steelers since 2003, and the Browns became only the fourth team in NFL history to be at least 10 games under .500 and defeat the defending  Super Bowl  champions.

When the league was voting on the Browns relocation, Steelers owner  Dan Rooney  was one of only two owners to vote against the move. In tribute of Cleveland losing the Browns, Steeler fans wore orange arm bands to the final game at  Three Rivers Stadium  as a sign of mutual respect and sorrow for losing a great rivalry. While Browns fans still consider the Steelers as their main archrival, almost all Steeler fans consider their  rivalry  with the  Baltimore Ravens  the  spiritual successor  to this rivalry due to Art Modell moving his franchise to  Baltimore  and establishing the expansion Ravens. The recent one-sidedness of this rivalry in favor of the Steelers has influenced this thinking as well. Nevertheless, it is still one of the most heated in the NFL.
97_1	CAR_1a413b84a60bfb539cd745755a6b5c6915109a62	The rivalry has reached unprecedented heights as a result of the 2016 WildCard playoff game. After previously having bad blood between the divisional rival from incidents in the 2015 regular season, the two teams met in the postseason. The contest was rife with physical play and penalty flags on both sides.  Ryan Shazier  knocked  Giovani Bernard  unconscious and celebrated the hit on the field riling up the Bengals and their fans as no flag was thrown on the play. The game appeared over after Burfict intercepted  Landry Jones , who was in due to an injury to  Ben Roethlisberger  after being sacked by  Vontaze Burfict . But  Jeremy Hill  fumbled the ball and the Steelers recovered on their 9yd line with 1:36 remaining.  Ben Roethlisberger  returned and drove the Steelers to the Bengals 47 yard line with :18 remaining. Burfict was flagged for hitting a defenseless receiver,  Antonio Brown , on an incomplete pass while Jones was penalized for bumping a referee while going after Steelers assistant coach  Joey Porter  during the injury timeout. Porter received no flag for his actions. These fouls advanced the Steelers 30 yards with under 20 seconds remaining in the game, allowing Pittsburgh to kick a 35-yard field goal for the victory.
97_1	CAR_1e0a3123de60ec28646e6e07570c48892c56a2ab	For the  2016 NFL season , it was expected that all 32 teams would now participate, with some teams eager to unveil their Color Rush uniforms. The  Pittsburgh Steelers —one of the league's more conservative and tradition-bound teams with regards to uniforms—were the only team that didn't participate in the 2015 Color Rush that revealed their Color Rush uniform style (but not revealing their uniform itself) before the leaguewide unveil, confirming that it wear all-black uniforms with gold numbers on Christmas Day against the  Baltimore Ravens . The team had planned on wearing a Color Rush uniform for its only Thursday Night match up against the  Indianapolis Colts  at  Lucas Oil Stadium , but opted for the home game on Christmas against its hated rival and will wear their standard road uniforms against the Colts. It was later announced that Thanksgiving games were exempt from the Color Rush promotion.

97_1	CAR_28e2574843cc89d20b51ae7a1b44945e895525a0	2011 marked one of the most successful seasons in Baltimore Ravens franchise history. The Ravens started their campaign with a big 35–7 victory at home over their rivals the  Pittsburgh Steelers . Other key victories included a 34–17 victory over the  New York Jets  in week three, a week six 29–14 victory over the  Houston Texans , and a week nine win over the Steelers, this would be the first time since 2006 that the Ravens would sweep Pittsburgh in the  AFC North  division.
97_1	CAR_2a8db78f28294ef911dbf9e85eccc68df85e7e69	The rivalry is not quite as historic as the  Bengals–Browns rivalry , however, many Bengals fans consider the Steelers to be their greatest rivals, much like  Cleveland Browns   fans . ( Steeler fans , however, often consider the  Baltimore Ravens  as their top rival.) It is disputed which is the more widely bitter rivalry, but this specific rivalry is often ranked as one of the NFL's most bitter, chiefly due to the Steelers having more championships and the events of the 2005 wild card playoff game between the two teams. Similarly, these are the only two AFC North teams to experience Super Bowl losses, with each team losing two.
97_1	CAR_2e0c370c6290f23d1cb405ff5b81b47c3f62c92e	The Pittsburgh Steelers headed to Oakland, CA in week three to take on their long-time rivals.  The Steelers would score first on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to tight end Heath Miller, but the Raiders would respond when running back Darren McFadden would break loose on a run and take it 64-yards for a touchdown.  Heath Miller would catch another 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Raiders would once again respond with a 3-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer to Darrius Heyward-Bey.  The Steelers would kick a 33-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to give them a 17–14 lead.  The Steelers would begin the second half by driving down the field and scoring on a 22-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace.  But the Raiders would yet again respond with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Richard Gordon.  The Steelers would again drive down the field easily, but Antonio Brown would fumble the football in the endzone.  After review, it was determined that Brown had recovered his own fumble and the Steelers found themselves leading the game 31–21 with 1:31 left in the third quarter.  Early in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh safety Ryan Mundy, playing for the injured Troy Polamalu, committed a helmet-to-helmet hit on Oakland receiver Heyward-Bey.  The hit knocked Heyward-Bey unconscious and he was taken to the hospital with a concussion and sprained neck.  (Mundy was not flagged for the illegal hit by the replacement referees, but would be fined by the NFL a few days later.)  The Steelers secondary issues from the past few years continued, as they could not stop Carson Palmer and the Raiders passing attack.  The Raiders would score on a 6-yard touchdown pass and a 32-yard field goal to tie the game at 31.  The Steelers had a chance to win the game late in the fourth quarter, but the Raiders defense held them to a 3-and-out and forced them to punt the ball back.  Palmer would again exploit Pittsburgh's suspect secondary and kicker Janikowski would kick a 43-yard field goal as time expired to give the Raiders a 34–31 victory over the Steelers, their first of the season.  The Steelers would head into their bye-week 1–2, and eventually ended up being the only AFC North team to lose to the Raiders.

The young team showed its inexperience in the first game of the season, when they lost  at home  to the  archrival   Cleveland Browns  51–0. The loss marked the Steelers worst defeat in franchise history. The following week wasn't much better, losing 41–10 to another  division rival , the  defending AFC Champion   Cincinnati Bengals .

97_1	CAR_346224f00c74f5ee0630bde5d6928d16c4b24a64	By far the team's biggest rival is the  Pittsburgh Steelers . Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-5-hour drive along  Interstate 70 . Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play twice a year in the  AFC North , and have met four times in the playoffs. Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire as most within the last 5 years have come down to 3 points or less.The rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the  NFL  today.

Byner was traded to the Washington Redskins in April, while the Browns moved up in the draft to acquire  Eric Metcalf . Kevin Mack, meanwhile, was suspended for the first four games of the 1989 season after pleading guilty to cocaine possession. Despite these changes, Kosar led Cleveland to a division-winning 9–6–1 record in 1989, including a season-opening 51–0 shutout of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and the team's first victory over the Denver Broncos in 15 years. Cleveland narrowly survived a scare from the  Buffalo Bills  in the first playoff game, staving off a comeback thanks to an interception in the Browns' end zone by Clay Matthews with 14 seconds on the clock. The victory set up the third AFC championship matchup in four years between the Browns and Broncos. The Broncos led from start to finish, and a long Elway touchdown pass to Sammy Winder put the game way in the fourth quarter. Denver won 37–21.
97_1	CAR_3eb254b96fcf41be30ccaf0fe7c067d1d9baf809	The Steelers stayed home for a SNF duel against longtime division rival Bengals.  The first quarter was all Steelers as they scored touchdowns in 3 different ways:  Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard, Antonio Brown caught a 12-yard pass, and then returned a punt 67 yards putting up scores of 7-0, 14-0, and 21-0.  This remains the most points in their franchise history they have scored in the first quarter while it remains the largest number of points the Bengals have allowed in the first quarter alone.  This streak of points stood at 24 straight as Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal.  The Bengals finally got on the board as Gio Benard ran for a 1-yard touchdown making the score 24-7.  Suisham then nailed a 45-yard field goal to move his team ahead 27-7 at halftime.  After this, the Steelers went back to work in the 3rd quarter coming away with another field goal from 26 yards out for a 30-7 lead.  The 4th quarter however, was all Bengals as Andy Dalton and Tyler Eifert connected on a 1-yard touchdown pass making the score 30-14 not long before Dalton found Marvin Jones on a 13-yard pass making the score 30-20, but the 2-point conversion failed as the Steelers would eventually win the game with that score as the final sending them to 6-8.  Coupled with losses of the Ravens, Chargers, and Dolphins, the Steelers also remained in the playoff hunt.
97_1	CAR_3efb47bfadb2aed70ee03e4599cc07179996e533	Another difficult issue that at the time, was that the Steelers and Eagles were bitter interstate rivals, much like the  NHL's   Pittsburgh Penguins - Philadelphia Flyers  rivalry of today, and usually ended up at near the bottom of standings each year. The Steagles were the only professional sports team where all the players held full-time war jobs, as it was a requirement of the team. Playing football was seen as an extracurricular activity. All of the 25 players on the roster kept full-time jobs in defense plants. One of Pittsburgh's players,  Ted Doyle , worked at  Westinghouse Electric  and figured out later that his work assisted the  Manhattan Project , which was America's effort to build the first  atomic bomb , according to Matthew Algeo's book Last Team Standing.

In 1970, the merger became final, as a result of the merger, the AFC (American Football Conference) featuring all the AFL teams and the NFC (National Football Conference) featuring all the "old" NFL teams. Two teams from the NFL were asked to join the AFL in the AFC, the  Baltimore Colts , and the  Cleveland Browns  (the Browns owner,  Art Modell  asked the NFL Commissioner,  Pete Rozelle  if he could join to play the Cincinnati Bengals in the  Battle of Ohio ). Upon hearing this,  Art Rooney  (Steelers Owner) asked Rozelle if he could join to keep the  Steelers-Browns rivalry  alive. So, the Steelers would begin playing in the AFC and would leave the Eagles rivalry and many others they had playing the NFC teams. Also, the Steelers moved into the then state-of-the-art,  Three Rivers Stadium  and left  Pitt Stadium . The new Three Rivers was one of the many "cookie-cutter" stadiums across the league and became an icon to Pittsburgh.

The Steelers were down 24–7 in the third quarter, but Maddox led them on a wild comeback.  Jerame Tuman ,  Hines Ward , and  Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala  all scored fourth-quarter touchdowns to win the game 36–33. The divisional playoff against the  Tennessee Titans  was just as dramatic.  Hines Ward  tied the game early in the fourth quarter with a 21-yard touchdown, and the game eventually went to overtime. Tennessee won the toss and Titans kicker  Joe Nedney  lined up for a field goal, which he made. But the Steelers called timeout so the field goal did not count. Nedney's second try went wide right, but the Steelers were called for running into the kicker on  Dewayne Washington . The third try was good and officially counted as the game winner, but over protests by  Bill Cowher  who thought he called another timeout first.

Throughout the game, the song was also played sporadically during game breaks. Although the Bengals won the game 20-10, the song drew much criticism by Bengals fans and even some of the team's players. One Bengals fan even told the  Wall Street Journal  that  Steeler fans  sitting near him were laughing at the Bengals fans throughout the game; the Steelers themselves have used the  Styx  song " Renegade " frequently at  Heinz Field  since 2001. Four days after the game, the team publicly apologized, announcing that while the song would not be nixed from  Paul Brown Stadium 's playlist completely, the team would use a  hard rock  or  classic rock  song for player introductions moving forward.
97_1	CAR_5e21e42d40e2768f7b7792f11fffd131dee18f69	The move would also have an effect in  Pittsburgh  as well. Steelers owner  Dan Rooney  was one of two owners to oppose Modell's move to Baltimore because of a mutual respect for the team and the fans. Because of the move, the  Browns–Steelers rivalry , arguably one of the most heated rivalries in the NFL, has somewhat cooled in Pittsburgh due to the new Browns' lack of success. The  Steelers–Ravens rivalry  is considered the  spiritual successor  by fans in Pittsburgh and is one of the most heated current rivalries in the NFL. Since returning to the NFL, the Browns and Steelers rivalry has been largely one-sided in favor of Pittsburgh; although the rivalry is not as intense in Pittsburgh, Browns fans still consider it their top rivalry despite the Browns' recent struggles against the Steelers.

While the  Baltimore Colts  and the  Cleveland Browns  readily joined the new conference (the Colts due to the money, the Browns due to owner  Art Modell  eyeing a  potential intrastate rivalry  with the  Cincinnati Bengals ), the Steelers were hesitant to join until Steelers owner  Art Rooney  told his son  Dan Rooney  that the payment plus keeping the  rivalry  with the Browns was important, although it was losing its longstanding rivalry with the  Philadelphia Eagles . Additionally, a  rivalry  with the Bengals also made geographic sense for the team.

Though the Browns dominated this rivalry early in the series (winning the first eight matchups), the Steelers currently have the all-time edge 68–58, making it the oldest rivalry in the  AFC . Former Browns owner  Art Modell  scheduled home games against the Steelers on Saturday night from 1964 to 1970 to help fuel the rivalry. The rivalry has been fueled by the proximity of the two teams, number of championships both teams have won, players and personnel having played and/or coached for both sides, and personal bitterness. Though the rivalry has cooled in Pittsburgh due to the Modell move (as well as the Browns having a 5–24 record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999), the Steelers are still top rival for Cleveland.

With a 134.3 passer rating, Maddox completed 21-for-29 passes for 260 yards and three touchdowns.  Hines Ward  caught two of the touchdowns and  Jay Riemersma  one. Although Maddox passed for 336 yards the following game in a Week 2 (September 14) 41–20 loss to the  Kansas City Chiefs , Maddox regressed statistically, with 28-for-47 passing, one touchdown, three interceptions, four sacks, and a 62.0 rating.

Late in the second quarter, Maddox successfully completed a  trick play  called "Bengal", in which on field goal formation (fourth-and-three at the 50), Maddox took the snap on his knee and passed to  Jerame Tuman , who advanced 23 yards to the Bengals' nine yard line. This trick play would lead to a touchdown and Steelers 7–0 edge at halftime. With 5:54 left in the fourth quarter, the Steelers  ran down the clock  the point where Maddox  took a knee  to seal the victory. Afterwards, the Steelers would lose five in a row and fall to 2–6 for the first half of the season.

On 11-of-24 passing for 136 yards and a 29.2 passer rating, Maddox threw two interceptions and lost one fumble; Cleveland cornerback  Daylon McCutcheon  returned one interception 75 yards for a touchdown. At  Mile High Stadium  on Week 6 (October 12), Pittsburgh lost 17–14 to the  Denver Broncos . This game was Maddox's first interception-free game since Week 1, but Maddox was sacked seven times for 56 yards.

The team finished with a 7-4 record and looked forward to the next season. However, due to the loss of players in the US draft, the team was forced to  combine operation  with the cross-state rival, Philadelphia Eagles. This would be one of the first times the Steelers felt that fate interrupted the future success that was expected. The Steelers wouldn't post another winning season until  1947 , even then, their future was interrupted by fate.

The season started off with a win against the  Detroit Lions  at home. The Chargers lost to the  Cincinnati Bengals  and  Minnesota Vikings  on the road before defeating the  Cleveland Browns  on a last second field goal. Following their 2-2 start, the Chargers lost their next six games, dropping to 2-8. In their six straight losses, they lost heartbreakers to the  Pittsburgh Steelers ,  Green Bay Packers ,  Baltimore Ravens  and the  Chicago Bears , as well as sound defeats by both, division rivals, the  Oakland Raiders  and the  Kansas City Chiefs . They finally broke their losing streak by defeating the  Jacksonville Jaguars  on the road, bringing their record to 3-8, in last place in the  AFC West  and 3rd worst in the  American Football Conference  (one game ahead of both the Browns and the  Tennessee Titans ). They are also tied for the third worst record in the  National Football League . They then proceeded to beat the Miami Dolphins in Week 14 winning 30-14. They finished the season 4-12.

While the  Steel Curtain  held down the Colts, the offense stalled out in a cold and wet  Three Rivers Stadium . They turned the ball over five times. But an interception by CB Mel Blount gave a chance for the Steelers to take over. After a Rocky Bleier, #20, touchdown, a fumble recovery by LB #34 Andy Russell looked to seal the game. However, it wasn't before Andy took the ball on what  Sports Illustrated  called "the longest slowest touchdown ever witnessed". The Steelers won, 28-10, and prepared for their rival,  the Oakland Raiders . Like last year, the Steelers would play the  AFC Championship  against them, however, this time in the comfort of Three Rivers and the ice. All week the weather was awful in Pittsburgh, after the field tarp split during the night, the sidelines became iced over and narrowed the field for the deep outside passing game of Oakland. The teams scored a total of 3 points in the first three quarters. Both teams combined for 13 turnovers. The most heated rivalry was stuck in a deep-freeze. It had been escalating for four years, and now it was escalating on every play. During the 3rd, #88 Lynn Swann was taken out of the game by a clothesline tackle from Raiders S #43  George Atkinson . He had been knocked out and later, was in the hospital. In the 4th quarter, the Steelers scored on a 25-yard run to the outside by #32 Franco Harris. It was a play in which John Stallworth made a key block on two Raider defenders. Later, a 20-yard pass caught by Stallworth put them up, 16-7. The game ended on a #12  Ken Stabler  pass to #21  Cliff Branch , who was tackled down by CB #47  Mel Blount . The Steelers were headed to the  Super Bowl  again.

This is only the third time Pittsburgh has lost a game in Ohio ever since their quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, an Ohio native who was sitting out of the game due to injury, was drafted by them in 2004.  Also, Mike Tomlin's record against the Browns all-time would drop to 9–2. The Browns would eventually become the only division rival whom the Steelers would lose to on the road during the season, after winning in Cincinnati on Sunday Night Football and before winning in Baltimore the next week; the 2000 season was the last time these three events occurred together.

The two teams have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in  1970 , the lone exception being  1982 , when the annual matchup in  Cincinnati  was canceled due to the  player's strike ; the teams only met in Week 2 in  Pittsburgh  that season just before the start of the strike. Originally placed in the  AFC Central  following the  AFL–NFL merger , the two teams currently compete in that division's successor, the  AFC North .

He received immediate interest from a handful of teams, including Pittsburgh's three division rivals—the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens. The  Dallas Cowboys ,  New York Giants  and San Diego Chargers were also in the mix, but it came down to the Cincinnati Bengals and Miami Dolphins. After Dolphins head coach  Cam Cameron  and  general manager   Randy Mueller  flew to Porter's home in owner  Wayne Huizenga 's jet, Porter was persuaded to sign with the Dolphins.

97_1	CAR_913ed0ab2f01ebd983f1a79a7c5e74e213e678bd	In the AFC, the  Pittsburgh Steelers  and  Cleveland Browns  have the longest rivalry with over 128 games, two in the playoffs, and 10 league titles between them. The "turnpike rivalry" as it is called is only separated by a two-hour drive and began during the  1950 NFL season . Both teams were NFL franchises predating the AFL that formed the basis of the AFC, and were moved to the AFC when the leagues merged in 1970; the only break in the rivalry was during the 1990s when the Browns  suspended operations for three years . While the  Indianapolis Colts  also moved over from the "old" NFL to the AFC, it hasn't had a continuous rival with either team from before the merger, though it had a minor rivalry with the Browns in the 1960s when the Colts were located in  Baltimore . The longest continuous rivalry in the AFC is several divisional rivalries from the  AFC East  (entire division except the  Miami Dolphins ) and  AFC West  (entire division) dating to the league's founding in 1960.

97_1	CAR_92eeac04870971384b7d17602e9d06cc826d0358	Entering the 2008 season, the Pittsburgh Steelers lost  Alan Faneca , after his contract expired and he signed with the  New York Jets . The Steelers also signed quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  to an eight-year, $102 million contract, the largest in franchise history. The Steelers also drafted  Rashard Mendenhall , running back from Illinois, with the 23rd overall pick in the  2008 NFL Draft  as well as top wide receiver prospect  Limas Sweed  of Texas with the 53rd overall pick. With injury to  Willie Parker  and uncertainty about his future production, Mendenhall was drafted to be the next Steelers running back of the future. The regular season went well with the team winning twelve games and losing four, all to strong opponents, with their only losses going to the  Philadelphia Eagles , the  New York Giants , the  Indianapolis Colts , and the  Tennessee Titans  (who had the best record in the league). The team thus earned a first-round bye and home advantage through the playoffs.  James Harrison  was voted as the 2008 AP Defensive Player of the Year with a monstrous regular season performance with 16 sacks (fourth in league) and 7 forced fumbles (first in the league).  Troy Polamalu  also had a great season, gaining seven interceptions which was tied for second in the league, trailing only  Ed Reed  of the  Baltimore Ravens  who had 9. Beating San Diego in the divisional round, they faced their AFC North rival Baltimore in the conference championship and soundly defeated them. Thus, the Steelers made it to their seventh Super Bowl. Their opponent was the  Arizona Cardinals , a team that had not appeared in any league championship since 1948.

After a scoreless first quarter, Pittsburgh began their dominance in the second quarter.  It started with QB  Ben Roethlisberger 's 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, kicker  Jeff Reed  nailed a 19-yard field goal, while Roethlisberger completed a 13-yard TD pass to RB  Najeh Davenport .  The Panthers would get their only score of the game with kicker  John Kasay 's 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Reed improved the Steelers' lead with a 45-yard field goal, while RB  Willie Parker  got a 41-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, rookie WR  Santonio Holmes  (who was plagued all year with fumbles on special teams) returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, Reed helped Pittsburgh wrap the game up with a 26-yard field goal.  With the win, the Steelers improved to 7–7. Stats

He was an excellent fit for the Steelers defense, most likely because of his blitzing abilities.  The Steelers finished the regular season with a 13-3 record, earning them the top seed in the AFC.  Bell was voted the  AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year .  The Steelers defeated their division rival, the  Baltimore Ravens , 27-10 in the AFC Divisional round at Heinz Field.  The following week they went on to face the second seeded  New England Patriots .  Bell recorded 8 tackles, a sack, and 2 passes defended.  Despite his stellar performance, and a late 4th quarter comeback, the Steelers wound up losing the game 24-17.  In 2002, Bell was injured in week 1 of the AFC Championship Game rematch versus New England.  He missed the next 4 games, but returned in week 7 to face the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night.  He finished the season with 50 tackles, (33 less from his rookie year), and 4 sacks.  The Steelers finished with a 10-5-1 record, and went on to face the  Cleveland Browns .  In an epic 36-33 comeback win over the Browns, Bell recorded 9 tackles but injured his knee in the final quarter and was listed as doubtful for the following week at Tennessee.  Although hurt, Bell started the game against the second seeded Titans.  He recorded only 2 tackles before leaving the game once again with an injury.  The Steelers lost 34-31.  In 2003, Bell amassed 99 tackles and 5 sacks despite the Steelers poor 6-10 finish.  In 2004, Bell injured his knee yet again, and would not see the field until week 9.  He played 3 games for the Steelers before he re-injured his knee in week 11 versus Cincinnati.  In the 2005 off-season, the Steelers, (who went 15-1 in the regular season without Bell), released him from the team.

It would mark the first time since the  1970 merger  that no team that was a member of the  American Football League  at any point in its history participated in the AFC Championship Game, as both the Colts and Steelers were with the "old" NFL before moving to the newly formed AFC in 1970 to even out the two conferences. (Since then, only the 2008 AFC Championship Game between the Steelers and their  archrivals , the  Baltimore Ravens , has the AFC title been played for between two non-AFL teams.) The game was a rematch of the Week 3 contest between the two teams from the previous season, which the Steelers won at home, 31–21. The 1995 AFC Championship Game would be the second of four consecutive seasons in which the two teams met in Pittsburgh, an uncommon sight for non-division rivals.

The Bengals came within 4 later on in the quarter when Mike Nugent kicked a 25-yard field goal for a 7–3 game. In the second quarter, the Steelers increased their lead when Chris Boswell kicked a 49-yard field goal to make it 10–3. The Bengals came within 4 again when Nugent kicked a 33-yard field goal to make it 10–6 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Steelers moved ahead by double digits when Roethlisberger found Jesse James on a 9-yard touchdown pass to make it 17–6. The Bengals reduced the lead when Nugent kicked another field goal from 21 yards out to make it 17–9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers pulled away as Roethlisberger found De'Angelo Williams on a 4-yard touchdown pass to make it 24–9. Though the Bengals wrapped up the scoring of the game when Andy Dalton found Giovani Bernard on a 25-yard touchdown pass to make the final score 24–16.

97_1	CAR_99acdc8eb7d357074074c99803d261f95549fada	Though the Steelers have mostly dominated this rivalry, it has heated up in recent seasons due to the Bengals resurgence among NFL teams. Even during the Bengals' dismal years in the 1990s and early 2000s when they were one of the NFL's worst teams, they would at times get the better of the Steelers, who were usually the dominant team in the division during the "Bungals" years. One notable example came in  1998 , when the Bengals swept the Steelers in the season series while finishing 3-13 overall. (Their only other win coming against the Detroit Lions in overtime). The loss knocked the Steelers out of playoff contention (they finished 7-9).

97_1	CAR_9f4e06a488f700d1f37df4a42411c3a7375cd16f	The  Pittsburgh Steelers ' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been very tight; as of the 2015 season the Raiders lead the rivalry 12 wins to 11, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3–3.  The rivalry was extremely intense during the 1970s. The Steelers knocked the Raiders out of the playoffs in three of four consecutive seasons in the early 1970s (the first loss was the " Immaculate Reception " game) until the Raiders finally beat the Steelers in the 1976  AFC Championship  (and went on to win  Super Bowl XI ). During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety  George Atkinson  delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver  Lynn Swann  that gave him a concussion. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson hit Swann again and gave him another concussion. After the second incident, Steelers head coach  Chuck Noll  referred to Atkinson as part of the "criminal element" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2 million  defamation  lawsuit against Noll and the Steelers, which he lost. The two clubs' three most recent contests harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close competition.  On December 6, 2009 the 3–8 Raiders helped spoil the  defending champions ' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in the fourth quarter and a  Louis Murphy  touchdown with 11 seconds to go won it 27–24 for the Raiders.  Oakland was then beaten 35–3 by Pittsburgh on November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 1970s history when Steelers quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  was punched by Raiders defensive end  Richard Seymour  following a touchdown. Most recently, on November 8, 2015 the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38-35 victory.  During the game the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver Antonio Brown to catch 17 passes for 284 yards.  Both are Steelers team records and the 284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history.
97_1	CAR_a34560bcd71268f7dccac4261350ff9d020cf7e5	The Steelers opened up their regular season on the road against their old AFC North division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens scored quickly on their first drive, when only three plays into the game, Baltimore wide receiver Anquan Boldin caught a 27-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco. The Ravens scored again on the ensuing drive when running back Ray Rice ran in a 1-yard touchdown, putting Baltimore on top 14–0 early in the first quarter. The Steelers battled back on the next drive, driving down to the Ravens 11-yard line. Pittsburgh scored on a third-and-goal play when wide receiver  Emmanuel Sanders  caught a touchdown in the back of the end zone from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Ravens responded by scoring again, this time on an 11-yard pass from Flacco to Rice. At halftime the Ravens led 21–7, just like in the 2010 playoffs. But unlike that game, the Ravens did not let up their dominance in the second half. On Pittsburgh's first play from scrimmage in the second quarter, Ravens defensive lineman  Haloti Ngata  stripped Roethlisberger of the football and recovered it at the Steelers 18-yard line. The Ravens scored yet again when tight end  Ed Dickson  caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Joe Flacco. A two-point conversion by punter/holder  Sam Koch  put the Ravens on top 29–7. The Ravens never looked back, and put up two more  Billy Cundiff  field goals to close out the game 35–7. The Steelers finished with 7 turnovers in the game. The loss marked the Steelers first opening day loss in 8 years, and left Pittsburgh at the bottom of the division with an 0–1 record.

With 128 meetings and counting, it is the oldest rivalry and surpasses other AFC rivalries by at least 5 contests. The two divisional foes have a natural rivalry due to the commonalities between the cities. It is sometimes called the Turnpike Rivalry because the majority of driving route between the two cities are connected via the  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio Turnpike . The Steelers lead the series 70-58.

In Pittsburgh, it is considered the  spiritual successor  to the  Browns–Steelers rivalry  due to the  Cleveland Browns relocation controversy  as well as the "reactivated" Browns having a poor record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999. Due to its physical nature, it has received comparisons to the rivalry the Steelers had with the  Oakland Raiders  in the 1970s, when those two teams were among the most physical teams in the league.  Both teams have also handed each other their first loss in their current stadiums; the Steelers handed the Ravens their first loss at PSINet Stadium (now  M&T Bank Stadium ) in 1998, while the Ravens  returned the favor  by handing the Steelers their first loss at  Heinz Field  in 2001.

These two teams had already been established as one of the league's best rivalries by this time, and Joe Greene's infamous kicking of the Browns lineman  Bob McKay  only fueled the rivalry. The fight that broke out afterwards caught it on fire. Greene was later fined $500 while the Steelers beat the Browns, 42-6. (2-1)
97_1	CAR_ac56dc63a89981a7a53bc9922e6fffdb029bc511	The rivalry carried over to the newly formed American Football Conference in 1970 as the two teams and then- Baltimore Colts  joined the former  American Football League  teams in the conference as part of the  AFL–NFL merger . The newly merged league needed to move three teams from the "old" NFL to the AFC so that the two conferences had 13 teams. (The rest of the "old" NFL teams joined the newly formed  National Football Conference .) The NFL tried to get the Steelers to the new conference, but then-Steelers owner  Art Rooney  initially refused. However, Rooney reconsidered after then-Browns owner  Art Modell  volunteered the Browns to shift to the AFC, partly because the NFL had offered $3 million as an incentive to move but also on account of the potential for an  intrastate rivalry  with the AFL's newest team, the  Cincinnati Bengals . Not only were the Bengals in the same state as the Browns, but they had been established by Browns founder  Paul Brown , whom Modell had a lingering feud with. The financial boost combined with the prospect of losing his most lucrative division rival quickly persuaded Rooney to join Modell in the AFC in order to continue their own rivalry, although the team did lose its  rivalry  with the cross-state  Philadelphia Eagles  as a result. Somewhat ironically, although they play in the same state as the Browns, like the Browns, the Bengals  currently view the Steelers as their biggest rival .

97_1	CAR_b9ca9b833efbf3b2228d6f14930b9679d414f932	In 2005, the Steelers hoped to make another post-season run. Injuries to  Jerome Bettis  and  Duce Staley  caused  Willie Parker  to become the Steelers' starter at running back, and he acquitted himself very well in two convincing wins against the  Tennessee Titans  (34–7) and  Houston Texans  (27–7) to open the season. In the next game, however, the visiting  New England Patriots  handed  Ben Roethlisberger  his first regular-season loss as the Steelers lost the much-hyped rematch of the 2004 AFC Championship Game 23–20. Two weeks later, Pittsburgh came back to defeat the throwback-clad  San Diego Chargers  24–22 on a 40-yard field goal by  Jeff Reed . The victory proved costly as Roethlisberger suffered an injury when he was hit on his left knee by the helmet of Chargers rookie lineman  Luis Castillo . So  Tommy Maddox  was named starter for their home game against the  Jacksonville Jaguars . The Steelers struggled throughout the game, as Maddox threw two interceptions through regulation, but they managed to tie at 17 going into OT. Maddox threw an interception to Jags DB  Rashean Mathis , who returned it 41 yards for a touchdown, as the Steelers fell, 23–17. Maddox's off-field arguments with head coach  Bill Cowher  cost him his No. 1 back-up spot. Roethlisberger was able to play in their next road game against their division rival, the  Cincinnati Bengals . Despite winning 27–13, his left knee needed surgery. Roethlisberger fought through a lot of pain in the Steelers' 20–19 Monday Night victory over the Baltimore Ravens but reaggravated his knee injuries.  Charlie Batch  was named the starter, and he provided victories over the struggling  Green Bay Packers  (20–10 on the road), and against their rust belt rival, the  Cleveland Browns  (34–21 at home), where during the game, wide receiver  Hines Ward  set the Steelers record for most career receptions (543), breaking John Stallworth's mark of 537. Batch broke his hand, which sent him to the sidelines. Tommy Maddox was given the start for their road game against the Ravens, but again, he showed his inefficiency, as the Steelers fell in overtime 16–13. After Roethlisberger's return, the Steelers lost their first two games against the then-undefeated  Indianapolis Colts  (26–7 on the road) and at home against the resurgent Bengals (38–31), but recovered to win the last four regular-season games (21–9 vs.  Bears , 18–3 @  Vikings , 41–0 @ Browns, and 35–21 vs.  Lions ) to clinch the sixth and last seed in the AFC playoffs.

The two teams were realigned into separate divisions for the  2002 NFL season , however matchups are still considered heated between the two teams.

From that season, through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions but remained in the same conference for three years. Finally, in 1970, the Steelers (along with the  Cleveland Browns  and  Baltimore Colts ) moved to the  American Football Conference  while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the  National Football Conference . As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year. Currently they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season, with the most recent meeting being in 2016 at Philadelphia, where the Steelers lost and have lost nine straight games dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the  Super Bowl  era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 47–28–3.

With 128 meetings and counting, it is the oldest rivalry and the most storied in the  American Football Conference , surpassing any other rivalry in the conference by at least 5 games. The two divisional foes have a natural rivalry due to the commonalities between the cities, proximity, etc. It is sometimes called the Turnpike Rivalry or Turnpike War  because the majority of the driving route between the two cities are via the  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio Turnpike s.

However, the Oilers became a contender in the latter part of the decade and challenged the Steelers to division and conference supremacy. Unlike other rivalries such as the one between the Steelers and Browns that was based on the close proximity between the two teams and was more fan-driven, the rivalry between the Steelers and the Oilers/Titans franchise was driven on personal hatred between the two teams, much like the concurrent  rivalry  the Steelers had with the  Oakland Raiders  or the  rivalry  with the  Baltimore Ravens  decades later.

Ravens head coach  John Harbaugh  later agreed with this assessment. The Ravens and Steelers met three times again in the  2010 NFL season , with the Ravens winning the first game and the Steelers winning the last two, including the divisional playoff game. On the opening Sunday of the  2011 NFL season , the Ravens forced seven turnovers and routed the Steelers 35–7 at M&T Bank Stadium to avenge their divisional playoff loss to the Steelers from January. During Week 9 of the season, the Steelers were on the verge of winning their game against the Ravens at Heinz Field. The Steelers were ready to potentially increase their lead with a 47-yard field goal kick by  Shaun Suisham , but a five-yard delay of game penalty put them out of field goal range and they instead decided to punt the ball to the Ravens. In the end,  Joe Flacco  threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver  Torrey Smith  in the end zone with just eight seconds remaining, giving the Ravens the win and a season sweep of the Steelers. This would also be the last time Ravens linebacker  Ray Lewis  would play against the Steelers, as he was injured during the teams' two meetings in 2012 and retired following his win in  Super Bowl XLVII .

The Steelers agreed to be one of them after their archrivals, the  Cleveland Browns , volunteered to join the AFL franchises in the AFC. The Browns mainly joined because of the possibility of an intrastate rivalry with the AFL's  Cincinnati Bengals  (now known as the  Battle of Ohio ), largely due to the animosity at the time between Browns owner  Art Modell  and Bengals owner & coach  Paul Brown , who was fired from the Browns by Modell after the 1962 season. The Steelers joined the AFC in order to keep the  Browns-Steelers rivalry  alive on a regular basis, due to the proximity of the cities of  Pittsburgh  and  Cleveland .

Steelers starting QB  Ben Roethlisberger , who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss to the  Chiefs  did not start, and was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup  Charlie Batch  also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB  Dennis Dixon , who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR  Santonio Holmes  on a play-action pass for a 33 yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball. The ball was kicked 20 yards towards the Steelers endzone by a Pittsburgh player, but recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by  Lawrence Timmons  and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession, things were looking bad when the offense was facing a 3rd and 22 with around 3 minutes left. Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17 yards, leaving John Harbaugh with a critical decision. Harbaugh opted to go for it, and Joe Flacco found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10-yard line with less than 2 minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. A very good punt return into Steeler territory by  Chris Carr  was wiped off by a block in the back. Despite the setback, the Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40-yard line, where their drive stalled. On 3rd and 9 with 25 seconds left, Joe Flacco was sacked and fumbled, but the ball was recovered by Ben Grubbs. With the clock counting inside 10 seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56 yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2 yards short. In overtime, the Steelers won the toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40-yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB  Paul Kruger , who returned the ball 26 yards to the Steeler 28-yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11-yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.

97_2	CAR_5bc0065f64d708ac788da67edf73a58aa9530549	Controversy erupted during the third quarter of the Thanksgiving night game between the Steelers and Ravens, as Steelers head coach  Mike Tomlin  found himself in the path of Ravens returner  Jacoby Jones  during a Ravens kickoff return. Tomlin was watching the play on the stadium's big screen and was thus facing away from the play itself while standing with at least one foot in the field of play. Jones broke the return to the side of the field and was running up the sideline on which Tomlin was standing. Tomlin stepped away from the field to avoid Jones as he approached, but did so only after he caused Jones to veer slightly toward the center of the field. Shortly thereafter, Jones was tackled from behind at the Steelers' 27 yard-line. Some observers speculated that without Tomlin's interference Jones may have reached the endzone on the play. Tomlin was fined $100,000 by the league for the incident and the league held out the possibility that the Steelers might also be stripped of draft picks in the  2014 NFL Draft  since Tomlin's actions "affected a play on the field." After the season concluded it was announced that no further penalty beyond Tomlin's fine would be assessed.

The rest of the season was an uneven string of wins and losses, which included a home victory over Pittsburgh in overtime followed by a Monday Night loss in  Green Bay . That game was notable for the huge number of penalties committed, costing a total of 310 yards, and almost tying with the record set by  Tampa Bay  and  Seattle  in  1976 . Afterwards, the Ravens easily crushed the  Lions  and  Bears , giving up less than ten points in both games. The next match was against the  Steelers , where Baltimore lost a close one before beating the  Raiders  to end the season.

In the playoff game, a personal foul by special teams player  Daren Stone  cost the Ravens 25 yards. The game's last score was an interception that was returned for a touchdown by  Troy Polamalu , sealing a 23–14 victory for Pittsburgh.

He had a great season playing on special teams and  nickelback  for the top ranked  Baltimore  defense.  His best game was against the  Steelers  where he had an interception, a sack, and a forced fumble that was recovered for a touchdown by  Adalius Thomas  in a win. It was also his first game back from a  kidney  injury against the  Denver Broncos  which he was told would end his season but he only missed 2 games. His injury earned him the  Ed Block Courage Award .  The injury is well documented because on the plane ride back from Denver the Ravens had to make an emergency stop for Ivy in Pittsburgh. During an interview with BaltimoreRavens.com after receiving the award Ivy said that FS  Ed Reed  was the person who got the doctor while on the plane. Ivy followed that with a strong 2007 but in 2008, the final year of his contract, Ivy saw his role decrease. Following the season, The Ravens let several veteran corners go, including Ivy. But Ivy's first stint with the  Baltimore Ravens  was arguably the most successful stay of his career.

In Pittsburgh, it is considered the  spiritual successor  to the  Browns–Steelers rivalry  due to the  Cleveland Browns relocation controversy  as well as the "reactivated" Browns having a poor record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999. Due to its physical nature, it has received comparisons to the rivalry the Steelers had with the  Oakland Raiders  in the 1970s, when those two teams were among the most physical teams in the league.  Both teams have also handed each other their first loss in their current stadiums; the Steelers handed the Ravens their first loss at PSINet Stadium (now  M&T Bank Stadium ) in 1998, while the Ravens  returned the favor  by handing the Steelers their first loss at  Heinz Field  in 2001.

In the next game, however, the visiting  New England Patriots  handed  Ben Roethlisberger  his first regular-season loss as the Steelers lost the much-hyped rematch of the 2004 AFC Championship Game 23–20. Two weeks later, Pittsburgh came back to defeat the throwback-clad  San Diego Chargers  24–22 on a 40-yard field goal by  Jeff Reed . The victory proved costly as Roethlisberger suffered an injury when he was hit on his left knee by the helmet of Chargers rookie lineman  Luis Castillo . So  Tommy Maddox  was named starter for their home game against the  Jacksonville Jaguars . The Steelers struggled throughout the game, as Maddox threw two interceptions through regulation, but they managed to tie at 17 going into OT. Maddox threw an interception to Jags DB  Rashean Mathis , who returned it 41 yards for a touchdown, as the Steelers fell, 23–17. Maddox's off-field arguments with head coach  Bill Cowher  cost him his No. 1 back-up spot. Roethlisberger was able to play in their next road game against their division rival, the  Cincinnati Bengals . Despite winning 27–13, his left knee needed surgery. Roethlisberger fought through a lot of pain in the Steelers' 20–19 Monday Night victory over the Baltimore Ravens but reaggravated his knee injuries.  Charlie Batch  was named the starter, and he provided victories over the struggling  Green Bay Packers  (20–10 on the road), and against their rust belt rival, the  Cleveland Browns  (34–21 at home), where during the game, wide receiver  Hines Ward  set the Steelers record for most career receptions (543), breaking John Stallworth's mark of 537. Batch broke his hand, which sent him to the sidelines. Tommy Maddox was given the start for their road game against the Ravens, but again, he showed his inefficiency, as the Steelers fell in overtime 16–13. After Roethlisberger's return, the Steelers lost their first two games against the then-undefeated  Indianapolis Colts  (26–7 on the road) and at home against the resurgent Bengals (38–31), but recovered to win the last four regular-season games (21–9 vs.  Bears , 18–3 @  Vikings , 41–0 @ Browns, and 35–21 vs.  Lions ) to clinch the sixth and last seed in the AFC playoffs.

The two teams met again at M&T Bank Stadium in Week 16 for their second meeting of the season. The Ravens started  Ryan Mallett  in the game since Joe Flacco had suffered a season-ending injury several weeks before. Despite being big underdogs due to injuries and a subpar record, the Ravens were able to complete a sweep of the Steelers with a 20–17 victory.

Ravens head coach  John Harbaugh  later agreed with this assessment. The Ravens and Steelers met three times again in the  2010 NFL season , with the Ravens winning the first game and the Steelers winning the last two, including the divisional playoff game. On the opening Sunday of the  2011 NFL season , the Ravens forced seven turnovers and routed the Steelers 35–7 at M&T Bank Stadium to avenge their divisional playoff loss to the Steelers from January. During Week 9 of the season, the Steelers were on the verge of winning their game against the Ravens at Heinz Field. The Steelers were ready to potentially increase their lead with a 47-yard field goal kick by  Shaun Suisham , but a five-yard delay of game penalty put them out of field goal range and they instead decided to punt the ball to the Ravens. In the end,  Joe Flacco  threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver  Torrey Smith  in the end zone with just eight seconds remaining, giving the Ravens the win and a season sweep of the Steelers. This would also be the last time Ravens linebacker  Ray Lewis  would play against the Steelers, as he was injured during the teams' two meetings in 2012 and retired following his win in  Super Bowl XLVII .

Steelers president  Art Rooney II  publicly supported the Ravens, due to both teams being division rivals and showing how good the  AFC North  is. In nearby  Youngstown, Ohio , where the DeBartolo-York family that owns the 49ers resides and which the Steelers share with the  rival   Cleveland Browns  for territorial rights, the area was more decisively in favor of the 49ers winning, both in support of the DeBartolo-York family as well as lingering resentment towards  Art Modell  for  moving the original Cleveland Browns to Baltimore  in 1996. Earlier in the season, the 49ers also practiced at  Youngstown State University  in between road games on the East Coast.

On a hot, humid day in M&T Bank Stadium, crowd noise and multiple Steelers mistakes allowed Baltimore to crush them with 3 TDs 35–7. The frustrated Pittsburgh players also committed several costly penalties. Thus, the Ravens had gained their first ever victory over the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger playing and avenged themselves of repeated regular and postseason losses in the series.

This meant that they held the first loss of the season, breaking a record for the most points allowed by the defense and ending a 75-game streak of holding a .500 or better win-loss ratio. They would rebound in Week 2 with a 14–6 victory over their division rival, the  Cleveland Browns . The following week the Ravens took on the unbeaten Houston Texans at home; this time they would face a familiar face in safety Ed Reed, who played for them for 12 seasons.

In Week 16 the Ravens would lose at home to the New England Patriots 41-7 making it the second worst home loss in Ravens history. In Week 17 the Ravens faced the Cincinnati Bengals. The defense forced 4 interceptions on Andy Dalton but it wasn't enough for the offense to take advantage of. Baltimore tied the game 17-17 in the second half, but surrendered 17 unanswered points to the Bengals, thus ending their season at 8-8 and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2007.

In the first quarter, Cincinnati delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback  Carson Palmer  found offensive tackle  Andrew Whitworth  on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  In the second quarter, the Steelers answered with safety  Troy Polamalu  returning an interception 45 yards for a touchdown; followed by kicker  Shaun Suisham  nailing a 23-yard field goal.

After being voted team captain for the second consecutive year, he opened the 2002 season with 7 tackles and 1 tackle for a loss in a victory over  Auburn . The Trojans faced number 18 Colorado in week 2 and Polamalu had a team-high 11 tackles. His performance in the 40–3 blowout over Colorado won him Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week. In the fifth game of the season, he injured his ankle on the first defensive series against number 17  Washington State . After sitting out a game, he returned against #22 Washington and racked up 5 tackles and returned an interception 33-yards. Polamalu then disrupted Stanford for the third year in a row, accumulating a season-high 13 tackles, 2 tackles for a loss, and 1 sack. He played his last college game in the  Orange Bowl  against number 3 Iowa. A hamstring injury sidelined him for the majority of the game. Polamalu finished his senior season with 68 tackles, 9 tackles for a loss, 3 sacks, 1 interception, and 3 forced fumbles. He was voted a first team All-American by the Associated Press, Football Writers, ESPN.com, and Walter Camp, making him the first Trojan to be a 2-time first-team All-American since  Tony Boselli  in 1992.

Much like the  Pittsburgh Penguins  would do with the site of Civic Arena, the Steelers retained development rights to the site of Three Rivers, and would later build  Stage AE  on portions of the site, as well as an office building that hosts the studios for  Root Sports Pittsburgh , the headquarters of  StarKist Tuna , and the regional headquarters of  Del Monte Foods . On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the  Immaculate Reception , the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where  Franco Harris  made the reception in the parking lot. In 2015, the  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  moved into a new office building also built on a portion on the site after 53 years in the former  Pittsburgh Press  building and more than two centuries in Downtown.

In a game that was mostly dominated by defense, the contest remained scoreless throughout the entire first half.  On the opening drive of the second half, Pittsburgh drove 67 yards to take a 3-0 lead on  Roy Gerela 's 18-yard field goal.  Following two Raiders drives that were shut down by  Jack Ham 's interception and a fumble recovery by  Glen Edwards ,  Steelers defensive back  Mike Wagner  fell on a fumble by quarterback  Ken Stabler  (who had replaced injured starter  Daryle Lamonica  earlier in the game) at the Oakland 35.  Five plays later, Gerela kicked a 29-yard field goal that gave Pittsburgh a 6-0 lead in the fourth quarter.  Stabler responded by leading his team 80 yards to score on a 30-yard touchdown run with 1:13 left in the game.

This is the third such monument that commemorates the play in the city with the other two located at the  Pittsburgh International Airport  and the  Heinz History Center .

Stabler first attracted attention in the NFL in a 1972 playoff game against the  Pittsburgh Steelers . After entering the game in relief of  Daryle Lamonica , he scored the go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter on a 30-yard scramble. The Steelers, however, came back to win on a controversial, deflected pass from  Terry Bradshaw  to  Franco Harris , known in football lore as the  Immaculate Reception .

After the game he indicated that from his view the football had indeed touched Tatum. Although a few days later Madden indicated that the Raiders game films showed that the ball hit Fuqua's shoulder pads, Jack Tatum conceded that "even after we viewed the game films with stop action, nobody could tell who the ball hit on that moment of impact." Years later Madden wrote, "No matter how many times I watch the films of the 'immaculate reception' play, I never know for sure what happened."

Roethlisberger led the Steelers against the  Indianapolis Colts , the NFL's top team throughout the season and a heavy favorite to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XL. Roethlisberger threw for 197 yards and recorded a game-saving tackle on Colts' defensive back  Nick Harper , who had just recovered a  Jerome Bettis   fumble  with less than two minutes left in the game. Pittsburgh led early but had to survive a Colts comeback to win 21–18, after an errant call that the NFL later admitted was a mistake, which overturned a  Troy Polamalu  interception that would have secured the game for the Steelers. Roethlisberger's tackle on Harper, dubbed by many as The Tackle II or The Immaculate Redemption, was compared by many to " The Immaculate Reception " in 1972, when  Franco Harris  made a miraculous reception and scored the game-winning touchdown against the  Oakland Raiders . The victory marked the first time in playoff history that a sixth-seeded NFL playoff team defeated the top-seeded team.

The story begins in Art Rooney's office at  Three Rivers Stadium  where he is preparing for a dinner at the local  Knights of Columbus  hall.  He then begins to converse with the audience, where he reminisces about his youth, and how he formed the Steeler franchise.

He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the first round of the  1971 NFL Draft , and with them earned a reputation as a fierce competitor and one of the hardest hitters ever to play the game.

97_6	CAR_3a2d0ff00740a6d83b64864a13967070bbeff13a	Harris was a key player in one of professional football's most famous plays, dubbed " The Immaculate Reception " by Pittsburgh sportscaster  Myron Cope . In a 1972 playoff game, the  Oakland Raiders  were leading the Steelers 7-6 with 22 seconds to play when a  Terry Bradshaw  pass was deflected away from intended receiver  John "Frenchy" Fuqua  right as defender  Jack Tatum  arrived to tackle Fuqua. Harris snatched the ball just before it hit the ground and ran it into the endzone to win the game. The Raiders challenged the touchdown, claiming that Fuqua had handled the ball before Harris, which would invalidate the score because at that time it was against the rules for two offensive receivers to touch the ball. The Steelers maintained that the ball had touched Tatum instead. According to a recounting by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the film of the play is inconclusive. Raiders linebacker  Phil Villapiano  attempted to criticize Harris's achievement by stating that he was only in position to catch the ball because he was lazy, but replays show that Harris headed downfield when the Raiders forced Bradshaw out of the pocket, and can be clearly seen running before catching the deflected ball.
97_6	CAR_3a7fe71ea657e54de495090bf7ecea10b2baa0d1	In 2004 John Fetkovich, an emeritus professor of physics at  Carnegie Mellon University , analyzed the NFL Films clip of the play. He came to the conclusion, based on the trajectory of the bounced ball and conservation of momentum, that the ball must have bounced off Tatum, who was running upfield at the time, rather than Fuqua, who was running across and down the field. Fetkovich also performed experiments by throwing a football against a brick wall at a velocity greater than 60 feet per second, twice the speed Fetkovich calculated that Bradshaw's pass was traveling when it reached Tatum and Fuqua. Fetkovitch achieved a maximum rebound of 10 feet when the ball hit point first, and 15 feet when the ball hit belly first, both less than the 24 feet that the ball actually rebounded during the play. Timothy Gay, a physics professor and a longtime Raiders fan, cited Fetkovich's work with approval in his book The Physics of Football, and concluded that "the referees made the right call in the Immaculate Reception."

The bitter rivalry started with the Steelers' first playoff win over the Raiders by way of  Franco Harris 's  Immaculate Reception  on December 23, 1972. The two teams met in the  playoffs  for five consecutive seasons (1972–76) and is regarded as one of the most bitter rivalries in the history of professional sports. Oakland leads the series 15–13.

The Pittsburgh Steelers featured the " Steel Curtain " defense and a powerful running attack led by  Franco Harris  and  Rocky Bleier , but Bradshaw's strong arm gave them the threat of the deep pass, helping to loosen opposing defenses. In  1972 , he threw the " Immaculate Reception " pass to Franco Harris to beat the Raiders in the AFC Divisional playoffs, which is among the most famous plays in NFL history.
97_6	CAR_4b32d4a48054f78e6e4cd7851f041332f3433acd	1972 was the year before the team's 40th year in the league, during which they had finished above .500 only nine times, and until then had never won a playoff game. In fact, before this game, the only playoff game the team had ever played was a loss to the  Philadelphia Eagles  in  1947  after the two teams finished tied for the  Eastern Division  championship. The Immaculate Reception was actually the first touchdown the Steelers ever scored in the postseason (they were shut out against the Eagles in the 1947 playoff game). (The Steelers also lost to the  Detroit Lions  in the 1962  Playoff Bowl , though this was considered an  exhibition game  between the two second place teams in league record books and not an actual playoff game.) They had long been regarded as one of the league's doormats (as the 1944 Card-Pitt merger was 0–10 and was ridiculed as the "Carpitts," a play on the word "carpet"). As recently as 1969 the team had posted a 1–13 record, thus securing the first draft choice in the subsequent NFL draft (in which the Steelers chose Terry Bradshaw) and seeding their remarkable turnaround. Since the  AFL-NFL Merger , the Steelers have the NFL's best record (surpassing Miami in  2007  because of the Dolphins' recent struggles), have had a league-low three head coaches, and have had only nine losing seasons,  none worse than 5–11 . Only twice since the Immaculate Reception has the team had losing seasons two years in a row and none three years in a row.

The Associated Press  ran an article stating "Welcome to NFL immortality, Joe Flacco," and compared his 70-yard touchdown pass to  Roger Staubach 's  Hail Mary  and  Franco Harris 's  Immaculate Reception .   ESPN  analyst and former quarterback  Ron Jaworski  said, "That was certainly one of the most remarkable throws in Ravens history and one of the best throws I've ever seen."  According to ESPN Stats & Information’s win probability model, Denver had a 97.2 percent chance of winning the game prior to the touchdown.  Retiring linebacker Ray Lewis said of Flacco, "He grew up today," and noted that before the game he had told his quarterback, "'You're the general now.  Lead us to victory.  You lead us today.  I'm just here to facilitate things.'"  Flacco threw for 331 yards and three touchdowns, with no interceptions and a fumble that he lost.
97_6	CAR_4ca34118457f817b8478319661bed7b9fa7edeb0	Like other famous plays in the NFL, this play has been given nicknames, but largely due to two separate, unique occurrences in the play, consensus was not reached on a single name for some time. In 2009, readers of the  New York Daily News  voted on nicknaming the play "Catch-42" as the favored name in reference to Super Bowl XLII and the kind of coverage the Patriots deployed against the Giants' four-receiver set. Since then, David Tyree has adopted the "Catch-42" nickname as well as  ESPN.com . Other proposed nicknames include "The Escape and the Helmet Catch", "The E-mmaculate Connection" (a pun on the  Immaculate Reception ; the 'E' standing for Eli), "The Double Miracle", and "The Reception that Ended Perfection". "The Great Escape" was used by  U.S. President   George W. Bush  during the Giants'  White House  visit. "David and Eliath" was also suggested by David Tyree due to  biblical  reference.   Bill Simmons  named it "The Helmet Catch" five days after the game, and as time passed by, this became the consensus name for the play.

Cope figured out an innocuous way to introduce the phrase on air, prefacing the remark by saying, "It comes from a good Christian lady." WTAE-TV and its channel 4 logo was immortalized in the 1979  basketball  comedy film  The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh , whose fictional sportscaster Murray Sports (played by  Harry Shearer ) was also patterned after Cope.

There are no longer any restrictions on any deflections of passes, and a future play that mirrored the Immaculate Reception would simply be an extraordinary but legal reception. Whether a future Franco Harris would have been ruled as catching such a deflected football before it struck the turf is a different matter, thanks to myriad cameras and use of instant replay that is part of the present-day NFL.

However, official  Fred Swearingen  (the referee of the  Immaculate Reception  game of 1972) called Barnes for pass interference.

The teams met in the playoffs in each of the next four seasons, starting with the Raiders' 33–14 victory in the 1973 divisional playoffs. Pittsburgh used the AFC championship game victories over Oakland (24–13 at Oakland in 1974 and 16–10 at Pittsburgh in 1975) as a springboard to victories in  Super Bowl IX  and  Super Bowl X , before the Raiders notched a 24–7 victory at home in 1976 on their way to winning  Super Bowl XI . To date, the two last met in the playoffs  in 1983  when the eventual  Super Bowl champion  Raiders, playing in Los Angeles at the time, crushed the Steelers 38–10. The rivalry has somewhat died off in the years since, mainly due to the Raiders on-field struggles since appearing in  Super Bowl XXXVII .

With 22 seconds left in the game, Steelers  quarterback   Terry Bradshaw  threw a pass to running back  John "Frenchy" Fuqua . Tatum collided with Fuqua, knocking the ball into the air.  The ball fell into the hands of Steelers running back  Franco Harris , who ran it 42 yards for the game-winning touchdown. The play is famous because NFL rules at the time prohibited a receiver from batting the ball to another player of the same team. The referees ruled that Tatum had touched the ball and therefore Harris's touchdown was permitted, allowing the Steelers to win the game.

Immediately Jansante led the team in receptions, but he needed only 10 to earn that distinction in 1946. A year later, in 1947, he set club records with 35 catches for 599 yards and 5 touchdowns, leading the Eastern Division in receiving until the last game of the season.  That was the first year the Steelers went to a postseason game, with an 8-4 record.  It would be their only postseason competition until  Franco Harris ' “ Immaculate Reception ” of 1972. Jansante broke his mark in 1948 with 39 receptions for 623 yards. In addition, he led the Steelers in pass receptions in 1949 and 1950.

97_6	CAR_9f4e06a488f700d1f37df4a42411c3a7375cd16f	The  Pittsburgh Steelers ' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been very tight; as of the 2015 season the Raiders lead the rivalry 12 wins to 11, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3–3.  The rivalry was extremely intense during the 1970s. The Steelers knocked the Raiders out of the playoffs in three of four consecutive seasons in the early 1970s (the first loss was the " Immaculate Reception " game) until the Raiders finally beat the Steelers in the 1976  AFC Championship  (and went on to win  Super Bowl XI ). During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety  George Atkinson  delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver  Lynn Swann  that gave him a concussion. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson hit Swann again and gave him another concussion. After the second incident, Steelers head coach  Chuck Noll  referred to Atkinson as part of the "criminal element" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2 million  defamation  lawsuit against Noll and the Steelers, which he lost. The two clubs' three most recent contests harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close competition.  On December 6, 2009 the 3–8 Raiders helped spoil the  defending champions ' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in the fourth quarter and a  Louis Murphy  touchdown with 11 seconds to go won it 27–24 for the Raiders.  Oakland was then beaten 35–3 by Pittsburgh on November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 1970s history when Steelers quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  was punched by Raiders defensive end  Richard Seymour  following a touchdown. Most recently, on November 8, 2015 the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38-35 victory.  During the game the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver Antonio Brown to catch 17 passes for 284 yards.  Both are Steelers team records and the 284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history.

Originally nicknamed the Pirates, the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to represent the city's heritage of  producing steel . The Steelers' first season with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff game in 1947. In 1969, the Steelers hired head coach  Chuck Noll  who strategically drafted players in order to improve the team. Three years later, in the first playoff game at  Three Rivers Stadium  Pittsburgh's rookie running back  Franco Harris  returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the  Immaculate Reception . In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by  Bill Cowher , who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005.

Throughout their 31 seasons in Three Rivers Stadium, the Steelers posted a record of 182–72, including a 13-5 playoff record, and defeated every visiting franchise at least once from the stadium's opening to close, enjoying perfect records there against seven teams. The Steelers sold out every home game from 1972 through the closing of the stadium, a streak which continues through 2008. The largest attendance for a football game was on January 15, 1995, when 61,545 spectators witnessed the Steelers lose to the  San Diego Chargers . On December 23, 1972, Three Rivers Stadium was site to the  Immaculate Reception , which became regarded as one of the greatest plays in NFL history. Three Rivers Stadium hosted seven  AFC Championship Game s from 1972 to 1998; the Steelers won four. In the  1995 AFC Championship game , the Steelers'  Randy Fuller  deflected a  Hail Mary pass  intended for  Indianapolis Colts  receiver  Aaron Bailey  as time expired, to send the franchise to their 5th Super Bowl. A Steelers symbol recognized worldwide, The  Terrible Towel  debuted on December 27, 1975 at Three Rivers Stadium. The Steelers would move to  Heinz Field  after it was closed.

That season the Raiders achieved a 10–3–1 record and an AFC West title. In the divisional round, they were beaten by the  Steelers  13–7 on a play that become known as the " Immaculate Reception ". The Raiders won the AFC West again in  1973  with a 9–4–1 record. Lamonica was replaced as starting quarterback early in the season by  Ken Stabler , who remained the starting quarterback throughout the team's dominant seasons of the 1970s.

It occurred in the  AFC   divisional playoff game  of the  National Football League  (NFL), between the  Pittsburgh Steelers  and the  Oakland Raiders  at  Three Rivers Stadium  in  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , on December 23, 1972. With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game, Pittsburgh quarterback  Terry Bradshaw  threw a  pass  attempt to  John Fuqua . The ball bounced off the hands of Raiders safety Jack Tatum and/or Fuqua and, as it fell toward the ground, Steelers fullback  Franco Harris  scooped it up and ran for a game-winning  touchdown . The play has been a source of unresolved controversy and speculation ever since, as many people have contended that the ball touched either Fuqua or the ground before Harris caught it, either of which would have resulted in an  incomplete pass  by the rules at the time. Kevin Cook's The Last Headbangers cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL's most controversially physical era.

Raiders defensive back  Jack Tatum  knocked it away, but it was scooped up at ankle-height before hitting the turf by  Franco Harris , who took it into the end zone for the winning touchdown and a 13–7 victory. In the AFC Championship the following week, the Steelers lost 21-17 to the "perfect"  Miami Dolphins , who finished the season 17–0.

During the season, Greene tallied eleven  quarterback sack s and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the  AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year .  Miami Dolphins  head coach  Don Shula  lauded Greene, saying, "He's just a super super star. It's hard to believe he isn't offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him." By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. "We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro," said Greene in 1972. "I'm just like all the other guys, doing my best in a team effort."With the drafting of defensive tackle  Ernie Holmes  in 1972, the Steelers assembled what became known as the " Steel Curtain " defensive line of Greene, Holmes,  L. C. Greenwood , and  Dwight White . Greene was invited to the  Pro Bowl for 1973 , joining White and Greenwood on the  American Football Conference  (AFC) roster.

97_8	CAR_25a133bc63d5220ea2d3e2634086fdd123e2e840	The Steelers excelled on defense and led the NFL in fewest points (13.9) and yards (237.2) allowed per game, while also ranking second in sacks with 51.  Up front, their line was anchored by defensive end  Aaron Smith , who recorded 60 tackles and six sacks.  Behind him two of the Steelers starting linebackers ranked among the top-ten sack leaders in the NFL,  LaMarr Woodley  (11.5 sacks) and Pro Bowler/NFL Defensive Player of the Year  James Harrison  (16 sacks).  Pro Bowl linebacker  James Farrior  was also a big contributor, recording 3.5 sacks and leading the team with 133 tackles.  The Steelers secondary was led by pro bowl safety  Troy Polamalu , who ranked second in the NFL with a career-high seven interceptions.

Each year, the rivalry was escalating: in  1972 , the Steelers  won  in Pittsburgh; in  1973 , the Raiders returned the favor in Oakland. However, the Steelers were ready for anything the Raiders could throw at them. Using the new "Stunt 4-3 defense" the Steelers held the Raiders to 29 yards rushing as the Steelers themselves ran for over 200 yards in Oakland. After a Franco Harris touchdown run, the Steelers clinched their first Super Bowl appearance in club history (and their first league championship appearance).
97_8	CAR_28db9feb5c3ce6ab29a039e806c7cf0ab76de46e	In 1974, the Steelers won the first of six consecutive  AFC Central  division championships and also their first  Super Bowl .  Perles became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers in 1978 and then assistant head coach under Noll in 1979. During Perles' ten years with Pittsburgh (1972–1982), the Steelers won a then-record four Super Bowls and became known as the team of the decade for the 1970s, largely on the back of their "Stunt 4-3" defense designed by Perles. This defense used Joe Greene in an angled stance with Jack Lambert stacked behind him. With Greene's talent and stunts it kept Lambert free from blockers to seemingly make every tackle.
97_8	CAR_2e7ec366339c4712ad00a848b3db71d070b6db7e	Richardson played only five games with the Steelers in , registering two tackles, plus another on special teams.  Part of the problem was that the Steelers played a  3-4 defense , and Richardson didn't have the build to play defensive end in that scheme.  The Steelers made him an  inside linebacker , and he didn't make the adjustment very well.  Following the 1991 season, long-time head coach  Chuck Noll  retired and was replaced by  Bill Cowher , who tried to switch Richardson to outside linebacker (his position for the first three years of his collegiate career).  When that didn't work, Cowher asked player development director  Tom Donahoe  if it was too soon to cut him.  When Donahoe said he should keep the top forty-seven players regardless of their draft history, Richardson was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round draft pick; if a trade had not been possible, Richardson would have simply been waived.  After four uneventful games with the Redskins, he was released and signed with the New York Jets.  At the end of the  season, after seven games with the Jets, Richardson's short NFL career was over.
97_8	CAR_4241eaa04dd449e3e75954b08ecfe6dc2b5068a8	The Steelers finished 9–7 in 1990 led by the No. 1 defense in the NFL in terms of yards allowed. The defense was led by the secondary (mainly the superb  Rod Woodson ) which was particularly effective limiting opposing passers to just 9 touchdown passes while intercepting 19 (the Steelers intercepted 24 total as a team). The 1990 season ended with another disappointment however as the Steelers lost twice in three weeks to the  Cincinnati Bengals , and lost the season's final game on the road to the  Houston Oilers  to miss out on the playoffs.
97_8	CAR_470920958a595830e74d795f0e08db6ddcef2318	It took Bradshaw several seasons to adjust to the NFL, but he eventually led the Pittsburgh Steelers to eight  AFC Central  championships and four Super Bowl titles. The Pittsburgh Steelers featured the " Steel Curtain " defense and a powerful running attack led by  Franco Harris  and  Rocky Bleier , but Bradshaw's strong arm gave them the threat of the deep pass, helping to loosen opposing defenses. In  1972 , he threw the " Immaculate Reception " pass to Franco Harris to beat the Raiders in the AFC Divisional playoffs, which is among the most famous plays in NFL history.
97_8	CAR_4b1cbb1285f3f0b1fc595141f387a387f5244cc3	During the game, the Steelers' defense forced 4 turnovers (1 interception, 3 lost fumbles) in retaliation for their 8 turnovers during their 20–14 loss at Cleveland when the Browns' defense got 3 interceptions and 5 lost fumbles.  This brings the Steelers' yearly total of turnovers against the Browns to 5 in both games (2 interceptions, 3 lost fumbles). Heinz Field's turnout of 51,831 fans was the smallest for a Steelers game since their current stadium's opening in 2001.
97_8	CAR_4c44672eaf3bf71f453d14652bc30394cdab0509	After a turnover, the Steelers scored the first points on a  Jeff Reed  37-yard field goal.   Brian Westbrook  left the game with an ankle injury early in the second quarter, but  Correll Buckhalter  finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown catch.  The touchdown was the 176th for  Donovan McNabb , surpassing  Ron Jaworski  on the franchise list.  The Philadelphia defense began to take over at this point, sacking Roethlisberger six times in the quarter.  A fumble recovery by  Brodrick Bunkley  after a sack led to a  David Akers  field goal.  Pittsburgh would end the half with Reed kicking a 53-yard field goal to make it 10–6.  Without Westbrook, the Eagles' offense struggled to score, but the defense continued to shut down the Steelers.  An intentional grounding penalty on Roethlisberger from his own end zone resulted in a safety.  A diving sack and fumble recovery by  Brian Dawkins  led to a field goal and sealed the win, giving the Eagles a 15–6 lead.  The defense sacked Roethlisberger and  Byron Leftwich  nine times, forced two fumbles, and intercepted a pass.  Punter  Sav Rocca  also contributed to the second-half shutout with his punts.  The Eagles improved to 2–1 with the win.
97_8	CAR_4e37344fe531ea7732c59209ad3a3491362fa876	In Week 2 of the  2014 NFL season , the Ravens beat the Steelers 26–6 at M&T Bank Stadium, which marked the first time since 2011 that the Steelers did not score a touchdown in a game. In Week 9, the Steelers defeated the Ravens 43–23 at Heinz Field. Unlike the typical, close games of the rivalry, each team beat the other by 20 points at their respective home fields in the season. At halftime during the Week 9 game, the Steelers retired Jersey No. 75 in honor of defensive tackle  Joe Greene , who had helped lead the legendary " Steel Curtain " defense of the 1970s. Though the Steelers went on to win the AFC North with an 11–5 record in the 2014 season, the 10–6 Ravens would earn their first playoff victory over their rival on January 3, 2015, with a 30–17 win at Heinz Field in the Wild Card round.
97_8	CAR_545e18602de8651570d1102b90a2d1934ade98d2	The  1978  Pittsburgh Steelers season was the  franchise 's 46th season in the  National Football League  (NFL). The season concluded with the team winning  Super Bowl XIII  to become the first franchise in the NFL to win three  Super Bowl  titles.  The championship run was led by  quarterback   Terry Bradshaw  and the team's vaunted  Steel Curtain  defense.  Bradshaw put together the best year of his career to that point, becoming only the second Steeler to win the  NFL MVP award .  Ten Steelers players were named to the  Pro Bowl  team, and four were judged as first-team  All-Pros  by the AP.  Head coach  Chuck Noll  returned for his tenth season—moving him ahead of  Walt Kiesling  as the longest tenured head coach in the  team's history  to that point.
97_8	CAR_581cf993e5425bf6bcf3d5b3a4604bb4a8918540	In 2007,  ESPN.com  named the 1976 Steelers the greatest defense in NFL history, noting, "the 1976 unit was the best (slightly better than the  '75 squad ). Here's why: 28. That's how many points the Steel Curtain surrendered in the last nine games of the season. That's a total. As a result, Pittsburgh, which started the season 1–4, made it all the way to the  AFC Championship Game .... The '76 Steelers didn't have it easy – their opponents had a .528 winning percentage. But they had these guys: Hall of Famers  Mean Joe Greene ,  Jack Lambert ,  Jack Ham  and  Mel Blount . And eight Steelers defensive players made the  1976 Pro Bowl  team: cornerback  J.T. Thomas , defensive end  L.C. Greenwood , Greene, Ham, Lambert, defensive back  Glen Edwards , safety  Mike Wagner , and Blount."

The Ravens would creep closer as McGahee rushed for a 1-yard touchdown.  However, in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh pulled away as safety  Troy Polamalu  returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown.  Baltimore tried to mount a comeback, but the Steelers' defense was too much to overcome.
97_8	CAR_63f1b34d8c28c87b82fc7396951afaaa9d5452f1	After a tough loss to the Jets, the Steelers traveledto Titans Stadium to take on the Titans.  In the first quarter, the Steelers scored first when Shaun Suisham kicked a 49-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  They increased their lead as William Gay picked off Zach Mettenberger and returned it 28 yards for a TD for a 10-0 lead.  The Titans finally got on the board when Bishop Sankey ran for a 9-yard TD for a 10-7 game.  However, the Steelers pulled away as Suisham kicked another field goal from 23 yards out for a 13-7 lead.  In the 2nd quarter, it was all Titans when Ryan Succop kicked a 20-yard field goal to come within 3, 13-10.  They eventually took the lead when Mettenberger found Nate Washington on an 80-yard TD pass and led the game 17-13 at halftime.  After the break, the Titans went back to work in the 3rd quarter with Mettenberger finding Chase Coffman on a 4-yard TD pass for a 24-13.  In the 4th quarter, the Steelers staged a comeback when Le'Veon Bell ran for a 5-yard TD to come within 4, 24-20.  Then Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 12-yard TD pass later on in the quarter to retake the lead 27-24.  The defense was able to hold off the Titans offense and recovered the onside kick with less than 2 minutes remaining, sending the Steelers to 7-4 going into their bye week.

97_8	CAR_66f42fbbd6305551d23fa83086a2f9c50af0753b	The defending champions began the 2009 campaign in good form, winning six of their first eight matches. However, a major loss came as the Steelers lost Troy Polamalu in Week 1 against the Tennessee Titans. Troy came back in Week 6 against the Browns and played until Week 10 against the Bengals when he reinjured himself in the game. This effectively ended the rest of Troy's season. But starting in Week 10, things crumbled as Pittsburgh dropped five in a row, including losses to Kansas City and Oakland, two of the league's weakest teams. The ultimate disaster came in Week 14, when an unprepared, injury-compromised Steelers team lost to the 1–11 Cleveland Browns for the first time since 2003. Pittsburgh managed to snap its losing streak in the next game, where they beat Green Bay by one point with Ben Roethlisberger throwing a career-best 504 passing yards. They then won against Baltimore the following week, and on the season ender defeated Miami to finish 9–7. However, the Ravens' victory over Oakland later that day kept Pittsburgh from the playoffs. Throughout the season, the Steelers struggled harshly on special teams, giving up four kickoff return touchdowns. The Steelers sent 4 players to the Pro Bowl: Tight end Heath Miller (76 receptions, 789 receiving yards, and 6 touchdowns), nose tackle Casey Hampton (43 tackles/23 solo, and 2 sacks), and linebackers James Harrison (79 tackles/60 solo, 10 sacks, and 5 forced fumbles) and LaMarr Woodley (62 tackles/50 solo, 13 sacks, and 1 forced fumble).

First, Banaszak tackled fullback  Robert Newhouse  for 4-yard loss. Next, linebacker  Jack Ham  tackled Dorsett for a 3-yard loss on an attempted  sweep . On third down, defensive tackle  Joe Greene  sacked Staubach, forcing a fumble that bounced through the hands of Steelers' defensive lineman  Steve Furness . Cowboys lineman  Tom Rafferty  eventually recovered at the Dallas 13-yard line.  Theo Bell  then returned  Danny White 's ensuing 38-yard punt 3 yards to the Dallas 48-yard line.
97_8	CAR_6acfa1301338d8771cd4f8a2fd12c7b450919eea	The  Pittsburgh Steelers  have used the 3–4 as their base defense since  1982 , the season after  Hall of Fame  defensive tackle  Joe Greene  and end  L. C. Greenwood  retired. In fact, the Steelers were the only NFL team to use the 3–4 defense during the  2001 NFL season , but finished the season as the number one defense in the NFL. It is believed that the Steelers success with the 3–4 defense is the primary reason why many NFL teams have started returning to the formation.

Up front, linemen  Joe Greene  and  L.C. Greenwood  terrorized opposing quarterbacks and rushers. And linebackers  Jack Lambert  and  Jack Ham  excelled at run stopping and pass coverage, combining for 8 interceptions. The Steelers also had a fine secondary, led by defensive backs  Mel Blount , who recorded 3 interceptions, and  Donnie Shell , who had 5.

But in the fourth quarter, the Ravens took advantage of another key special teams play when  Mitch Berger 's punt went just 21 yards to the Baltimore 42-yard line. Flacco then led the Ravens 58 yards, completing 4 of 4 passes for 44 yards on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by McGahee, cutting their deficit to 16–14. Baltimore's defense subsequently forced a punt and got the ball back on their own 14-yard line with just over six minutes left in the game. But four plays later, safety  Troy Polamalu  intercepted a pass from Flacco, ran all the way across the field, and took off for a 40-yard touchdown return, making the score 23–14. Pittsburgh then put the game away by forcing two more turnovers on the Ravens next two drives. First, a hit by  Ryan Clark  on McGahee forced a fumble that was recovered by linebacker  Lawrence Timmons ; McGahee suffered a concussion and was removed from the field on a stretcher. Then after a punt,  Tyrone Carter  intercepted a pass from Flacco with less than a minute left in the game.
97_8	CAR_71ed7fc6d6da727737e614b8cb20a017096ea41f	The rivalry became more competitive and fierce and reached a new height of intensity during the  2008 NFL season , when the Steelers and Ravens played three times, the final match being the AFC Championship.  The Steelers won all three games, by close margins. In Week 15, the Steelers won with a controversial score late in the game.  In the playoff game, a personal foul by special teams player  Daren Stone  cost the Ravens 25 yards. The game's last score was an interception that was returned for a touchdown by  Troy Polamalu , sealing a 23–14 victory for Pittsburgh. In that same game the Steelers'  Ryan Clark  delivered a concussion-inducing, but legal hit on the Ravens'  Willis McGahee  that left Clark briefly out cold and forced McGahee to spend the night in a Pittsburgh hospital. The Steelers went on to win  Super Bowl XLIII  against the  Arizona Cardinals .
97_8	CAR_7a59e002e2f8bf4cd142b25740c9e8c6fb894e3d	In the 2010 season opener against the  Atlanta Falcons , Polamalu made a possible game-saving interception with 1:45 left in the game. The Steelers went on to win in overtime. In week 13 of 2010, Polamalu made a game-changing play against the Baltimore Ravens by forcing a fumble with a sack to set up a 9-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Redman with 2:51 left to give the Steelers a 13-10 victory. In week 14 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Polamalu cut in front of intended receiver  Terrell Owens  to intercept a  Carson Palmer  pass and returned it 45 yards for a touchdown. Polamalu re-injured an ankle on this interception, but stayed in the game. He recorded another interception later in the game. He missed the next two games with an ankle injury but returned for the last game of the season against the Cleveland Browns. In that game, he intercepted  Colt McCoy  before being pulled from the game when the Steelers were leading by over 30 points. It gave him his 7th interception of the year.

97_8	CAR_7c4367c854ed5c8a346c4f15ba183b62f19229f8	The Steelers defense ranked fourth in the NFL, giving up 284.0 total yards per game. The Pittsburgh defense was led by its  linebacking  corps:  Joey Porter ,  James Farrior ,  Clark Haggans , and  Larry Foote . Porter led all NFL linebackers with 10.5  quarterback sack s and also recorded two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Haggans tallied nine sacks and 40 tackles, while Farrior added a team-high 119 tackles to go with his two sacks and one fumble recovery. In the secondary,  free safety   Chris Hope  led the team with three interceptions, while Pro Bowl safety  Troy Polamalu , the team's top threat in the defensive backfield, notched 91 tackles, three sacks, two fumble recoveries, and two interceptions.

While the  Steel Curtain  held down the Colts, the offense stalled out in a cold and wet  Three Rivers Stadium . They turned the ball over five times. But an interception by CB Mel Blount gave a chance for the Steelers to take over. After a Rocky Bleier, #20, touchdown, a fumble recovery by LB #34 Andy Russell looked to seal the game. However, it wasn't before Andy took the ball on what  Sports Illustrated  called "the longest slowest touchdown ever witnessed". The Steelers won, 28-10, and prepared for their rival,  the Oakland Raiders . Like last year, the Steelers would play the  AFC Championship  against them, however, this time in the comfort of Three Rivers and the ice. All week the weather was awful in Pittsburgh, after the field tarp split during the night, the sidelines became iced over and narrowed the field for the deep outside passing game of Oakland. The teams scored a total of 3 points in the first three quarters. Both teams combined for 13 turnovers. The most heated rivalry was stuck in a deep-freeze. It had been escalating for four years, and now it was escalating on every play. During the 3rd, #88 Lynn Swann was taken out of the game by a clothesline tackle from Raiders S #43  George Atkinson . He had been knocked out and later, was in the hospital. In the 4th quarter, the Steelers scored on a 25-yard run to the outside by #32 Franco Harris. It was a play in which John Stallworth made a key block on two Raider defenders. Later, a 20-yard pass caught by Stallworth put them up, 16-7. The game ended on a #12  Ken Stabler  pass to #21  Cliff Branch , who was tackled down by CB #47  Mel Blount . The Steelers were headed to the  Super Bowl  again.
97_8	CAR_8043620c9902242e04ef04e6b617790145076902	The 3–4 defense generally uses four defensive backs. Two of these are safeties, and two of them are cornerbacks. A cornerback's responsibilities vary depending on the type of coverage called. Coverage is simply how the defense will be protecting against the pass. The corners will generally line up 3 to 5 yards off the line of scrimmage, generally trying to "Jam" or interrupt the receivers route within the first 5 yards. A corner will be given one of two ways to defend the pass (with variations that result in more or less the same responsibilities): zone and man-to-man. In zone coverage, the cornerback is responsible for an area on the field. In this case, the corner must always stay downfield of whomever it is covering while still remaining in its zone. Zone is a more relaxed defensive scheme meant to provide more awareness across the defensive secondary while sacrificing tight coverage. As such, the corner in this case would be responsible for making sure nobody gets outside of him, always, or downfield of him, in cases where there is no deep safety help. In man coverage, however, the cornerback is solely responsible for the man across from him, usually the offensive player split farthest out.
97_8	CAR_812f48295ba97ec33ce759b94943b43dc8c443b2	There was some good to the Steelers 2009 season.  They were able to beat four eventual playoff-bound teams; the Green Bay Packers, the Minnesota Vikings, the Baltimore Ravens, and the San Diego Chargers.   The Steelers offense gained 369.2 yards a game (263.1 coming through the air, and 106.1 coming on the ground.)  The Steelers defense only allowed their opponents to compile 305.5 average yards per game, and allowed only an average of 89.3 yards a game on the ground.  Ben Roethlisberger was able to set team passing records in the following categories: completion percentage, completions, attempts, and yards.  The Steelers defense compiled 47 sacks, and the team finished with 41 total touchdowns and 3 defensive touchdowns.

Baltimore delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback  Joe Flacco  found wide receiver  Anquan Boldin  on a 14-yard touchdown pass.  After a scoreless second quarter, the Steelers responded with kicker  Shaun Suisham  got a 45-yard field goal.  The Ravens would answer with a 24-yard field goal from kicker  Billy Cundiff .  Pittsburgh would get another field goal in the fourth quarter, a 19-yarder by Suisham. In the final minutes of the game, the Ravens were driving, trying to run down the clock, when  Troy Polamalu  sacked Flacco, forcing a fumble in the process. The Steelers recovered the fumble and returned it to the Ravens' 9-yard line. Two plays later, quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to running back  Isaac Redman . Baltimore tried to rally, but the Steelers' defense held on to preserve the win.
97_8	CAR_832a229ab745a0eea4a155050ec4b926a53f4ab8	The Steelers defense had another stellar outing, sacking Joe Flacco five times and forcing two turnovers. Michael Vick threw for 124 yards and a score and avoided committing any turnovers while starting in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger.

C. Greenwood . Pittsburgh managed a 6–3 record nonetheless in 1982 (which was shortened due to a players' strike) and made it to the playoffs for the first time since 1979. In the playoffs they lost when  Kellen Winslow  caught two touchdowns in the 4th quarter of their first playoff game, a 31–28 loss to the  San Diego Chargers .

97_8	CAR_8eff010ad46608b0fbba44f77674e92627df144d	For the first time ever, the Super Bowl matched two teams that had already won  Lombardi Trophies . Most the pre-game hype was centered on the health of Lynn Swann, who was given the worst  concussion  he had ever had. A statement made by Cowboys safety  Cliff Harris  had angered Swann. Swann was not the only Steeler who was challenged.  The Cowboys  scored quickly on a 29-yard pass to #88  Drew Pearson . The defense had allowed the first 1st quarter touchdown on the Steelers all year. However, a determined Lynn Swann made a leaping sideline catch over Cowboys CB #46  Mark Washington . Later, he made the catch that is often repeated by  NFL Films  as one of the greatest catches in  NFL History . Bradshaw threw it deep to Swann who was covered very well by Washington again. However, when the ball was batted it, it began to fall. As the ball and Swann was falling, he was able to stick his hands up and grab it with Washington underneath him. At the end of the first half, the Cowboys were leading 10-7. The Steelers defense was very challenged by the complicated Cowboy offense. However, the Cowboys had never seen a defense quite like the Steelers. Roger Staubach was sacked 7 times for a loss of 42 yards. When the third quarter resumed, Cowboys' safety #43 Cliff Harris began to taunt Steelers kicker #10,  Roy Gerela . LB #58  Jack Lambert , seeing this, ran over and threw Harris to the ground. It was a crucial moment in the game, as a huge momentum shift. S #23  Mike Wagner 's interception helped the Steelers to their first lead. As usual, they saved their best for last. However, a long touchdown catch by Lynn Swann had come to a cost, as Bradshaw was shaken up and forced to leave the game. A  Dallas  touchdown cut their lead to 4. When #5  Terry Hanratty  took over, Chuck Noll made an unusual decision. On 4th and 9, the Steelers ran the ball up the middle, giving the ball back to the Cowboys near mid-field. However, it was the faith he had in his defense that caused this decision. With three seconds left, the Cowboys had one last chance, and threw a pass into the endzone. However, it was tipped by Mike Wagner and intercepted by S #27  Glen Edwards . The Steelers were Super Bowl champions again. They had beaten the Cowboys, 21-17. The MVP of course, was #88 Lynn Swann. At the end of the game, Chuck Noll began to preparing his team in the locker room of the  Miami Orange Bowl  for the next year.

He, along with the other members of the Steel Curtain, appeared on the cover of  Time  magazine in December 1975, a rare tribute. After leading the Steelers to another Super Bowl win after the 1975 season over the  Dallas Cowboys  in  Super Bowl X , Greene missed the first several games of the  1976 season  with a back injury. The Steelers started off the season 1–4 and looked like they would not make the playoffs. Quarterback  Terry Bradshaw  was also injured and was replaced by rookie  Mike Kruczek . Greene returned and the Steelers defense carried the team to nine-straight wins and the playoffs. With a defense considered one of the best in NFL history, the 1976 Steelers held opponents to an average of less than 10 points per game (138 points over 14 games). During their nine-game winning streak, the Steelers defense recorded five shutouts, including three straight, and surrendered a total of 28 points (roughly 3 points per game). The defense allowed only two touchdowns over nine games. The Steelers were defeated by Oakland in that year's AFC Championship Game.
97_8	CAR_92eeac04870971384b7d17602e9d06cc826d0358	Entering the 2008 season, the Pittsburgh Steelers lost  Alan Faneca , after his contract expired and he signed with the  New York Jets . The Steelers also signed quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  to an eight-year, $102 million contract, the largest in franchise history. The Steelers also drafted  Rashard Mendenhall , running back from Illinois, with the 23rd overall pick in the  2008 NFL Draft  as well as top wide receiver prospect  Limas Sweed  of Texas with the 53rd overall pick. With injury to  Willie Parker  and uncertainty about his future production, Mendenhall was drafted to be the next Steelers running back of the future. The regular season went well with the team winning twelve games and losing four, all to strong opponents, with their only losses going to the  Philadelphia Eagles , the  New York Giants , the  Indianapolis Colts , and the  Tennessee Titans  (who had the best record in the league). The team thus earned a first-round bye and home advantage through the playoffs.  James Harrison  was voted as the 2008 AP Defensive Player of the Year with a monstrous regular season performance with 16 sacks (fourth in league) and 7 forced fumbles (first in the league).  Troy Polamalu  also had a great season, gaining seven interceptions which was tied for second in the league, trailing only  Ed Reed  of the  Baltimore Ravens  who had 9. Beating San Diego in the divisional round, they faced their AFC North rival Baltimore in the conference championship and soundly defeated them. Thus, the Steelers made it to their seventh Super Bowl. Their opponent was the  Arizona Cardinals , a team that had not appeared in any league championship since 1948.

He debuted professionally in Week 1 (September 11) against the  Baltimore Ravens  on  special teams . In Week 2 (September 18), Allen and  Arnaz Battle  made a special teams tackle of the  Seattle Seahawks '  Leon Washington  during a third quarter  kickoff  return. On October 23 (Week 7) against the  Arizona Cardinals , Allen made his first defensive tackle. Allen made four defensive tackles on October 30 (Week 8) against the  New England Patriots  and was part of a defense that limited  Tom Brady  to 198 passing yards. In Week 9 (November 6) against Baltimore, Allen made three defensive and one special teams tackle. Allen left the Week 17 (January 1, 2012) game against the  Cleveland Browns  due to a shoulder injury. He did not return to that game and was inactive for the Steelers'  Wild Card  game. Allen finished his rookie season with 15 tackles. He regularly played on  nickel  and  dime  defenses. Defensive coordinator  Dick LeBeau  commented about Allen: "We always liked his size to speed ratio and he's got an innate feel for the ball."
97_8	CAR_940c7f822263f5a819f3225ddd4542fbec117547	Bell started in all 16 games for the Steelers during his 2001 rookie campaign.  He was an excellent fit for the Steelers defense, most likely because of his blitzing abilities.  The Steelers finished the regular season with a 13-3 record, earning them the top seed in the AFC.  Bell was voted the  AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year .  The Steelers defeated their division rival, the  Baltimore Ravens , 27-10 in the AFC Divisional round at Heinz Field.  The following week they went on to face the second seeded  New England Patriots .  Bell recorded 8 tackles, a sack, and 2 passes defended.  Despite his stellar performance, and a late 4th quarter comeback, the Steelers wound up losing the game 24-17.  In 2002, Bell was injured in week 1 of the AFC Championship Game rematch versus New England.  He missed the next 4 games, but returned in week 7 to face the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night.  He finished the season with 50 tackles, (33 less from his rookie year), and 4 sacks.  The Steelers finished with a 10-5-1 record, and went on to face the  Cleveland Browns .  In an epic 36-33 comeback win over the Browns, Bell recorded 9 tackles but injured his knee in the final quarter and was listed as doubtful for the following week at Tennessee.  Although hurt, Bell started the game against the second seeded Titans.  He recorded only 2 tackles before leaving the game once again with an injury.  The Steelers lost 34-31.  In 2003, Bell amassed 99 tackles and 5 sacks despite the Steelers poor 6-10 finish.  In 2004, Bell injured his knee yet again, and would not see the field until week 9.  He played 3 games for the Steelers before he re-injured his knee in week 11 versus Cincinnati.  In the 2005 off-season, the Steelers, (who went 15-1 in the regular season without Bell), released him from the team.

Pittsburgh trailed early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback  Carson Palmer  completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to offensive tackle  Andrew Whitworth .  The Steelers took the lead in the second quarter with safety  Troy Polamalu  returning an interception 45 yards for a touchdown, followed by a 23-yard field goal from kicker  Shaun Suisham .
97_8	CAR_96f41d58f984ea9008d4d36f52c99538d86c26c4	The 1982 offseason was the start of a slow transition period for the team, as the defensive line was hit with key retirements in  "Mean Joe" Greene  and  L. C. Greenwood . Partially due to the team losing two key players and partially due to the need to go up against a more wide-open NFL, head coach  Chuck Noll  switched from the traditional  4–3  defensive alignment (four lineman & three linebackers) to the  3–4  (three lineman & four linebackers). The Steelers would more than make a good transition to the 3–4, as many teams have since tried to copy the Steelers success with the 3–4 alignment, especially since  2001 , when the Steelers were the only team in the NFL with the alignment but led the league in defense.
97_8	CAR_9b4c7102d2f9f2af56401c005e48d59b8536ecc4	The Steelers defense forced 5 turnovers and held the vaunted Packers running game to less than 100 yards. The offense gained more total yards than the Packers. The improved play kept  Pittsburgh in the see-saw game but it wasn't enough. Jefferson shined again by catching 7 passes for 167 yards and two scores.  The Steelers could not find a solution for the Packers Carroll Dale, who had similar statistics. The Packers Travis Williams had a spectacular game, scoring two touchdowns on a punt return and a kickoff return. Bart Starr sat out more than half the game, nursing a sore shoulder, but came into the game in relief of Dan Horn to lead the Packers.
97_8	CAR_a19de52f0d783e04d11cccdae6fd9eb0b61fc569	Steelers linebacker  James Harrison  had three sacks, forced a fumble and recovered another. Safety  Troy Polamalu  was credited for an interception and an impressive leaping tackle on Kerry Collins during an attempted goal-line stand by the Steelers to win the game and improve to 2–0.
97_8	CAR_a34560bcd71268f7dccac4261350ff9d020cf7e5	The Steelers opened up their regular season on the road against their old AFC North division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens scored quickly on their first drive, when only three plays into the game, Baltimore wide receiver Anquan Boldin caught a 27-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco. The Ravens scored again on the ensuing drive when running back Ray Rice ran in a 1-yard touchdown, putting Baltimore on top 14–0 early in the first quarter. The Steelers battled back on the next drive, driving down to the Ravens 11-yard line. Pittsburgh scored on a third-and-goal play when wide receiver  Emmanuel Sanders  caught a touchdown in the back of the end zone from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Ravens responded by scoring again, this time on an 11-yard pass from Flacco to Rice. At halftime the Ravens led 21–7, just like in the 2010 playoffs. But unlike that game, the Ravens did not let up their dominance in the second half. On Pittsburgh's first play from scrimmage in the second quarter, Ravens defensive lineman  Haloti Ngata  stripped Roethlisberger of the football and recovered it at the Steelers 18-yard line. The Ravens scored yet again when tight end  Ed Dickson  caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Joe Flacco. A two-point conversion by punter/holder  Sam Koch  put the Ravens on top 29–7. The Ravens never looked back, and put up two more  Billy Cundiff  field goals to close out the game 35–7. The Steelers finished with 7 turnovers in the game. The loss marked the Steelers first opening day loss in 8 years, and left Pittsburgh at the bottom of the division with an 0–1 record.
97_8	CAR_a60271e3928a83347b5da66a3e48fc95aa18c085	In 1993, the first year of free agency, Greene sought out teams that employed a 3-4 system. He visited the Green Bay Packers where his former defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur was employed as the defensive coordinator but they were a 4-3 team. He then visited the Pittsburgh Steelers, a 3-4 team. Dom Capers was the defensive coordinator. He signed a 3-year $5.35 million free-agent contract with the  Pittsburgh Steelers . Returning to his left outside linebacker position, he had a solid season with 12½ sacks which tied him for 7th in the league. The following season, Greene was a consensus  All-Pro  choice in 1994 as he led the NFL in sacks (14) and made another appearance in the Pro Bowl. Additionally, Greene was voted the NFLPA AFC Linebacker of the Year (tied with Junior Seau) for the first time in his career. In 1995 he went to his third Pro Bowl, where he finished with 9 sacks and also played in  Super Bowl XXX , a loss to the  Dallas Cowboys . During Greene's three years with the Steelers defense allowed only 3.48 yards per rush, best in the NFL. As part of that defense, which also led the NFL in sacks with 139 over the same three-year period,  Dick LeBeau  said, "Kevin Greene is a great player against the run and of the best pass rushers in NFL history. He is almost unblockable."
97_8	CAR_ab1149d81addf7b0fe29898b6f4850e0d104d40a	After 2 playoff appearances, the Steelers appeared to be in great shape after finishing the preseason as the only undefeated team in the NFL. After two straight games, the Steelers scored over 50 points and were 1-0-1. However, the Steelers couldn't beat the Raiders at home. Steelers starting quarterback at the time,  Joe Gilliam 's play continually deteriorated. By Week 7, the Steelers were 4-1-1 and Gilliam was benched for Terry Bradshaw during a win against the Falcons. Bradshaw won the next two games, but after a loss in  Cincinnati , Noll benched Bradshaw again. This time he was benched in favor of  Terry Hanratty  (who was selected in the 1969 Draft). Hanratty however, played horribly in  Cleveland . The offense was in a struggle, but the Steelers had won those tough games behind the still maturing  Steel Curtain  defense. When Bradshaw was brought back into the lineup, the Steelers beat the  Browns  and the  Saints  (a game that Bradshaw ran more than he passed). After a loss to  Houston , the Steelers would play the most important game of the season in  New England . With a win against the Patriots, the Steelers would clinch the  AFC Central  and appear in their third straight playoff appearance. But they didn't have to worry. The Steelers dominated them and then beat the  Bengals  and awaited the  playoffs .

Based on the previous season's results, the team faced the most difficult schedule in over 30 years; however, they were called Super Bowl contenders by  ESPN . The Steelers opened their regular season on September 7, with a win over the  Houston Texans  en route to a 12–4 record, and a second straight AFC North Division title. In his second season as head coach  Mike Tomlin  was selected in fan balloting as the Motorola Coach of the Year. Linebacker  James Harrison  was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year after leading a defense which set the standard for the league in nearly every defensive category, including total yardage allowed, points allowed, passing yardage allowed, first downs allowed, yards per play, and yards per pass, among others. The  playoffs  began on January 11, 2009, with a win over the  San Diego Chargers . The following week saw the third victory of the season over the  Baltimore Ravens  in the  AFC Championship  game and the advancement to  Super Bowl XLIII  where the Steelers defeated the  Arizona Cardinals  on February 1, 2009.

The Seahawks entered the game hoping to stop the Steelers running game – while that effort was largely successful the Steelers and quarterback  Terry Bradshaw  won with the passing game.  After a scoreless first quarter, the Steelers took a 14–0 lead which they wouldn't relinquish on a pair of Bradshaw touchdown passes.  Linebacker  Jack Lambert  led the Steelers defense with an interception, a fumble recovery and five solo tackles.

From that season through his last, 1983, the Broncos "Orange Crush" defense allowed the third fewest rushing yards in the NFL, behind only the  Steelers  " Steel Curtain "  defense and the  Cowboys'  "Doomsday" defense. Additionally, the Broncos trailed only the Steelers in the fewest yards per rush during that same span. They have been named one of the NFL's greatest defenses by the  BBC  and others.
97_8	CAR_b2b475569ecfaaf479704839a5dd8386799cabbb	2015 marked a transition period for the Steelers defense, as longtime  defensive coordinator   Dick LeBeau  resigned January 10. A member of the  Pro Football Hall of Fame  due to his 14-year playing career with the  Detroit Lions , LeBeau served 13 seasons as the Steelers defensive coordinator under Tomlin and his predecessor  Bill Cowher  over two stints (1995–1996 and 2004–2014), and whose  zone blitz  defense ranked within the Top 5 in the NFL in total defense in 11 of those 13 seasons. At the time of his resignation, LeBeau was the NFL's longest-active tenured defensive coordinator. LeBeau, 77, mentioned that it was a "resignation, not retirement."
97_8	CAR_b96018989884df9db24de2b5aa0e4353141429b0	The Steelers had one of the league's top defenses, leading the NFL in sacks (48), and fewest points (14.5) and rushing yards (62.8) allowed per game, while ranking second in fewest total yards (276.8).  The line was anchored by pro bowl end  Brett Keisel .  The Steelers also had four excellent linebackers:   LaMarr Woodley ,  James Harrison ,  James Farrior , and  Lawrence Timmons .  For the third consecutive year, Woodley and Harrison each recorded at least 10 sacks.  Woodley also forced three fumbles and Harrison forced six.  Farrior had 109 total tackles and six sacks.  Timmons led the team with 135 total tackles, while also recording three sacks and two interceptions.  The secondary was led by pro bowl safety  Troy Polamalu , who won the  NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award , tying his career-best seven interceptions and returning them for 101 yards and a touchdown.

For the nine games remaining in the season, the Steelers recorded five shutouts (three of them back to back), and only allowed two touchdowns (both in a single game), and five field goals. The defense allowed an average 3.1 points per game and the team had an average margin of victory of 22 points.  Eight of the Steelers' starting eleven defensive players were selected for the Pro Bowl that year, and four would be selected to the Hall of Fame.
97_8	CAR_c3761deaf10af1bb4f1b09731e313e6f784e21db	The 1994 season brought back memories of the 1970s Steeler teams. Barry Foster was joined in the backfield by rookie  Bam Morris , and together they gained almost 1,700 rushing yards. The "Steel Curtain" defense made a resurgence, with  Kevin Greene  responsible for 14 sacks and  Greg Lloyd  tacking on 10 more. The Steelers' 12–4 record clinched them home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. In the divisional playoff Pittsburgh walloped the  Cleveland Browns  29–9, and were heavily favored in the conference championship against the  San Diego Chargers . The Steelers seemed to dominate when the numbers were crunched: O'Donnell passed for 349 yards to  Stan Humphries ' 165, and had a nearly 2–1 edge in time of possession. But they gave up a 13–3 lead in the 3rd quarter when  Alfred Pupunu  and  Tony Martin  caught touchdowns of 43 yards each, and it was the Chargers who advanced to  Super Bowl XXIX , by the score of 17–13. The 1994 Steelers finished their disappointing season three yards away from their first Super Bowl appearance since 1980 as an O'Donnell pass to Foster was batted down. This play epitomized the Steelers' season – incomplete. AFC Championship collapses, unfortunately for the Steelers, would become a hallmark of the Cowher era.

Jamal Lewis was the top rusher of the game, Jermaine Lewis notched 145 yards and a touchdown on special teams, and linebacker Ray Lewis was named Super Bowl MVP. In addition, the Ravens defense was coached by  Marvin Lewis . The Ravens defense has since been considered among the greatest of all time. The Ravens defense became the third to shut-out their opponent in Super Bowl history; the Giants' only points came on a kickoff return. Washington in  Super Bowl VII  scored against Miami only after the late fumble by Garo Yepremian which was returned for a touchdown.  The only points Pittsburgh allowed to Minnesota in  Super Bowl IX  came on the return of a blocked punt.

The secondary was led by Pro Bowl defensive back  Carnell Lake  and  Willie Williams , who led the team with seven interceptions and 122 return yards.  The secondary also featured future Hall of Fame defensive back  Rod Woodson , who missed almost the entire season with a knee injury, but returned in time for the playoffs.  He is still the only NFL player to return from a torn ACL to play in the same season.

On 4th down from the Pittsburgh 40-yard line with 22 seconds left and trailing 7–6, Bradshaw threw a pass intended for  John "Frenchy" Fuqua . Raiders defensive back  Jack Tatum  knocked it away, but it was scooped up at ankle-height before hitting the turf by  Franco Harris , who took it into the end zone for the winning touchdown and a 13–7 victory. In the AFC Championship the following week, the Steelers lost 21-17 to the "perfect"  Miami Dolphins , who finished the season 17–0. It was a disappointing finish, but it started a run of eight straight playoff appearances. Arguably the most defining and memorable play in the history of the NFL, the Immaculate Reception thrust the Steelers into its glory years of the '70s.
97_8	CAR_dad88286bf48d15bcd93b5166255dafd15c1758a	The two-time defending champions got off to a rough start in 1976, losing four of their first five games. The team regrouped and, based on their powerful defense, won their last nine regular season games, five of which were shutouts. For the third consecutive year, a Steelers player (this time  Jack Lambert ) won the AFC Defensive Player of the Year award. Pittsburgh finished 10–4 and blew out the Colts 40–14 in the divisional playoffs. In the AFC Championship, an injury-plagued Steeler team lost 24–7 to their perennial playoff nemeses and eventual Super Bowl champions, the Raiders.
97_8	CAR_ddc52fc0829066567e166ccb99cf47b1c2467fb3	After 2003's failed attempt to focus on the passing game, the 2004 team returned to the typical Steelers formula, a run-heavy offense (61/39 run-pass ratio) and a strong defense. The team's dominant running game, featuring Jerome Bettis and  Duce Staley  (acquired prior to the season in free agency), was bolstered by an efficient and often explosive passing attack led by Roethlisberger and receivers Burress, Ward, and  Antwaan Randle El . The defense, one of the league's best, was anchored by Pro Bowl linebackers  James Farrior  and  Joey Porter  and Pro Bowl safety  Troy Polamalu . Only three previous teams (The '84  49ers , the '85  Bears , & the '98  Vikings ) have had a 15-win season, with the Steelers being the first  AFC  team to accomplish this feat. As a result of this dominant season, the Steelers received  home field advantage  throughout the AFC playoffs.

Greene and coach Noll are widely credited with turning the Steelers franchise around. The Steelers finished  1970  with a 5–9 record and went 6–8 in  1971 . Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl in both seasons. In  1972 , Pittsburgh finished 11–3 and won its first division title and its first playoff game—the " Immaculate Reception " game against the  Oakland Raiders .  During the season, Greene tallied eleven  quarterback sack s and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the  AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year .  Miami Dolphins  head coach  Don Shula  lauded Greene, saying, "He's just a super super star. It's hard to believe he isn't offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him." By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. "We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro," said Greene in 1972. "I'm just like all the other guys, doing my best in a team effort."With the drafting of defensive tackle  Ernie Holmes  in 1972, the Steelers assembled what became known as the " Steel Curtain " defensive line of Greene, Holmes,  L. C. Greenwood , and  Dwight White . Greene was invited to the  Pro Bowl for 1973 , joining White and Greenwood on the  American Football Conference  (AFC) roster.

This was done in order to keep team chemistry with the players, since the team was only one year removed from a  Super Bowl win  at the time of Tomlin's hiring. The Steelers finished Tomlin's first season as head coach with the top-ranked defense in the NFL. Tomlin led the  Steelers  to the 2007 AFC North Division championship and a 10–6 record in his first year as head coach. The Steelers lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Jacksonville Jaguars, 31–29. Tomlin began his career with a 15–7 record in regular season play—as did his predecessor Cowher and all-time win-leader  Don Shula . Tomlin set a Steelers record for most wins, after winning 22 games in his first two seasons as head coach; in addition he became the first Steelers coach to win division titles in his first two seasons.

The Steelers-Cowboys is to date the Super Bowl matchup with the most contests.  The Steelers won  Super Bowl X  and  Super Bowl XIII ; both games were decided in the final seconds, first on a last-second throw by  Roger Staubach , then as a fourth-quarter rally by Dallas fell short on an  onside kick . The Cowboys won  Super Bowl XXX  in January 1996. It is said that the rivalry was fueled in the 1970s due to the stark contrast of the teams: the Cowboys, being more of a "flashy" team with  Roger Staubach 's aerial attack and the "flex"  Doomsday Defense ; while the Steelers were more of a  "blue-collar"  team with a strong running game and the 1970s-esque  Steel Curtain  defense, a contrast that still exists today. In addition, both teams have national fan bases rivaled by few NFL teams, and both come from areas with a strong following for football at all levels. Dallas leads the all-time series 16–15 including the playoffs.

Both were strong on defense with the Steelers' famed  Steel Curtain  defense, called a "Stunt 4-3", while the Cowboys boasted the  Doomsday Defense , based around Landry's "Flex" 4-3 defense. On the offensive side of the ball brought key differences, as the Cowboys had Hall of Fame  quarterback   Roger Staubach  and his aerial attack, as well as his reputation for fourth-quarter comebacks, earning him the nickname "Captain Comeback". The Steelers meanwhile, were powered offensively by the running game, led by Hall of Fame  running back   Franco Harris .

In the first quarter, it was all Steelers as Shaun Suisham scored 2 38-yard field goals for 3-0 and 6-0 leads.  In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers would increase their lead when William Gay picked off Matt Ryan and returned the interception 51 yards for a TD for a 13-0 game.  The Falcons finally got on the board when Ryan found Devin Hester on a 17-yard TD pass to shorten the lead to 13-7.  Le'Veon Bell would wrap up the scoring before halftime with a 1-yard run for a 20-7 halftime lead.  In the 3rd quarter, it was all Falcons as Matt Bryant kicked 2 field goals:  from 28 and 22 yards out to shorten the lead to 20-10 then 20-13.  The Steelers however managed to pull away in the 4th quarter when Bell ran for a 13-yard TD for a 27-13 game.  The Falcons tried their hand at coming back when Ryan found Roddy White on a 4-yard TD pass for a 27-20 game.  With minutes left, the Steelers recovered the onside kick and moved down the field.  Ben Roethlisberger took knees to end the game with that final score.

Afterwards, they avenged themselves by shutting out Seattle 24–0. Next Pittsburgh fought a hard battle with the  Peyton Manning -less Colts in Indianapolis and managed to squeak past them with a last second  Shaun Suisham  field goal 23–20. With injuries piling up, the Steelers came out flat against Houston and lost 17–10 in Week 4. Ben Roethlisberger was sidelined with a foot injury and Charlie Batch scheduled to start in Week 5 against Tennessee, however Roethlisberger played and threw for 5 touchdowns in a 38–17 win. After easily winning that game, he returned to action as Pittsburgh beat Jacksonville at home 17–13 and then won in Arizona 32–20 for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLIII. The Steelers set a franchise record in the latter half of the game as Roethlisberger threw a 95-yard TD pass to  Mike Wallace . The next week, Pittsburgh returned home to face  Tom Brady  and the New England Patriots. In a spectacular defensive effort, in which Pittsburgh held Brady to a season-low 198 yards passing, the Steelers beat the Patriots 25–17. Then after a disappointing home loss to Baltimore, the Steelers went to Cincinnati and won their first AFC North division battle of the year, 24–17. After a bye, the Steelers came out flat once again in Kansas City, but managed to beat the Chiefs 13–9. They regrouped and routed the Bengals at home 35–7 the following week.

In a 2010 study, they concluded that "there are not (and will never be) too many people for the planet to feed" according to  The Independent . Some critics warn, this will be at a high cost to the Earth: "the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decades...[however] the environmental cost of what Paul R. and Anne H. Ehrlich describe as 'turning the Earth into a giant human feedlot' could be severe. A large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further  deforestation , loss of  species ,  soil erosion , and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production." Since we are intimately dependent upon the living systems of the Earth, some scientists have questioned the wisdom of further expansion.

In 2013, he wrote with Daniel Kammen and Vincenzo Atella a perspective article on the beneficial role of efficient use of  energy  and  food  in promoting human, environmental, and planetary health, and  sustainable economic development . Fontana and colleagues believe that it is possible to "substantially enhance human and environmental health, societal wealth and  well-being , but this requires a profound transformation in the way we live, and a new environment-centered industrial and economic system". They argue that most of the  knowledge  and  technology  to transform the world and begin a new  industrial revolution  already exist today. We only need to relinquish the idea of "producing more energy, food, and other products at lower cost in favor of a new paradigm that opts for less but high-quality energy, food and materials for a healthier life and environment". Fontana thinks that it is essential to  educate  people and the next generation of  health professionals  about the importance of "reducing calorie intake by increasing the consumption of a variety of minimally processed plant foods and by significantly reducing the intake of  animal source foods "; interventions that will result in "a significant increase in healthspan and reduction of health care costs,  environmental pollution ,  soil erosion ,  water pollution  and shortage,  CO2  production and  global warming ". Fontana, Atella & Kammen also claim that “both individual and  societal wealth ,  happiness , and well-being do not depend merely on the acquisition of  material goods  and on  economic growth , but are powered by our physical and  psychological  health, the  quality of life  and the richness of our  social relationships , and foremost by the health of the environment that supports all  life  on  earth , our Natural Capital that must be preserved”.

The drivers for this are historic, functional, economic, environmental, moral and political. Jatropha oil has been used in India for several decades as biodiesel for the diesel fuel requirements of remote rural and forest communities; jatropha oil can be used directly after extraction (i.e. without refining) in diesel generators and engines. Jatropha has the potential to provide economic benefits at the local level since under suitable management it has the potential to grow in dry marginal non-agricultural lands, thereby allowing villagers and farmers to leverage non-farm land for income generation. As well, increased Jatropha oil production delivers economic benefits to India on the macroeconomic or national level as it reduces the nation's fossil fuel import bill for diesel production (the main transportation fuel used in the country); minimising the expenditure of India's foreign-currency reserves for fuel allowing India to increase its growing foreign currency reserves (which can be better spent on capital expenditures for industrial inputs and production). And since Jatropha oil is carbon-neutral, large-scale production will improve the country's carbon emissions profile. Finally, since no food producing farmland is required for producing this biofuel (unlike corn or sugar cane ethanol, or palm oil diesel), it is considered the most politically and morally acceptable choice among India's current biofuel options; it has no known negative impact on the production of the massive amounts grains and other vital agriculture goods India produces to meet the food requirements of its massive population (circa 1.1 Billion people as of 2008). Other biofuels which displace food crops from viable agricultural land such as corn ethanol or palm biodiesel have caused serious price increases for basic food grains and edible oils in other countries.

For example,  hydroponics  uses ten to twenty times less land and ten times less water than conventional agriculture, while eliminating chemical pesticides, fertilizer runoff, and carbon emissions from farm machinery and long distance transport. Using a building's waste heat and solar photo voltaic panels reduces fossil fuel emissions that typically result from production and distribution.

Many unripe green bananas are culled and thrown out as unsuitable for sale or export. These culled green bananas are still suitable for banana flour production and, if used for this purpose, would significantly reduce waste in banana production. Thus banana producers will be able to secure greater profits from their crops, the environmental impact of those crops would be reduced, and world food production would be increased as a once wasted food stuff would now be utilized. Chilean officials have started production of an overripe banana flour made from overripe banana peels and the overripe banana fruit. This reduces waste by utilizing bananas typically thrown out when unsold or accidentally over ripened, which can occur to as much as 20% of bananas brought to market. In these ways, banana flour can reduce waste on both ends of banana crop production.

For example, a  DEFRA  report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at  AEA Technology  Environment, entitled The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development, included findings that "the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion." The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place. Also, the positive environmental effects of  organic farming  may be compromised by increased  transport ation, unless it is produced by local  farm s.  The  Carbon Trust  notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.
98_1	CAR_74ae1d96e624fd807fd2b4b82fd04a7e7d608de1	However, conventional food systems are largely based on the availability of inexpensive  fossil fuels , which is necessary for  mechanized agriculture , the manufacture or collection of chemical  fertilizers , the processing of food products, and the packaging of the foods. Food processing began when the number of consumers started growing rapidly. The demand for cheap and efficient calories climbed resulting in nutrition decline. Industrialized agriculture, due to its reliance on economies of scale to reduce production costs, often leads to the compromising of local, regional, or even global  ecosystems  through fertilizer runoff,  nonpoint source  pollution, and  greenhouse gas emission . Also, the need to reduce production costs in an increasingly global market can cause production of foods to be moved to areas where economic costs (labor, taxes, etc.) are lower or environmental regulations are more lax, which are usually further from consumer markets. For example, the majority of salmon sold in the United States is raised off the coast of Chile, due in large part to less stringent Chilean standards regarding fish feed and regardless of the fact that salmon are not indigenous in Chilean coastal waters. The globalization of food production can result in the loss of traditional food systems in  less developed countries , and have negative impacts on the  population health , ecosystems, and  cultures  in those countries.
98_1	CAR_7536768cfe8fcc2bdc539dd99cd7416b990b39ac	A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces  carbon output , caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy. Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage,  nutrient cycling , fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications. Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable  growing season . Thus,  seasonal food  farming does not require energy intensive  greenhouse  production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors. Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.  Farmers' market s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local  community-supported agriculture  (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods. Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.

Some proponents of meat-eating argue that the current mass demand for meat has to be satisfied with a mass-production system, regardless of the welfare of animals. Less radical proponents argue that practices like well-managed  free-range  rearing and the consumption of hunted animals, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could satisfy the demand for mass-produced meat. Reducing the worldwide massive  food waste  would also contribute to reduce meat waste and therefore save animals. Indeed, according to the  Food and Agriculture Organization  of the  United Nations , about a third of the food for human consumption is wasted globally (around 1.3 billion tons per year).

The mix of changing environmental conditions and the growing population of urban regions, according to UN experts, will strain basic sanitation systems and health care, and potentially cause a humanitarian and environmental disaster.
98_1	CAR_92e413a7dd18a3e0e2f125d8e458d79edefc524d	Agriculture, as implemented through the method of farming, imposes external costs upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare. A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million. Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society. In 2010, the  International Resource Panel  of the  United Nations Environment Programme  published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that "[a]gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. "On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020)."

As such, using plant-derived foods is typically considered better for the interests of the environment. Despite this, the raising of certain animals can be more environmentally sound than others. According to the Farralones Institute's report from 1976, raising  rabbit s, and  chicken s (on a well-considered approach) for food can still be quite sustainable. As such, the production of meat and other produce, such as eggs, may still be considered environmentally friendly (if this is done in an industrial, high-efficiency manner). In addition, raising goats (for goat milk and meat) can also be environmentally quite friendly and has been favored by certain environmental activists, such as Mohandas  Gandhi .
98_1	CAR_ac7d3f3a5d201c1db91d2493bf2798223df38354	Multiple studies have looked at the environmental impact of conventional agriculture versus the local food movement. These studies show that there is not yet a consistent methodology for measuring energy consumption in local versus non-local farms. “Local” is not a clearly defined measurement, and by only examining the energy in terms of “food miles” versus an entire life cycle assessment (LCA), much of the research on local farming is missing key components of the farm-to-consumer process, and the energy consumption involved. For example, despite the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from transporting farm foods to consumers, agricultural soils are also responsible for releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (Schlesinger).The life cycle assessment attempts to measure the impacts of each activity directly or indirectly involved in the production, transport, storage, retail, consumption and disposal of a particular food from “farm to fork” or “farm to waste”. Studies that examine the LCA still show that there is no clear conclusion on the environmental impact of local versus non-local agriculture. A study in Sweden that examined bread production using local flour versus flour from other regions in Sweden found that the smaller scale of local farms results in less energy efficiency5.  Another study supports this argument that global food systems have better energy efficiency due to the size of production, the so-called “ecology-of-scale”. Both of these studies are countered by other studies that found lower emissions on small scale bread making facilities, contesting the accuracy of the measurements in the Schilich and Fleissner study. These studies show the inherent variation in farming production, which leads to varying levels of impact on the environment. Other environmental assessments of farming production methods include:
98_1	CAR_af469eb9dc99af4caeaa0cc0a264e1a9f75132ea	The term food security was first used in the 1960-1970s to refer to food supply and consistent access to food in international development work.  In 1966 the treaty titled the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was created to ensure economic, social and cultural rights including the “inalienable right to adequate nutritious food”.  In 1974 the World Food Conference focused on producing enough food for the world, ensuring the supply was reliable, and reducing dramatic price fluctuations.  Even early on it was clear that there was a great discrepancy between the world’s food supply and people’s access to food. Advances in agricultural technology in non-industrialized countries resulting in production of more food did not necessarily result in improved food access as evidenced by the  Green Revolution . Rather, many environmental problems such as insecticide resistant pests, soil erosion, and pesticide poisoning of both people and wildlife resulted. During the 1980s and 1990s food security became recognized as a major public health concern in industrialized countries.  The concept of food entitlement was introduced in 1981 along with a shift in focus to ensured food access with adequate supply at the individual or household level in industrialized nations.  Food security was measured directly by anthropometric means or by food intake assessment, and indirectly by indicators of poverty, comparison of wages to food costs, employment rates and the use of emergency food programs.  At the 1996  World Food Summit , the Rome Declaration on World Food Security reaffirmed, “the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”.  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most responses to food insecurity tended to occur at the community level.  Community level initiatives allowed for more long lasting solutions to food issues as they were designed to empower individuals and increase knowledge and skills as opposed to providing only a temporary solution to food access. These efforts contributed largely to the evolution of the concept of CFS in the 1990s when environmental concerns were gaining recognition.  The emerging concept of CFS captured the central idea that addressing food security at the community level would allow more interested parties to become involved in the decision-making and planning process as well as enable a larger range of issues to be addressed such as environmentally sustainable food production, fair wages for local producers, and more sustainable food assistance programs.

Mass meat production increase the amount of methane in the atmosphere.  For more information on the  environmental impact of meat production  and consumption, see the  ethics of eating meat . Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised,  free range  or  grass fed meat  is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.

Globally,  agriculture  is responsible for an average of 70% of  fresh water  consumption by humans; in some countries that figure jumps to 80%-90%.  Agriculture  is therefore also responsible for much of  fresh water  over-exploitation.  Food production  further impacts the water sector through  land degradation , changes in runoff, disruption of  groundwater discharge ,  water quality  and availability of water and land for other purposes such as natural habitat. The increased yields that have resulted from mechanization and other modern measures have come at a high energy price, as the full food and  supply chain  claims approximately 30% of total global  energy demand . Energy fuels  land preparation ,  fertilizer  production,  irrigation  and the sowing, harvesting and transportation of crops. The links between  food  and  energy  have become quite apparent in recent years as increases in the price of  oil  lead very quickly to increases in the price of  food . The energy sector can have other negative impacts on the food sector when  mining  for  fossil fuels  and  deforestation  for  biofuels  reduce land for  agriculture ,  ecosystems  and other uses.

In a perfectly efficient market, the costs of the fossil fuel would include the externalities associated with their consumption. Thus the full impact of their transportation costs would be reflected in the market price of the good. In the real world, there are no perfectly efficient markets. Much of the true costs of transporting goods around the world and consuming fossil fuel must be paid in the future dealing with the health and environmental effects of  pollution . It is also likely that economic disruptions will be caused by future shortages of fossil fuel energy and spikes in fuel prices since it is a finite resource that is being  depleted .

This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic  fertilizer s and  pesticide s to the resource costs of food packaging,  transport  (now a major part of global trade) and retail.  Food  is essential to life. But the list of environmental costs of  food production  is a long one: topsoil depletion,  erosion  and conversion to desert from constant tillage of annual crops; overgrazing;  salinization ;  sodification ;  waterlogging ; high levels of  fossil fuel  use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic  pesticides ; reductions in  genetic diversity  by the mass use of  monoculture s; water resource depletion;  pollution  of waterbodies by run-off and  groundwater contamination ; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of  rural communities .

Bee  pollination  is an essential ecosystem service essential for the production of many varieties of fruits and vegetables.  Subsidies often go towards subsidising meat production which has other nutritional and environmental implications; and it has been found that out of the $200Bn subsidies to subsidise crops from 1995–2010 around two thirds of this went to animal feed, tobacco and cotton production. On the other hand, farmers producing fruits and vegetables received no direct subsidies.  The  environmental impact of meat production  is high due to the resource and energy requirements that go into production of feed for livestock throughout their lifespan, for example, a kilogram of beef uses about 60 times as much water as an equivalent amount of potato. The subsidies contribute to meat consumption by allowing for an artificially low cost of meat products.

According to the report, based on figures from the United Nations'  Food and Agriculture Organization , the production of 1 kg (2.2 lb) of beef requires 15,455 litres of water (32,662 pints, or 110 bathtubs), cheese 5,000 litres, rice 3,400 litres and carrots 131 litres.  Over 75 kg (165 lb) of meat is consumed in the United States per person per year, 60 kg in Germany, 38 kg in China, and under 20 kg in Africa. 
98_2	CAR_56e06b314d3ada41213574b39d9840aa071aa1b9	Livestock  and meat production have one of the largest  water footprint s of the agricultural industry. Taking nearly 1,800 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef and 576 gallons for pork. For reference, it only takes about 108 gallons of water to harvest one pound of corn. Livestock production is also one of the most resource intensive agricultural outputs. This is largely due to their large  feed conversion ratio . Livestock's large water consumption may also be attributed to the amount of time it takes to raise an animal to slaughter. Again, in contrast to corn, which grows to maturity in about 100 days. This adds an extra 995 days of water to grow cattle. The global "food animal" population is just over 20 billion creatures, with 7+ billion humans, this equates to about 2.85 animals per human.
98_2	CAR_66f4a8d21cc1d1d12d4270272d83b648bd4385cd	According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.
98_2	CAR_8a1e4178d0cce6741cfbe9904e4f53bd6a88a42c	Considerable water use is associated with meat production, mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed.  There are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production, but the amount of water use assignable to such  production is seldom estimated.  For example, “green water” use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and “green water” has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production’s “water footprint”, and on rangeland, as much as 99.5% of the water use associated with beef production is “green water”.  However, it  would be misleading  simply to assign that associated rangeland green water use to beef production, partly because that evapotranspirational use occurs even in the absence of cattle. Even when cattle are present, most of that associated water use can be considered assignable to production of terrestrial environmental values, because it produces root and residue biomass important for erosion control, stabilization of soil structure, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, support of numerous primary consumers, many of  which support higher trophic levels, etc.  Withdrawn water (from surface and groundwater sources) is used for livestock watering, and in some cases is also used for irrigation of forage and feed crops.  Whereas all irrigation in the US (including loss in conveyance) is estimated to account for about 38% of US withdrawn freshwater use, irrigation water for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9%; other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector (for drinking, washdown of facilities, etc.) is estimated at about 0.7%.  Because of the preponderance of non-meat products from the livestock sector only some fraction of this water use is assignable to meat production.
98_2	CAR_9c45ad6c3db41be3a8e6f88222b1ca93b516d5ec	Virtual water use for livestock production includes water used in producing feed.  However, virtual water use data, such as those shown in the table, are often unrelated to environmental impacts of water use. For example, in a high-rainfall area, if similar soil infiltration capacity is maintained across different land uses, mm of  groundwater recharge  and hence sustainability of water use tends to be about the same for food crop production, meat-yielding livestock production, and saddle horse production, although virtual water use per kg of food produced may be several hundred L, several thousand L, and an infinite number of L, respectively. In contrast, in some low-rainfall areas, some livestock production is more sustainable than food crop production, from a water use standpoint, despite higher virtual water use per kg of food produced. This is because unirrigated land in many water-short areas may support grassland ecosystems in perpetuity, and thus may be able to support well-managed, extensive production of grazing cattle or sheep with a sustainable level of water use, even where large-scale production of more water-demanding food crops would be unsustainable in the long run due to inadequate surface water supplies and inadequate groundwater recharge to sustain a high level of withdrawn water use for irrigation. Such considerations are important on much rangeland in western North America and elsewhere that can support  cow-calf operation s, backgrounding of stocker cattle, and sheep flocks.  In the US, withdrawn surface water and groundwater use for crop irrigation exceeds that for livestock by about a ratio of 60:1.

In the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16.3% less greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents), 12.1% less withdrawn water use and 33.0% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.  From 1980 to 2012 in the US, while population increased by 38%, the small ruminant inventory decreased by 42%, the cattle-and-calves inventory decreased by 17%, and methane emissions from livestock decreased by 18%;  yet despite the reduction in cattle numbers, US beef production increased over that period.

That heavy use is dictated in large part by what people eat. People in India consume a lot of  rice . Rice farmers in India typically get less than half the yield per unit area while using ten times more water than their Chinese counterparts. Economic development can make things worse because as people's living standards rise, they tend to eat more meat, which requires lots of water to produce. Growing a tonne of grain requires 1,000 tonnes of water; producing a tonne of beef requires 15,000 tonnes. To make a single hamburger requires around 4,940 liters (1,300 gallons) of water A glass of orange juice needs 850 liters (225 gallons) of freshwater to produce.

According to the  United States Department of Agriculture  (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires nearly half of the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems.  In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat,  milk , and  egg  production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables,  legume s, seeds, and fruits.

At this time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. Affluence was not as high, individuals consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for water resources is much more intense. This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of meat and vegetables is rising. Competition for water from  industry ,  urbanisation  and  biofuel crops  is rising congruently. To avoid a  global water crisis , farmers will have to make strides to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.

For example, some grazing lands are unsuitable for food crop production, so that evapotranspirational water use would continue on land vacated by livestock, while additional water would be needed for crops to provide substituting food from lands elsewhere, and additional water would also be needed to produce substitutes for the non-food products of livestock.

The  environmental impact of meat production  is high due to the resource and energy requirements that go into production of feed for livestock throughout their lifespan, for example, a kilogram of beef uses about 60 times as much water as an equivalent amount of potato. The subsidies contribute to meat consumption by allowing for an artificially low cost of meat products.

The study also concluded that adopting a  vegetarian diet , even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet. They also concluded that "Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from  red meat  and  dairy products  to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food." In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles.

Several  Australia n newspapers wrote about the  neologism  "kangatarianism" in February 2010, describing eating a  vegetarian  diet with the addition of kangaroo meat as a choice with environmental benefits because indigenous wild kangaroos require no extra land or water for  farming  and produce little  methane  (a  greenhouse gas ), unlike cattle. Advocates of kangatarianism also choose it because Australian kangaroos live natural lives, eat organic food, and are killed humanely. For similar reasons, Australians have discussed eating only the meat of  Australian feral camel s ("cameltarianism").

It is recommended, for example, that a pregnant woman should aim to have something from the four main food groups everyday. These include fruit and vegetables,  carbohydrates , protein-rich foods and dairy foods. There are several vegetarian sources of protein: soy, cooked dried beans or peas, tofu, nuts or seeds, peanut butter, and eggs. Vegetarians focus on foods that are normally left out of most non-meat pregnancy diets such as include beans, fresh dark green vegetables, and whole grains which are good sources of protein. The risks associated with vegetarianism, that is to say the problems vegetarians face, can generally be lessened by a careful diet. These problems that many associate with vegetarianism, such as  anaemia , are in fact not due to the vegetarian diet alone, but more so to the fact that the subject in question has failed to supplement their body with the nutrition they require. When cutting out meats, some vegetarians fail to intake any other kinds of protein. To intake protein is very important during pregnancy as one of the cause of the anaemia is iron deficiency and it varies by region. The iron-deficiency anaemia increases the risk of low weight in birth and transmits the iron-deficiency to infants.

Nine of these amino acids are essential because your body can't make them. To get the most from protein: eat protein throughout the day: breakfast, lunch, dinner.
98_6	MARCO_3047273	Other protein sources lack one or more amino acids that the body can't make from scratch or create by modifying another amino acid. Called incomplete proteins, these usually come from fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Plant sources of protein (grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds) generally do not contain sufficient amounts of one or more of the essential amino acids. Thus protein synthesis can occur only to the extent that the limiting amino acids are available. (Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University)

Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next, while trans fats are to be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as  butter  or  lard ), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as  olive oil  or  flaxseed oil ). Trans fats are very rare in nature, but have properties useful in the  food processing  industry, such as rancid resistance.
99_5	CAR_3380b2e1868a892df5458b173b8acd5a065b16cd	Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as  butter  or  lard ), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as  olive oil  or  flaxseed oil ).

99_5	CAR_4b37fcaec4368aaca5d551e7b8f04b12cef5ec1a	Fats contain long  hydrocarbon  chains, which can either be unsaturated, i.e. have double bonds, or saturated, i.e. have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have  cis as opposed to trans  configurations. In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are  hydrogenated  to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40 °C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an  isomerization reaction  with the  catalyst  used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.Although trans fats are edible, consumption of trans fats has shown to increase the risk of  coronary heart disease  in part by raising levels of the lipoprotein  LDL  (often referred to as "bad cholesterol"), lowering levels of the lipoprotein  HDL  (often referred to as "good cholesterol"), increasing triglycerides in the bloodstream and promoting systemic inflammation. Trans fats also occur naturally in a limited number of cases.  Vaccenyl  and  conjugated linoleyl  (CLA) containing trans fats occur naturally in trace amounts in meat and dairy products from  ruminants . Most artificial trans fats are chemically different from natural trans fats. Two Canadian studies have shown that the natural trans fat  vaccenic acid , found in beef and dairy products, could actually be beneficial compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening, or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat, by lowering total and LDL and triglyceride levels. A study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that vaccenic acid raises both HDL and LDL cholesterol, whereas industrial trans fats only raise LDL without any beneficial effect on HDL. In light of recognized evidence and scientific agreement, nutritional authorities consider all trans fats as equally harmful for health and recommend that consumption of trans fats be reduced to trace amounts.
99_5	CAR_645afe3b3f9b87b9248063016e358a801fe2810c	Saturated fats  have hydrocarbon chains which can be most readily aligned. The hydrocarbon chains in trans fats align more readily than those in cis fats, but less well than those in saturated fats. This means that, in general, the melting points of fats increase from cis to trans unsaturated and then to saturated. See the section on  chemical structure of fats  for more information.
99_5	CAR_741947436ebac12137d6b641aa1240468031ee65	The major evidence for the effect of trans fat on CHD comes from the  Nurses' Health Study  — a  cohort study  that has been following 120,000 female nurses since its inception in 1976. In this study, Hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the study's  population  during 14 years of followup. He determined that a nurse's CHD risk roughly doubled ( relative risk  of 1.93,  CI : 1.43 to 2.61) for each 2% increase in trans fat calories consumed (instead of carbohydrate calories). By contrast, for each 5% increase in saturated fat calories (instead of carbohydrate calories) there was a 17% increase in risk ( relative risk  of 1.17,  CI : 0.97 to 1.41). "The replacement of saturated fat or trans unsaturated fat by cis (unhydrogenated) unsaturated fats was associated with larger reductions in risk than an isocaloric replacement by carbohydrates." Hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption. Replacing 2% of  food energy  from trans fat with non-trans  unsaturated fats  more than halves the risk of CHD (53%). By comparison, replacing a larger 5% of food energy from saturated fat with non-trans  unsaturated fats  reduces the risk of CHD by 43%.
99_5	CAR_e638c804825d989dec134ddab39d10d85ca5aa0f	Fears of high  cholesterol  were frequently voiced up until the mid-1990s. However, more recent research has shown that the distinction between high- and low-density  lipoprotein  ('good' and 'bad' cholesterol, respectively) must be addressed when speaking of the potential ill effects of cholesterol. Different types of dietary fat have different effects on blood levels of cholesterol. For example, polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease both types of cholesterol; monounsaturated fats tend to lower LDL and raise HDL; saturated fats tend to either raise HDL, or raise both HDL and LDL; and trans fat tend to raise LDL and lower HDL.
99_5	MARCO_1030085	Trans fat should be avoided. Most foods contain a mix of unsaturated and saturated fats.

99_5	MARCO_4814214	Trans fats might be monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, they are never saturated. A trans fat is a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer fatty acid(s). Therefore, trans fats have fewer hydrogen atoms than saturated fats. Trans fats are not essential for human life and they most certainly do not promote good health.
99_5	MARCO_5824131	Trans fats and saturated fats have been shown to raise âbad cholesterolâ more than dietary cholesterol. Aim to limit saturated fat intake to no more than 10% of your daily calories (approximately 22 g per day if you are consuming 2000 calories per day) and eliminate trans fats from your diet.
99_5	MARCO_7152375	Although some fats are healthy, you need to limit the saturated and trans fats you eat. Saturated fats, like those in meat, butter, cheese and other full-fat dairy products, and some oils, raise your total cholesterol. Trans fats, often used in margarines and store-bought cookies, crackers and cakes, are particularly bad for your cholesterol levels. Trans fats raise LDL cholesterol, and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the good cholesterol. Food labels report the content of trans fats, but, unfortunately, only in foods that contain at least one gram per serving.
99_5	MARCO_7416669	No, saturated fats and trans fats are different. Saturated fat increases low-density lipoprotein, which is bad for you. Trans fats do the same thing, but also lower high-density lipoprotein, which is good for you. Trans fats are a lot worse.

A diet high in  trans fatty acids , however, does appear to increase rates of cardiovascular disease. Worldwide, dietary guidelines recommend a reduction in  saturated fat . However, there are some  questions around the effect of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease  in the medical literature. Reviews from 2014 and 2015 did not find evidence of harm from saturated fats. A 2012  Cochrane review  found suggestive evidence of a small benefit from replacing dietary saturated fat by unsaturated fat. A 2013 meta analysis concludes that substitution with  omega 6 linoleic acid  (a type of unsaturated fat) may increase cardiovascular risk. Replacement of saturated fats with  carbohydrates  does not change or may increase risk. Benefits from replacement with  polyunsaturated fat  appears greatest; however, supplementation with  omega-3 fatty acid s (a type of polysaturated fat) does not appear to have an effect.

100_3	CAR_2381e0c8858bc9d647f191eba0025ce6dc8234e2	Porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns (PFMs) have a metal shell on which is fused a veneer of porcelain in a high heat oven.  The metal provides strong compression and tensile strength, and the porcelain gives the crown a white tooth-like appearance, suitable for front teeth restorations.  These crowns are often made with a partial veneer that covers only the aspects of the crown that are visible.  The remaining surfaces of the crown are bare metal.  A variety of metal alloys containing precious metals and base metals can be used.  The porcelain can be color matched to the adjacent teeth or gingivae.
100_3	CAR_98bce4299ef02da77f443d8ae58178006ca03044	Chairside CAD/CAM restoration differs from conventional dentistry in that the  prosthesis  is typically luted or bonded the same day. Conventional prosthesis, such as crowns, have  temporaries  placed from one to several weeks while a dental laboratory or in house dental lab produces the restoration. The patient returns later to have the temporaries removed and the laboratory-made crown cemented or bonded in place. An in-house CAD/CAM system enables the dentist to create a finished inlay in as little as an hour in some cases. Bonded veneer CAD/CAM restorations are more conservative in their preparation of the tooth. As bonding is more effective on tooth  enamel  than the underlying  dentin , care is taken not to remove the enamel layer. Though one-day service is a benefit that is typically claimed by dentists offering chairside CAD/CAM services, the dentist's time is commonly doubled and the fee is therefore doubled.

Such  dental restoration s, also referred to as indirect restorations, include  crowns ,  bridges  (fixed  dentures ),  inlays, onlays , and  veneers . Prosthodontists are specialist  dentists  who have undertaken training recognized by  academic institutions  in this field. Fixed prosthodontics can be used to restore single or multiple teeth, spanning areas where teeth have been lost. In general, the main advantages of fixed prosthodontics when compared to  direct restorations  is the superior strength when used in large restorations, and the ability to create an aesthetic looking tooth. As with any dental restoration, principles used to determine the appropriate restoration involves consideration of the materials to be used, extent of tooth destruction, orientation and location of tooth, and condition of neighboring teeth.
100_3	CAR_efccf2a964385c6d32fae5ac87fe1455608a6569	Cosmetic or functional intervention may be required if tooth surface loss is pathological or if there has been advanced loss of tooth structure. The first stage of treatment involves managing any associated conditions, such as fractured teeth or sharp cusps or incisal edges. These can be resolved by restoring and polishing sharp cusps. Then, desensitizing agents such as topical fluoride varnishes can be applied, and at home desensitising toothpastes recommended. Many restorative options have been proposed, such as direct composite restorations, bonded cast metal restorations, removable partial dentures, orthodontic treatment, crown lengthening procedures and protective splints. The decision to restore the dentition depends on the wants and needs of the patient, the severity of tooth surface loss and whether tooth surface loss is active. The use of adhesive materials to replace lost tooth structure can be performed as a conservative and cost-effective approach before a more permanent solution of crowns or veneers is considered.

Veneers can mask undesirable defects, such as teeth stained by tetracycline and damage due to an injury or as a result of a root-canal procedure.
100_3	MARCO_3273932	A primary difference between caps and veneers is the color matching options available with porcelain. Metal caps and gold crowns will always be noticeable and unattractive. With porcelain veneers, Dr. Quigless can whiten all of the teeth in your smile line, or match the color of one or two teeth if preferred.he difference between caps and veneers goes deeper than just appearance. Metal Caps. Traditionally, caps or dental crowns were used to replace large portions of tooth material, especially as a result of decay. If the decay is too great for a filling, a metal or gold crown was used.

Itâs a more conservative type of restoration when a patient doesnât have very [badly 01:11] damaged underlying tooth and theyâre really just trying to make some sort of a change in the way that the tooth looks.
100_3	MARCO_3566366	Porcelain Crowns vs. Porcelain Veneers. There are several fundamental differences between porcelain crowns and veneers: Porcelain veneers are considered the less invasive, more conservative option because they only require the removal of a small portion of the tooth to apply.

Crowns are often needed when a large cavity threatens the ongoing health of a tooth. They are typically bonded to the tooth using a  dental cement . Crowns can be made from many materials, which are usually fabricated using indirect methods. Crowns are often used to improve the strength or appearance of teeth.  While inarguably beneficial to dental health, the procedure and materials can be relatively expensive.
100_4	CAR_3795a0594beb4ddd228112fc94c28974eff1a824	From these theoretical risks, derive the real world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to  peri-implantitis  or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no  dental enamel  on an implant, it does not fail due to  cavities  like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 93–98 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to get caught in the gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there does not appear to be any additional  peri-implantitis  in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.In compound implants (two stage implants), between the actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue and can cause periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these implant interior spaces should be sealed.
100_4	CAR_51a4e5a19ec58b801a01fe47be2e35e1548e5ff8	An abutment is selected depending on the application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression of the top of the implant is made  with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a stock (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast metal piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.
100_4	CAR_7230f631fa11f8c86d717bd6acc7f8666341eed5	After placement, implants need to be cleaned (similar to natural teeth) with a Teflon instrument to remove any plaque. Because of the more precarious blood supply to the gingiva, care should be taken with dental floss. Implants will lose bone at a rate similar to natural teeth in the mouth (e.g. if someone suffers from periodontal disease, an implant can be affected by a similar disorder) but will otherwise last. The porcelain on crowns should be expected to discolour, fracture or require repair approximately every ten years, although there is significant variation in the service life of dental crowns based on the position in the mouth, the forces being applied from opposing teeth and the restoration material. Where implants are used to retain a complete denture, depending on the type of attachment, connections need to be changed or refreshed every one to two years.  A powered irrigator may also be useful for  cleaning around implants.
100_4	CAR_7bc27f9364a6c67a6cb8965b1e0cff6062dc7f3b	The early part of the 20th century saw a number of implants made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by  Per-Ingvar Brånemark ). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.
100_4	CAR_c645bcf135f845b00498cfffcc152f31253778a1	After being placed in a surgical procedure, dental implants undergo  osseointegration , during which time the surrounding bone grows into intimate contact with the surface of the implants and the implants become fused to the bone.  When this process has been deemed to have occurred to a sufficient extent, the implants are fitted with restorative abutments in order to allow dental restorations (e.g.  crown s,  denture s, etc.) to be cemented on, screwed down or otherwise attached.
100_4	CAR_e6b1532efa46f05d168bfce3825514216ef8afe7	In  dentistry , crown refers to the  anatomical  area of  teeth , usually covered by  enamel .  The crown is usually visible in the  mouth  after  developing  below the  gingiva  and then  erupting  into place. If part of the tooth gets chipped or broken, a dentist can apply an  artificial crown . Crowns are used most commonly to entirely cover a damaged tooth or cover an implant. Bridges are also used to cover a space if one or more teeth is missing. They are cemented to natural teeth or implants surrounding the space where the tooth once stood.There are various materials that can be used including a type of cement or stainless steel.  The cement crowns look like regular teeth while the stainless steel crowns are silver or gold.
100_4	CAR_f1e277137824154baf91eced9f4b5efccb4a5bfb	For individual tooth replacement, an implant abutment is first secured to the implant with an abutment screw. A  crown  (the dental prosthesis) is then connected to the abutment with  dental cement , a small screw, or fused with the abutment as one piece during fabrication.  Dental implants, in the same way, can also be used to retain a multiple tooth dental prosthesis either in the form of a  fixed bridge  or  removable dentures .

It takes the form of a titanium post that fixes into your jawbone and is topped by an artificial tooth. The crown of your dental implant will be almost indistinguishable from the rest of your teeth, and will work like a normal tooth - making implants a very attractive, long-term solution. The process can take between two and six months, as the crown is fitted once the titanium post has integrated with the jawbone.

Dental implants are widely considered the best solution for missing teeth or teeth that must be extracted and cannot be saved. Dental implants are made up of a screw-like implant, a crown, and an abutment which attaches the crown to the implant. The implant is fused into the jawbone, making it a permanent replacement almost indistinguishable from natural teeth. Dental implants are used in place of a conventional bridge or crown.
100_4	MARCO_1240285	Dental Implant Procedure. After an implant is surgically placed into the jawbone, an abutment is then attached to the titanium implant. It's to the abutment(s) that the custom-fitted crowns are attached. Dental implant procedures are increasingly two-step processes, but they can take three -- and often it's by choice.

Harold Prince ’s Cabaret was set in Berlin in the early 1930s, against the backdrop of the uprising of the  Nazi party , at a burlesque theater called the "Kit Kat Club". The name originated from the  Kit-Cat Club , an 18th-century English liberal political society.

After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band's name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band's concert repertoire grew to ten songs as a result of months of playing at local nightclubs and bars.  At a performance at a  strip club  in Hollywood called Kit Kat Club, the band members performed wearing only  socks  on their  penis es, an idea formed by Kiedis. This gained the band notoriety, and club owners even began booking the group on the condition that they would perform in this manner. The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with  EMI . Irons and Slovak however, decided to leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers in order to pursue a "more serious" future with rock band  What Is This?  Kiedis ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. Kiedis and Flea hired drummer  Cliff Martinez  from  The Weirdos  and guitarist  Jack Sherman  to fill Iron's and Slovak's places, respectively.  Andy Gill , formerly of  Gang of Four , agreed to produce their first album, 1984's  The Red Hot Chili Peppers . Gill and Sherman clashed with Kiedis and Flea; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album's production. Sherman was fired from the band following the tour and replaced by a returning Slovak.

102_1	CAR_32d9a50ef60053adea7600177844c7c5448d8dfa	In the  United States , Social Security is the commonly used term for the  federal  Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. The original  Social Security Act  was signed into law by  President Franklin Roosevelt  in 1935, and the current version of the Act, as amended, encompasses several  social welfare  and  social insurance  programs.
102_1	CAR_561f6a89cc9c4d925c66c3a139a073ed850c6626	After the 1934 Congressional elections, which gave Roosevelt large majorities in both houses, his administration drafted a fresh surge of New Deal legislation. The most important program of 1935, and perhaps the New Deal as a whole, was the  Social Security Act , drafted by  Frances Perkins . It established a permanent system of universal retirement pensions ( Social Security ),  unemployment insurance , and welfare benefits for the handicapped and needy children in families without a father present. The United States had been the only modern industrial country where people faced the Depression without any national system of social security, though a handful of states had old age insurance laws. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund; he said, "We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program." Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children and the handicapped.
102_1	CAR_75997a53aa45c088be63e42c7eee8bac64728770	The Foundation has provided information and analysis concerning Social Security since its earliest days. At the time of the inception of the Social Security program in the mid-1930s, the organization set up a “Committee on Old-Age Security” to look at the provisions of the  Townsend Plan , a movement in this country to provide some pension protection for the elderly in the aftermath of the  Great Depression . The Committee determined that the Townsend plan was unworkable, but its members continued to examine the issue of the elderly poor, and in 1937, More Security for Old Age, a report and program for action was published, providing an analysis of the newly created Social Security program. Through the ensuing years, the organization has returned to the issue frequently. More recently, beginning in the 1990s, the organization has supported numerous studies and reports, including Ensuring the Essentials by former Social Security Administrator Robert Ball (2000); Social Security Reform: Beyond the Basics, edited by  Richard Leone  and Greg Anrig, Jr. (1999); and Countdown to Reform: The Great Social Security Debate by  Henry J. Aaron , and Robert D. Reischauer (2001).

The traditional contributions are sickness-maternity-insurance-disability-death, old age, widowhood, and accidents at work.

When Congress sets up particular programs, the legislation may itself set up the necessary appropriation mechanism, such as the  social security  program where payment of benefits are "mandatory". A  mandatory program  does not need an additional authorisation in order for spending under the program to occur. An  authorization bill  can create programs and make known Congress's intended level of spending for programs that also require an appropriation. What distinguishes a mandatory program from a  discretionary program  is that after Congress enacts a law creating a mandatory program, the program is permitted to spend funds until the program expires based on a provision in law, or until a subsequent law either terminates the program or reauthorizes it. "Discretionary" programs typically require annual appropriations legislation.

The case was adjudicated and reviewed and sent to the  Treasury Department  for payment in January 1940. The claims were grouped in batches of 1,000 and a Certification List for each batch was sent to Treasury. Miss Fuller's claim was the first one on the first Certification List and so the first Social Security check, check number 00-000-001, was issued to Ida May Fuller in the amount of $22.54 and dated January 31, 1940.

The unfavorable combination of demographics and per-capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century. Multiple government sources have argued these programs are fiscally unsustainable as presently structured due to the extent of future borrowing and related interest required to fund them; here is a 2009 summary from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees:
102_4	CAR_42d0b0dfd756dd7ba4501b270f0d84771c616ed6	Since the government borrowed and spent the trust funds' assets, there is no "lockbox" or marketable investment portfolio of $2.4 trillion for Social Security or $380 billion for Medicare. The trust funds contain non-marketable "IOU's" that the government is legally obligated to pay. In the absence of significant budget surpluses, the government will be required to convert these non-marketable securities to marketable securities by borrowing in the future, as trust fund claims are redeemed.
102_4	CAR_5465dd443e83caa222dd9699fa59acabab181fc5	In his speech, Bush did not address the issue of how the system would continue to provide benefits for current and near-future retirees if some of the incoming Social Security tax receipts were to be diverted into private accounts. A few days later, however,  Vice-President   Dick Cheney  stated that the plan would require borrowing $758 billion over the period 2005 to 2014; that estimate has been criticized as being unrealistically low.
102_4	CAR_58ecff225dbad753cc736b8bfe00867c486e8acb	On February 2, 2005,  President   George W. Bush  made Social Security a prominent theme of his  State of the Union Address . One consequence was increased public attention to the nature of the Social Security Trust Fund. Unlike a typical private pension plan, the Social Security Trust Fund does not hold any marketable assets to secure workers' paid-in contributions. Instead, it holds non-negotiable United States  Treasury bond s and U.S. securities backed "by the  full faith and credit  of the U.S. government". The trust funds have been invested primarily in non-marketable Treasury debt, first, because the Social Security Act prohibits "prefunding" by investment in equities or corporate bonds and, second, because of a general desire to avoid large swings in the Treasuries market that would otherwise result if Social Security invested large sums of payroll tax receipts in marketable government bonds or redeemed these marketable government bonds to pay benefits.
102_4	CAR_5d3dd3bef1093801659f4a99f53812493e8f4681	Along with strong backing from traditional Democrats and liberals, Clinton was able to garner the support of moderates who appreciated his centrist " New Democrat " policies, which steered away from the expansion of government services of the New Deal and Great Society and allowed him to " triangulate ", taking away many of the Republicans' top issues. One example of such compromises was  welfare reform  legislation signed into law in 1996. The new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments, but did allow states to exempt 20% of their caseloads from the time limits. Clinton also pursued tough federal anti-crime measures, steering more federal dollars toward the  war on drugs , and calling for the hiring of 100,000 new police officers. Compromise came with difficulty, though, as the parties failed to agree on a budget, causing the  federal government to shut down  in late 1995 into early 1996. By the end of his administration, the federal government had experienced the country's longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus. The first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the  Social Security Trust Fund .
102_4	CAR_84edb8f5c9e6ea95e456890e2941d3c70af0fd81	The Trust Fund represents a legal obligation of the federal government to program beneficiaries. The government has borrowed nearly $2.8 trillion as of 2014 from the Trust Fund and used the money for other purposes. Under current law, when the program goes into an annual cash deficit, the government has to seek alternate funding beyond the payroll taxes dedicated to the program to cover the shortfall. This reduces the trust fund balance to the extent this occurs. The program deficits are expected to exhaust the fund by 2034. Thereafter, since Social Security is only authorized to pay beneficiaries what it collects in payroll taxes dedicated to the program, program payouts will fall by an estimated 21%.
102_4	CAR_994a1672ba9d98458e8598543469c88da71c5211	The accumulated surpluses are invested in special non-marketable  Treasury securities  (treasuries) issued by the U.S. government, which are deposited in the  Social Security Trust Fund . At the end of 2009, the Trust Fund stood at $2.5 trillion. The $2.5 trillion amount owed by the federal government to the Social Security Trust Fund is also a component of the  U.S. National Debt , which stood at $15.7 trillion as of May 2012. By 2019, the government is expected to have borrowed nearly $3.8 trillion against the Social Security Trust Fund.
102_4	CAR_e99e6e73be6f65f6b1243dfceaca6113bc6b9387	Social Security has collected approximately $2.8 trillion more in payroll taxes and interest than have been paid out since tax collection began in 1937. This surplus is referred to as the  Social Security Trust Fund . However, the government has borrowed and spent these amounts for other purposes. The fund contains non-marketable Treasury securities backed "by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government". The funds borrowed from the program are part of the total national debt of $18.9 trillion as of December 2015. Due to interest, the Trust Fund will continue increasing through the end of 2020, reaching a peak of approximately $2.9 trillion. Social Security has the legal authority to draw amounts from other government revenue sources besides the payroll tax, to fully fund the program, while the Trust Fund exists. However, payouts greater than payroll tax revenue and interest income over time will liquidate the Trust Fund by 2035, meaning that only the ongoing payroll tax collections thereafter will be available to fund the program. 
102_4	CAR_ee0363a69fb79c051a3dccdc06b44844181c9298	The Social Security Administration's authority to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e., redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends in part on the federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay Social Security is based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations.
102_4	CAR_f9c1a9a4d755f48b2e00b8f6a1d448e3e6f09142	However, the funds from loans made have been spent along with other revenues in the general funds in satisfying annual budgets. At some point, however, absent any change in the law, the Social Security Administration will finance payment of benefits through the net redemption of the assets in the Trust Fund. Because those assets consist solely of U.S. government securities, their redemption will represent a call on the federal government's general fund, which for decades has been borrowing the Trust Fund's surplus and applying it to its expenses to partially satisfy budget deficits. To finance such a projected call on the general fund, some combination of increasing taxes, cutting other government spending or programs, selling government assets, or borrowing would be required.
102_4	MARCO_1444384	The law was intended to give the Treasury greater discretion over borrowing by eliminating the need for Congress to approve each new issuance of debt. Over the years the limit has been raised repeatedly, to $14.3 trillion today from roughly $43 billion in 1940. Of the $14.3 trillion, $4.6 trillion is held by other government accounts, like Social Security trust funds.
102_4	MARCO_1555045	However, instead of cash, these two trust funds have IOUs from the US government. All of those assets are held in special non-marketable securities of the US Government. So, the US government borrows from the OASI, DI and many others to finance its deficit spending. As a matter of fact, as of this second, the US government currently has  intragovernmental holdings  of $4.776 trillion. Intragovernmental holdings is money that the government owes to programs such as OASI, DI and many others.
102_4	MARCO_1555048	None of the money was saved or invested in anything. Social Security is not broken, but at the moment, it is broke. The cost of paying full benefits in 2010 was $49 billion more than Social Security tax revenue for the year. So the government had to borrow $49 billion (probably from China) in order to pay full benefits. And the gap between the cost of benefits and Social Security tax revenue will get bigger and bigger in the years ahead.
102_4	MARCO_3273407	A1: There has never been any change in the way the Social Security program is financed or the way that Social Security payroll taxes are used by the federal government. The Social Security Trust Fund was created in 1939 as part of the Amendments enacted in that year.
102_4	MARCO_3466213	Today, the federal government automatically puts all of the money that should be set aside for the Social Security Trust Fund into the General Fund. Raiding the Social Security Trust Fund was a precedent set in 1968 by another progressive president, Lyndon B. Johnson, to help pay for the Vietnam War. To date, the federal government has borrowed over $2 trillion from the Social Security Trust Fund to spend on other programs.

102_4	MARCO_5295295	The Social Security Trust Fund was created in 1939 as part of the Amendments enacted in that year. From its inception, the Trust Fund has always worked the same way. The Social Security Trust Fund has never been put into the general fund of the government.. Most likely this question comes from a confusion between the financing of the Social Security program and the way the Social Security Trust Fund is treated in federal budget accounting.
102_4	MARCO_5772121	In the 1980s and 1990s, the federal government borrowed billions and billions of dollars annually to pay for expenditures that exceeded the billions and billions of dollars that it took in from tax revenues.

Of that $3.7 trillion, over $3.2 trillion was financed by federal revenues. The remaining amount ($438 billion) was financed by borrowing. As the chart below shows, three major areas of spending each make up about one-fifth of the budget: Social Security: Last year, 24 percent of the budget, or $888 billion, paid for Social Security, which provided monthly retirement benefits averaging $1,342 to 40 million retired workers in December 2015.
102_4	MARCO_7544987	To prevent Social Security from losing tax revenue during the reduced Social Security worker 2.0% tax rate reduction in 2011 and 2012, Congress borrowed money from the federal general tax fund and transferred it to the Social Security trust funds.
102_4	MARCO_8192400	But Social Security ran it last annual surplus in 2009, and began running permanent annual deficits in 2010. The cost of paying full Social Security benefits for 2010 exceeded Social Securityâs total tax revenue by $49 billion. So how did the government pay full Social Security benefits in 2010? They borrowed $49 billion from China, or one of our other creditors.
102_4	MARCO_8300161	So, when the CATO Institute says that âSocial Security is already. $13.6 trillion in debt,â they do not mean that we have borrowed $13.6 Trillion from Social Security. They mean that, over the infinite horizon, we face a shortfall of $13.6 Trillion in addition to the $2.4 Trillion âsittingâ in the Trust Fund.
102_4	MARCO_8463148	The government has borrowed roughly 2.8 trillion from the Social Security trust funds alone. Here are some facts to consider to help you sort through the ideology in the answer that you get. 1) The trust funds get better terms than most private pensions.
102_5	CAR_5f352871ee1a8ec1fa4010ffc49128f91394f1a9	The  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act  of 1996 had a “fundamental shift in both methods and goal of the federal cash assistance to the poor.”  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  (TANF),  Aid to Families with Dependent Children  (AFDC), the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) were among the organizations of this act. The spending was $22.6 billion, in 1995. This bill was followed with reduction of unemployment. The federal budget is the combination of both the U.S. taxes and spending. During Clinton’s presidency, these acts had brought the economy out of its deficit and into a surplus. However, the surplus was only recorded against public debt which was calculated with the exclusion of intragovernmental holdings. This meant that the administration was able to record loans made by the social security trust fund to the government as revenue on budget reports, which accounted for the bulk of the surplus money. Including the money owed to the social security trust fund, the lowest deficit was $17.9 billion, in the year 1999-2000, the lowest level since 1973-1974.The total national debt (gross federal debt) rose every year of the Clinton Administration from $4.3 trillion to $5.6 trillion and from $5.4 trillion to $5.6 trillion over these years.
102_5	CAR_646e2c22fbedf435c1362f9fdbea241bfabc0d6b	The Social Security Administration collects payroll taxes and uses the money collected to pay Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits by way of trust funds. When the program runs a surplus, the excess funds increase the value of the Trust Fund. At the end of 2014, the Trust Fund contained (or alternatively, was owed) $2.79 trillion, up $25 billion from 2013. The Trust Fund is required by law to be invested in non-marketable  securities  issued and guaranteed by the "full faith and credit" of the federal government.

Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009, the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S.  government bond s. Thus, the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose  deficit spending . In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion. The Trust Fund is regarded by some as an accounting construct which holds no economic significance. Others argue that it has specific legal significance because the Treasury securities it holds are backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government, which has an obligation to repay its debt.

102_5	MARCO_560685	What Is Sovereign Debt? Definition: Sovereign debt is how much a country's government owes. It means the same thing as national debt, country debt or government debt because the word sovereign also means national government. It often refers to how much the country owes to outside creditors, which is why it is often used interchangeably with public debt. Sovereign debt is an accumulation of a government's annual deficits. Therefore, it shows how much more a government spends than it receives in revenue over time. Governments usually finance their debt through bonds, such as U.S. Treasury notes. These bonds have terms from three months to 30 years.

In FY2008, Social Security received $180 billion more in payroll taxes and accrued interest than it paid out in benefits.  This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special non-marketable Treasury securities. The Social Security surplus reduces the amount of U.S. Treasury borrowing from the public, as the surplus funds may be used for other government purposes. The total balance of the trust funds was $2.4 trillion in 2008 and is estimated to reach $3.7 trillion by 2016. At that point, payments will exceed payroll tax revenues, resulting in the gradual reduction of the trust funds balance as the securities are redeemed against other types of government revenues.  By 2037, according to some estimates, the trust funds will be exhausted. Under current law, Social Security payouts would be reduced by 24% at that time, as only payroll taxes are authorized to cover benefits.

The plan called to give younger workers the option of redirecting some  payroll tax es into their own private account. Current retirees and those soon to retire would see little change, but opponents of Social Security reform contend that later retirees would receive lower benefits. Congress' budget analysts estimated that the program's trust funds would be depleted in 2052, and something had to be done to save the program. Republicans even argued that the trust fund had already been spent for other purposes with no plan to pay it back and that Social Security would run out of funds by 2018.  Democrats , however, accused the President and other Republicans of creating a Social Security scare, and that the program was not in as much danger as the Republicans had claimed. The Social Security plan remained a priority for Bush's national agenda for several months but it proved unpopular with the majority of the public and ultimately, since no reform bill was released by committees in the Republican controlled House and Senate, nothing came to pass.

For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves. In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits. The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by  Alan Greenspan , was created to address the crisis.

In the early 1980s, financial projections of the Social Security Administration indicated near-term revenue from payroll taxes would not be sufficient to fully fund near-term benefits (thus raising the possibility of benefit cuts).  The federal government appointed the  National Commission on Social Security Reform , headed by  Alan Greenspan  (who had not yet been named Chairman of the  Federal Reserve ), to investigate what additional changes to federal law were necessary to shore up the fiscal health of the Social Security program. The Greenspan Commission projected that the system would be solvent for the entirety of its 75-year forecast period with certain recommendations. The changes to federal law enacted in 1983 and signed by President Reagan  and pursuant to the recommendations of the Greenspan Commission advanced the time frame for previously scheduled payroll tax increases (though it raised slightly the payroll tax for the self-employed to equal the employer-employee rate), changed certain benefit calculations, and raised the retirement age to 67 by the year 2027.  As of the end of calendar year 2010, the accumulated surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund stood at just over $2.6 trillion.

As the " baby boomers " move out of the work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds to pay their bills. The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total "Social Security" expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars which were 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit). All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue. As the trust funds are exhausted either benefits will have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the  Center for Economic and Policy Research ,  upward redistribution of income  is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.

This work helped guide financing discussions throughout the Social Security “crisis debates” of the 1980s.Chen’s 1980 introductory Social Security text discussed the implications of changing family patterns for the benefit structure of Social Security. It pointed out that the largely static (and therefore outdated) Social Security benefit structure leaves the most financially vulnerable people—often women, minorities, and children—with increasingly less or no protection. He has continued to write and testify on this subject, urging legislative attention to the need to provide improved Social Security benefits not only to retired and disabled workers but also to their eligible dependents and survivors, including children.

The cash flow deficit in the Social Security system will have leveled off as a share of the economy. This projection has come into question. Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make solvency worse. Some economists believe future productivity growth will be higher than the current projections by the Social Security Trustees. In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.

Advocates of the current system say that the projected deficits in Social Security are identical to the "prescription drug benefit" enacted in 2002. They say that demographic and revenue projections might turn out to be too pessimistic—and that the current health of the economy exceeds the assumptions used by the Social Security Administration.

One consequence was increased public attention to the nature of the Social Security Trust Fund. Unlike a typical private pension plan, the Social Security Trust Fund does not hold any marketable assets to secure workers' paid-in contributions. Instead, it holds non-negotiable United States  Treasury bond s and U.S. securities backed "by the  full faith and credit  of the U.S. government". The trust funds have been invested primarily in non-marketable Treasury debt, first, because the Social Security Act prohibits "prefunding" by investment in equities or corporate bonds and, second, because of a general desire to avoid large swings in the Treasuries market that would otherwise result if Social Security invested large sums of payroll tax receipts in marketable government bonds or redeemed these marketable government bonds to pay benefits.
102_7	CAR_58fe77b71f568f04e47cc3268c112c56fc935254	For example, the  United States Social Security  system is a funded program. It is funded through a payroll tax ( FICA ) that is paid by employees and employers. The proceeds of this tax are paid into the Social Security Trust Funds which had a balance of $2,804,858 million as of July 2014. The funding status of US Social Security is reviewed annually by the Social Security Office of the Chief Actuary. A report on the status of US Social Security is issued annually by the Social Security Trustees, projecting funding needs out 75 years.
102_7	CAR_5ccb835c0ee4352171c9b583ecdedfef4aac015d	However, even right-leaning politicians have been inconsistent with the language they use when referencing Social Security.  For example, Bush has referred to the system going "broke" in 2042. That date arises from the anticipated depletion of the Trust Fund, so Bush's language "seem[s] to suggest that there's something there that goes away in 2042." Specifically, in 2042 and for many decades thereafter, the Social Security system can continue to pay benefits, but benefit payments will be constrained by the revenue base from the 12.4% FICA (Social Security payroll) tax on wages. According to the Social Security trustees, continuing payroll tax revenues at the rate of 12.4% will enable Social Security to pay about 74% of promised benefits during the 2040s, with this ratio falling to about 70% by the end of the forecast period in 2080.
102_7	CAR_781e72f85efbd0a47b2390140b67b8572afbad9d	The  U.S. federal social security system  functions through the taxation of large numbers of young workers, in order to support smaller numbers of older dependents. A diminishing workforce, coupled with growing numbers of longer-living elderly can deplete the social security system. The Social Security Administration estimates that the old age dependency ratio (people ages 65+ divided by people ages 20–64) in 2080 will be over 40%, compared to the 20% old age dependency ratio in 2005. Increasing life expectancies of the older population will not only result in decreases in Social Security Benefits, but also devalues private and public pension programs. The dearth of funds supplying programs such as social security and Medicare may be a contributing factor for adults to delay retirement and to continue working.
102_7	CAR_84edb8f5c9e6ea95e456890e2941d3c70af0fd81	The Trust Fund represents a legal obligation of the federal government to program beneficiaries. The government has borrowed nearly $2.8 trillion as of 2014 from the Trust Fund and used the money for other purposes. Under current law, when the program goes into an annual cash deficit, the government has to seek alternate funding beyond the payroll taxes dedicated to the program to cover the shortfall. This reduces the trust fund balance to the extent this occurs. The program deficits are expected to exhaust the fund by 2034. Thereafter, since Social Security is only authorized to pay beneficiaries what it collects in payroll taxes dedicated to the program, program payouts will fall by an estimated 21%.

Of particular concern was the issue of what would happen when people born during the  post–World War II baby boom  retired. The NCSSR made several recommendations for addressing the issue. Under the 1983 amendments to Social Security, a previously enacted increase in the payroll tax rate was accelerated, additional employees were added to the system, the full-benefit retirement age was slowly increased, and up to one-half of the value of the Social Security benefit was made potentially taxable income.

This surplus is referred to as the  Social Security Trust Fund . However, the government has borrowed and spent these amounts for other purposes. The fund contains non-marketable Treasury securities backed "by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government". The funds borrowed from the program are part of the total national debt of $18.9 trillion as of December 2015. Due to interest, the Trust Fund will continue increasing through the end of 2020, reaching a peak of approximately $2.9 trillion. Social Security has the legal authority to draw amounts from other government revenue sources besides the payroll tax, to fully fund the program, while the Trust Fund exists. However, payouts greater than payroll tax revenue and interest income over time will liquidate the Trust Fund by 2035, meaning that only the ongoing payroll tax collections thereafter will be available to fund the program.

These surpluses are given to the  U.S. Treasury  (and thus become part of the general federal budget) in exchange for special U.S. government securities, which are deposited into the trust funds. If the trust funds begin running deficits, meaning more in benefits are paid out than contributions paid in, the Social Security Administration is empowered to redeem the securities and use those funds to cover the deficit.

According to the projections of the Social Security Administration, the Trust Fund will continue to show net growth until 2022 because the interest generated by its bonds and the revenue from payroll taxes exceeds the amount needed to pay benefits.  After 2022, without increases in Social Security taxes or cuts in benefits, the Fund is projected to decrease each year until being fully exhausted in 2034. At this point, if legislative action is not taken, the benefits would be reduced.
102_7	MARCO_1281885	And in yearsof a Social Security deficit, the trust fund will beused as the additional source of revenue needed topay benefits to retirees. Under a fully funded system,all benefits paid out to recipients come directly fromthe revenue in the trust fund.
102_7	MARCO_1555048	None of the money was saved or invested in anything. Social Security is not broken, but at the moment, it is broke. The cost of paying full benefits in 2010 was $49 billion more than Social Security tax revenue for the year. So the government had to borrow $49 billion (probably from China) in order to pay full benefits. And the gap between the cost of benefits and Social Security tax revenue will get bigger and bigger in the years ahead.

Absent action from Congress, the Social Security Disability Insurance trust fund will run out of money in 2016. It might last into the beginning of 2017, if we're lucky.n 2012, SSDI would have had to cut payouts by 22.2% in order to balance its intake with its disbursements. If you look at the trust fund's projections, that's pretty close to the benefit cut that SSDI projects in 2016. Benefits will be cut around 20%. Beneficiaries will only be paid 80% of their current benefit.
102_7	MARCO_2413734	* Despite the interest payments that Social Security receives on the Trust Fund, the Trust Fund began declining in value in 2011, which is eight years earlier than the Social Security Administration projected in 2011, and 10 years earlier than what it projected in 2010.
102_7	MARCO_3222728	Eliminating the cap and raising what Social Security pays high earners wouldn't solve any Social Security shortfall. More money would come in, but more would go out. If we raise the cap but we don't pay high earners more, then Social Security begins to look more like a retirement planning welfare program.
102_7	MARCO_3466211	The interest income that the trust funds earn on their bonds, as well as the proceeds the trust funds will receive when their bonds are redeemed, will enable Social Security to keep paying full benefits until 2034. In 2034, the combined trust funds are projected to run out of Treasury bonds to cash in.
102_7	MARCO_3998246	After that, Social Security will begin redeeming its hoard of Treasuries for cash to continue paying benefits â as was the plan all along. Social Securityâs combined reserves likely will be fully depleted by 2034, according to the trusteesâ intermediate forecast.
102_7	MARCO_4027563	For now, the Social Security trust fund has enough money to cover the gap, starting this year and in 2011, when the cost of retirees' benefits will exceed the money coming into the program. The program then will return to small surpluses for two years, the report says. After that, deficits will grow rapidly, the report says, as the number of Americans in the large baby-boom generation who retire will grow faster than the number of workers paying into Social Security.
102_7	MARCO_4177020	The Social Security Administration's actuaries have projected that the disability insurance program's trust fund will run out of money next year, resulting in a 20 percent benefit reduction for nearly 11 million Americans.
102_7	MARCO_5897648	Best Answer: Social Security is NOT in debt. It is a trust fund. Money comes in via payroll taxes. Money in the fund earns interest. Money goes out to retirees and dependents. When people say the fund is in trouble, what they mean is we have reached a point of diminishing returns.
102_7	MARCO_5897652	For as long as the federal government is running deficits in excess of Social Securityâs cash-flow deficits, we can assume that this $840 billion shortfall will be matched dollar for dollar by an increase in the public debt. Social Securityâs cash-flow deficits add to the public debt because, in order to pay full Social Security benefits, the Treasury Department has to raise cash in excess of what it receives from the payroll tax and the taxation of benefits.
102_7	MARCO_6061813	The latest projections from Social Security's Board of Trustees show that the program's trust funds are set to run out in 2034, and when that happens, the program could face an $11 trillion shortfall. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Clearly this news isn't lost on concerned workers.
102_7	MARCO_7828166	When the reserve runs dry, the money washing in from current workers would be enough to pay 77 percent of benefits, according to the 2014 trustees' report. But realistically, in the mid-2030s, politicians are unlikely to slash the benefits received by retirees who have been counting on Social Security.
102_7	MARCO_7828169	The 2014 report from the trustees of the Social Security program estimated that the trust fund reserves will run out in 2034. That means Social Security won't be able to pay full retirement benefits starting in 2033.

WASHINGTON â Eleven million people face a deep, abrupt cut in disability insurance benefits in late 2016 if Congress fails to replenish Social Securityâs disability trust fund, which is running out of money, the Obama administration said Wednesday.
102_7	MARCO_8265101	The trustees of Social Security, including three cabinet secretaries, said the disability trust fund would be depleted in the last quarter of 2016. After that, they said, benefits would automatically be cut by 19 percent because revenues, largely from payroll taxes, would be sufficient to cover only 81 percent of scheduled benefit payments.

Orszag  proposed in their 2005 book Saving Social Security: A Balanced Approach that Social Security be stabilized by various tax and spend adjustments and gradually ending the process by which the general fund has been borrowing from payroll taxes. This requires increased revenues devoted to Social Security. Their plan, as with several other Social Security stabilization plans, relies on gradually increasing the retirement age, raising the ceiling on which people must pay FICA taxes, and slowly increasing the FICA tax rate to a peak of 15% total from the current 12.4%.

In it he said that immigration reform should focus on those who want to move to the U.S. legally. In a debate with other candidates, Knight called Social Security "a bad idea" and warned that the U.S. Social Security system retirement system will run out of money by 2030 if major changes are not implemented.
102_8	CAR_20cae7c27c465024311b371395b95ff23e6e55b4	Although Social Security is sometimes compared to private  pensions , the two systems are different in a number of respects. It has been argued that Social Security is an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot "prefund" by investing in marketable assets such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the  Federal National Mortgage Association  and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities. As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.

And that's a disgrace." The next day, he reiterated that Social Security uses current workers' tax payments to fund current retirees' benefits, and he said, "That’s why it’s broken, that’s why we can fix it."
102_8	CAR_4850d34b3dbba881320fd5005ed0525284085cef	The Social Security Administration projects that the demographic situation will stabilize. The cash flow deficit in the Social Security system will have leveled off as a share of the economy. This projection has come into question. Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make solvency worse. Some economists believe future productivity growth will be higher than the current projections by the Social Security Trustees. In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.
102_8	CAR_498e338f9af826154207d5fdd949eee00c0db2cd	However, the  National Active and Retired Federal Employees Associations  said that the chained CPI does not account for seniors citizens' health care costs.   Robert Reich , former  United States Secretary of Labor  under President   Clinton , noted that typical seniors spend between 20 and 40 percent of their income on health care, far more than most Americans. "Besides, Social Security isn't in serious trouble. The Social Security trust fund is flush for at least two decades. If we want to ensure it's there beyond that, there's an easy fix – just lift the ceiling on income subject to Social Security taxes, which is now $113,700."

102_8	CAR_54f226b9b29c2c30ec9c9feea4730ddc59387fa7	The first month of Bush's second term was largely spent in  debate  over one of his stated goals, partial  privatization  of  Social Security . The plan called to give younger workers the option of redirecting some  payroll tax es into their own private account. Current retirees and those soon to retire would see little change, but opponents of Social Security reform contend that later retirees would receive lower benefits. Congress' budget analysts estimated that the program's trust funds would be depleted in 2052, and something had to be done to save the program. Republicans even argued that the trust fund had already been spent for other purposes with no plan to pay it back and that Social Security would run out of funds by 2018.  Democrats , however, accused the President and other Republicans of creating a Social Security scare, and that the program was not in as much danger as the Republicans had claimed. The Social Security plan remained a priority for Bush's national agenda for several months but it proved unpopular with the majority of the public and ultimately, since no reform bill was released by committees in the Republican controlled House and Senate, nothing came to pass.
102_8	CAR_58ecff225dbad753cc736b8bfe00867c486e8acb	On February 2, 2005,  President   George W. Bush  made Social Security a prominent theme of his  State of the Union Address . One consequence was increased public attention to the nature of the Social Security Trust Fund. Unlike a typical private pension plan, the Social Security Trust Fund does not hold any marketable assets to secure workers' paid-in contributions. Instead, it holds non-negotiable United States  Treasury bond s and U.S. securities backed "by the  full faith and credit  of the U.S. government". The trust funds have been invested primarily in non-marketable Treasury debt, first, because the Social Security Act prohibits "prefunding" by investment in equities or corporate bonds and, second, because of a general desire to avoid large swings in the Treasuries market that would otherwise result if Social Security invested large sums of payroll tax receipts in marketable government bonds or redeemed these marketable government bonds to pay benefits.
102_8	CAR_62aac08794108f335caa08f8e4301d0d1dc5887d	These Social Security proponents argue that the correct plan is to fix  Medicare , which is the largest underfunded entitlement, repeal the 2001–2004 tax cuts, and balance the budget. They believe a growth trendline will emerge from these steps, and the government can alter the Social Security mix of taxes, benefits, benefit adjustments and retirement age to avoid future deficits. The age at which one begins to receive Social Security benefits has been raised several times since the program's inception.

He told  The Hartford Courant  in January 2005 when asked about Social Security, "if we can figure out a way to help people through private accounts or something else, great."  Although Lieberman praised  Lindsey Graham  (R- SC ) for trying to fashion a bipartisan social security plan, he ultimately voted against the Bush Social Security plan.
102_8	CAR_781e72f85efbd0a47b2390140b67b8572afbad9d	The  U.S. federal social security system  functions through the taxation of large numbers of young workers, in order to support smaller numbers of older dependents. A diminishing workforce, coupled with growing numbers of longer-living elderly can deplete the social security system. The Social Security Administration estimates that the old age dependency ratio (people ages 65+ divided by people ages 20–64) in 2080 will be over 40%, compared to the 20% old age dependency ratio in 2005. Increasing life expectancies of the older population will not only result in decreases in Social Security Benefits, but also devalues private and public pension programs. The dearth of funds supplying programs such as social security and Medicare may be a contributing factor for adults to delay retirement and to continue working.
102_8	CAR_84fdf6923cc910365f962ee8fbdad463c1fc851d	After the 1977 amendments, the economic assumptions surrounding Social Security projections continued to be overly optimistic as the program moved toward a crisis. For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves. In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits. The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by  Alan Greenspan , was created to address the crisis.

He supports raising the  retirement age , multi-pronged  means test ing for Social Security recipients, and changing the escalator built into Social Security from  the wage index  to the  inflation rate . He wants Congress to investigate privatizing part or all of Social Security with the goal being that the investment of contributions could be self-directed.

If the trust fund is exhausted, this means benefits must be paid from discretionary sources such as Income Tax revenue; it does not mean benefits will run out (although it implies other programs will need to be significantly curtailed given the size of entitlement programs relative to discretionary spending). In order to reduce the government's overall debt and interest expense, trust funds make inter-fund loans to the discretionary fund; otherwise, the government would simultaneously retain uninvested cash in reserves and borrow more at higher rates. Congress can, however, alter the standing law authorizing an entitlement program to increase solvency at any time by raising the tax rate on dedicated funding, decreasing eligibility, decreasing/restructuring benefits or imposing new taxes and fees. Courts tend to expand entitlement eligibility over time through broader definitions of eligibility, contributing to a tendency of scope creep and insolvency in entitlement programs. Trust funds also operate distinctly from discretionary funds in that they are allowed to accumulate surpluses over time. Discretionary funds are not allowed to accumulate  retained earnings  unless a specific  rainy day fund  is authorized. In discretionary spending, this is seen as a check on overtaxation.

In January 2000, he repeated his strong support for creating partially private Social Security accounts. In 2004, he said, "Without privatization, I don't see how you can possibly, over time, make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits."

This is a departure from Trump's earlier views; in his book published in 2000, Trump called Social Security a " Ponzi scheme " and said it should be privatized. Trump previously proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 from 67, but he backed away from this stance in 2015, instead claiming that Social Security should be funded by canceling foreign aid to anti-American countries.
102_8	CAR_ff9caf25c0a5731da1a74171c545cb94b15da3eb	Economist  Alice M. Rivlin  summarized major reform proposals in January 2009: "Fixing Social Security is a relatively easy technical problem. It will take some combination of several much-discussed marginal changes: raising the retirement age gradually in the future (and then indexing it to longevity), raising the cap on the payroll tax, fixing the cost of living adjustment, and modifying the indexing of initial benefits so they grow more slowly for more affluent people. In view of the collapse of market values, no one is likely to argue seriously for diverting existing revenues to private accounts, so the opportunity to craft a compromise is much greater than it was a few years ago. Fixing Social Security would be a confidence building achievement for bi-partisan cooperation and would enhance our reputation for fiscal prudence."

As the " baby boomers " move out of the work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds to pay their bills. The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total "Social Security" expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars which were 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit). All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue. As the trust funds are exhausted either benefits will have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the  Center for Economic and Policy Research ,  upward redistribution of income  is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.

On taxes, Dean favored repealing the  Bush Tax cuts  not only for the wealthiest of Americans as Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry proposed, but for all, including middle and lower classes. On Social Security, Dean took the approach of working to keep retirees their pensions, but offered little or no solution to keep  Social Security  alive in the coming years and decades.
102_9	CAR_22f895f4e5ec232212f61ad953e022e274c52a6a	The  CBO  projected in 2010 that an increase in payroll taxes ranging from 1.6%–2.1% of the payroll tax base, equivalent to 0.6%–0.8% of GDP, would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. In other words, raising the payroll tax rate to about 14.4% during 2009 (from the current 12.4%) or cutting benefits by 13.3% would address the program's budgetary concerns indefinitely; these amounts increase to around 16% and 24% if no changes are made until 2037. The value of unfunded obligations under Social Security during FY 2009 was approximately $5.4 trillion. In other words, this amount would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the shortfall over the next 75 years. Projections of Social Security's solvency are sensitive to assumptions about rates of economic growth and demographic changes.
102_9	CAR_5cbdd6ed100ff871e4e29543994199cd7950631d	In an open letter to the President, the Congress, and the American people, eighty economists, including  Nobel Laureate   Vernon L. Smith , stated that the FairTax would boost the United States economy. According to the  National Bureau of Economic Research  and  Americans For Fair Taxation , GDP would increase almost 10.5% in the year after the FairTax goes into effect. Real investments could increase by as much as 76% initially and remain 15% above present levels. In addition, the incentive to work would increase by as much as 20%, the economy’s  capital stock  would increase by 42%,  labor supply  by 4%, output by 12%, and  real wage  rate by 8%. A study in 2007 by the  Beacon Hill Institute  of Suffolk University stated that within five years real GDP would increase 10.7% over the current system, domestic investment by 86.3%, capital stock by 9.3%, employment by 9.9%, real wages by 10.2%, and consumption by 1.8%.  Laurence Kotlikoff  of  Boston University  finds that the shift to the FairTax would raise marginal labor productivity and real wages over the course of the century by 18.9% and long-run output by 10.6%. Further, studies of the FairTax at Boston University and  Rice University  suggests the FairTax will bring long-term  interest rate s down by as much as one third. As falling tax compliance costs lower production costs,  export s would increase by 26% initially and remain more than 13% above present levels. According to Professor  Dale Jorgenson  of  Harvard University ’s Economics Department, revenues to  Social Security  and  Medicare  would double as the size of the economy doubles within 15 years after passage of the FairTax.  Wall Street Journal  columnist  James Taranto  states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of  supply-side  effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money.

When the program runs a surplus, the excess funds increase the value of the Trust Fund. At the end of 2014, the Trust Fund contained (or alternatively, was owed) $2.79 trillion, up $25 billion from 2013. The Trust Fund is required by law to be invested in non-marketable  securities  issued and guaranteed by the "full faith and credit" of the federal government. These securities earn a market rate of interest.

For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves. In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits. The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by  Alan Greenspan , was created to address the crisis.

His website indicated that he "will work with members of Congress from both parties to strengthen Social Security and prevent privatization while protecting middle-class families from tax increases or benefit cuts. As part of a bipartisan plan that would be phased in over many years, he would ask families making over $250,000 to contribute a bit more to Social Security to keep it sound." He has opposed raising the retirement age, privatization, or cutting benefits.

Supporters of the bill state that "By making millionaires and billionaires pay the same rate of Social Security taxes as the rest of us, and by changing the method by which Social Security benefits are calculated, Sen. Harkin's bill would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $800 per recipient per year while also keeping the program solvent" for "generations". Supporters include the  Alliance for Retired Americans  The letter of support by the Alliance, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization of  4 million, states that S. 567 "recognizes the true importance of this great American program and proposes measures that would both enhance benefits for current beneficiaries and strengthen the long-term solvency of Social Security for all Americans".
102_9	CAR_acade4b8bfb4bbf8c2481bfed435653eca6d347e	In 2007, the Social Security Trustees suggested that either the payroll tax could increase to 16.41 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to 17.60 percent in 2081 or a cut in benefits by 25 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to an overall cut of 30 percent in 2081.
102_9	CAR_b71c5197b58071a47527e30ea969ab5861b6397e	In 1977, President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress increased the FICA tax to fund Social Security, phased in gradually into the 1980s. In the early 1980s, financial projections of the Social Security Administration indicated near-term revenue from payroll taxes would not be sufficient to fully fund near-term benefits (thus raising the possibility of benefit cuts).  The federal government appointed the  National Commission on Social Security Reform , headed by  Alan Greenspan  (who had not yet been named Chairman of the  Federal Reserve ), to investigate what additional changes to federal law were necessary to shore up the fiscal health of the Social Security program. The Greenspan Commission projected that the system would be solvent for the entirety of its 75-year forecast period with certain recommendations. The changes to federal law enacted in 1983 and signed by President Reagan  and pursuant to the recommendations of the Greenspan Commission advanced the time frame for previously scheduled payroll tax increases (though it raised slightly the payroll tax for the self-employed to equal the employer-employee rate), changed certain benefit calculations, and raised the retirement age to 67 by the year 2027.  As of the end of calendar year 2010, the accumulated surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund stood at just over $2.6 trillion.

It was thought that since the largest expenditure is retirement aid that social security expenditure was following the elderly.  However, this was not the case, as the data did not correlate between elderly population and increases in social security expenditure.  Further expenditures in social security are caused by the increase in disability insurance.  The Fisc argues that the later policy changes in the 1980s involving beneficiary eligibility may have a time lag, meaning the causes of those changes are just now being felt.  Medicare costs have continued to increase as well as the population ages and as health care costs increase.  Most of the increased expenditure has been seen in the south.  Grants have increased, but have been relatively stable over the fifteen-year period taken into consideration.  The largest increase has been in the form of  Medicaid  expenditures (Leonard and Walder,  Page 47-54).

The number of Social Security program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. The  present value  of unfunded obligations under Social Security as of August 2010 was approximately $5.4 trillion. In other words, this amount would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the shortfall over the next 75 years. The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.9% of the payroll tax base or 0.7% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.4% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP.
102_9	CAR_d8ff1b0b7eb94b0a739fcee70c540d98755d3eb8	The U.S. government is obligated under current law to make mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The  Government Accountability Office  (GAO) projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing. The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8 trillion. This is the amount that would have had to be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7 trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2 trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62 trillion. However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt.
102_9	CAR_d988731a12fefd12a7253b189b2234942b1f790e	The  CBO  projected in 2010 that an increase in payroll taxes ranging from 1.6–2.1% of the payroll tax base, equivalent to 0.6%-0.8% of GDP, would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. In other words, raising the payroll tax rate to about 14.4% during 2009 (from the current 12.4%) or cutting benefits by 13.3% would address the program's budgetary concerns indefinitely; these amounts increase to around 16% and 24% if no changes are made until 2037. Projections of Social Security's solvency are sensitive to assumptions about rates of economic growth and demographic changes.
102_9	CAR_e5b525f8679f8c1bed961f5b34e2271e3725cd85	Expert panels across the political spectrum have argued for a combination of revenue increases and expense reductions to reduce the budget deficit and future debt increases. However, the nature and balance of these measures varies considerably. Economist  Bruce Bartlett  wrote in 2009 that without benefit cuts in Medicare and Social Security, federal taxes would have to increase by 8.1% of GDP now and forever to cover estimated program shortfalls, while avoiding debt increases. The 30-year historical average federal tax receipts are 18.4% of GDP, so this would represent a substantial increase in tax receipts as a share of GDP relative to historical levels in the United States.  However, such an increase would still leave tax revenues relative to GDP substantially lower than other developed nations like France and Germany (see:  List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP ).
102_9	CAR_e99e6e73be6f65f6b1243dfceaca6113bc6b9387	Social Security has collected approximately $2.8 trillion more in payroll taxes and interest than have been paid out since tax collection began in 1937. This surplus is referred to as the  Social Security Trust Fund . However, the government has borrowed and spent these amounts for other purposes. The fund contains non-marketable Treasury securities backed "by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government". The funds borrowed from the program are part of the total national debt of $18.9 trillion as of December 2015. Due to interest, the Trust Fund will continue increasing through the end of 2020, reaching a peak of approximately $2.9 trillion. Social Security has the legal authority to draw amounts from other government revenue sources besides the payroll tax, to fully fund the program, while the Trust Fund exists. However, payouts greater than payroll tax revenue and interest income over time will liquidate the Trust Fund by 2035, meaning that only the ongoing payroll tax collections thereafter will be available to fund the program.

The band originally played  country music . In 1972, Dave Reed invited one of his music students, 15-year-old  Scott Murawski , to sit in with the band. Scott's early original association with the band ended abruptly when he was banned from a club that the band played at regularly for drinking a beer. A few months later Dave Reed came down with appendicitis, so Mark Mercier was brought in on keyboards and Scott was invited back to play guitar. Due to the influence of the  Grateful Dead , the band decided to incorporate more improvisation into the music becoming more electrified. The music of the  psychedelic era  had a heavy influence on the band, leading to a  sound and style more like that of the Grateful Dead and the rest of the San Francisco Bay scene. Eventually, Dave left the band to pursue country rock and acoustic ragtime music, leaving the band's line up as John, Bob, Scott and Mark.
103_1	CAR_2111b3a29bcf78c6fff182414e3c0acd6560d58d	The Grateful Dead was an American  rock  band formed in 1965 in  Palo Alto, California . Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of  country ,  folk ,  bluegrass ,  blues ,  reggae ,  rock , improvisational  jazz ,  psychedelia , and  space rock , for  live performances  of lengthy  instrumental jams , and for their devoted fan base, known as " Deadheads ". "Their music," writes  Lenny Kaye , "touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists." These various influences were distilled into a diverse and  psychedelic  whole that made the Grateful Dead "the pioneering Godfathers of the  jam band  world". The band was ranked 57th by  Rolling Stone  magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the  National Recording Registry  of the  Library of Congress . The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.
103_1	CAR_2f36f97be30d2baaa3ec9f7aa3e69d6a521f945c	The Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what " psychedelic music " was, but theirs was essentially a "street party" form of it. They developed their "psychedelic" playing as a result of meeting  Ken Kesey  in  Palo Alto, California , and subsequently becoming the house band for the  Acid Tests  he staged. The Dead were not inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melding several of them. It was doubtless with this in mind that  Bill Graham  said of the Grateful Dead, "They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do." Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.
103_1	CAR_396499ce399926d03171a8ff64e5c396b1732879	Their numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that they had first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical jams, which featured both individual improvisations as well as distinctive "group-mind" improvisations during which each of the band members improvised individually while simultaneously blending together as a cohesive musical unit. Musically, this may be illustrated in that the band not only improvised within the form of songs, but also with the form.  The Grateful Dead have often been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. The cohesive listening abilities of each band member made for a transcendence of what might be called "free form" and improvisation. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next (a  segue ).

Today the term even includes some groups completely outside of rock, such as those playing  world music ,  electronic music ,  progressive bluegrass , and  jazz fusion .

Two of the most influential bands from that era, the  Grateful Dead  and  Jefferson Airplane , started out in San Francisco in 1965. Other groups include rockers  Creedence Clearwater Revival ,  Santana , and  Journey , seminal  punk  band the  Dead Kennedys , and  alternative metal  band  Faith No More .

Since the 1980s, bands like  Phish ,  Widespread Panic ,  moe. ,  Umphrey's McGee ,  Max Creek , and  The String Cheese Incident  have used musical improvisation extensively; indeed, for the more devoted followers of any band, these extended improvisational segments—jams—are a large part of what makes a live show so special.  The jam band scene has also seen the rise of "jamgrass" with bands like  Hot Buttered Rum ,  Cornmeal  and  Yonder Mountain String Band , along with the rise of  Livetronica  with bands like  The Disco Biscuits ,  Lotus ,  The New Deal , and  STS9  (Sound Tribe Sector 9), most of whom feature improvisation in their music.
103_1	CAR_75ba9cfff533ae82a0f4febce87f73fa874561d1	In a contemporary review, George Kimball of  Rolling Stone  magazine said that "The Allman Brothers had many fine moments at the Fillmores, and this live double album (recorded March 12th and 13th of this year) must surely epitomize all of them." Kimball cited the band as "the best damn rock and roll band this country has produced in the past five years" and said of comparisons to the  Grateful Dead  at the time, "The range of their material and the more tenuous fact that they also use two drummers have led to what I suppose are inevitable comparisons to the Dead in its better days." In a less enthusiastic review for  The Village Voice ,  Robert Christgau  gave At Fillmore East a "B–" grade and said the songs "sure do boogie", but ultimately found it musically aimless: "even if Duane Allman plus Dickey Betts does equal  Jerry Garcia , the Dead know roads are for getting somewhere. That is, Garcia (not to bring in  John Coltrane ) always takes you someplace unexpected on a long solo. I guess the appeal here is the inevitability of it all."
103_1	CAR_7b8491230ffef9f38b31faa97e8302640b066510	The band that set the template for future Jam bands was the  Grateful Dead , founded in 1965 by legendary  San Francisco -based guitarist  Jerry Garcia . Although their studio albums enjoyed only modest success, and they were never an AM-radio favorite, "The Dead" attracted an enormous cult following, mainly on the strength of their live performances (and live albums). Drawing inspiration from  Eric Clapton 's short-lived (but influential) supergroup  Cream , the band specialized, in concert, in improvisational jamming. They played long two-set shows, and gave their fans a different experience every night, with varying setlists, evolving songs, creative segues and extended instrumentals. Their loyal fans ("Deadheads") followed them on tour from city to city, and a hippie subculture developed around the band, complete with psychedelic clothes, a black market in concert-related products, and drug paraphernalia. The band toured regularly for nearly three decades, except for a hiatus from 1974-1976. The eventual heirs to this "Shakedown Street" fan culture,  Phish , formed in 1983 at the University of Vermont in Burlington. They solidified their lineup in 1985, and began their career with a few Grateful Dead songs in their repertoire.

In addition to performing many of the songs regularly played in concert by the Dead, Furthur tried to "keep it fresh" by routinely adding new material to their setlists. This included many songs resurrected from the Grateful Dead's extensive songbook, including several rarely or never performed live, like "Alice D. Millionaire", as well as several cover songs from bands including  the Beatles ,  the Rolling Stones ,  Bob Dylan ,  the Band ,  Pink Floyd ,  Led Zeppelin ,  Ryan Adams ,  Van Morrison  and  the Clash .

However, the Grateful Dead allowed the "jam band" to become a genre unto itself; more recent bands following in their steps include  Phish ,  moe. ,  Umphreys Mcgee , and  Widespread Panic , all of which feature extended improvisational sessions. Other bands, such as the  Red Hot Chili Peppers  also regularly perform live jam sessions. Progressive rock band  Coheed and Cambria  often end shows with a jam session to their song "The Final Cut" with different instruments.
103_1	CAR_ae1ff14b031534830130b1fed4ff2736303ebcf7	Jackson takes this further, citing  drum mer  Mickey Hart  as saying "The Grateful Dead weren't in the music business, they were in the transportation business." Jackson relates this to the Deadhead phenomenon directly by saying "for many Deadheads, the band was a medium that facilitated experiencing other planes of consciousness and tapping into deep, spiritual wells that were usually the province of organized religion ... [they] got people high whether those people were on drugs or not." (For more on the spiritual aspect, see Spinners in the section below). It was times like these that the band and the audience would become one; The Grateful Dead and the Deadheads were all in the same state of mind.
103_1	CAR_d0032a6a88194e58912cc350824f2c521913681c	Jam bands are musical groups whose live albums and concerts relate to a unique fan culture that began in the 1960s with the  Grateful Dead , and continued with  The Allman Brothers Band , which had lengthy jams at concerts. The performances of these  bands  typically feature extended  musical improvisation  (" jams ") over rhythmic  groove s and  chord patterns , and long sets of music that can often cross genre boundaries. The Grateful Dead continued to grow their fanbase in the second half of the 1980s. In the mid-1980s the bands  Phish ,  Edie Brickell & New Bohemians ,  Blues Traveler ,  Ozric Tentacles ,  Widespread Panic ,  Bela Fleck and the Flecktones ,  Spin Doctors ,  Col Bruce Hampton  and  Aquarium Rescue Unit , began touring with Jam band-style concerts.

103_1	CAR_ded691c4ce8c57c3da97fefa4930484382efcd0e	In some cases, their improvisations have taken a backseat to more polished material, which may be due to their crossover commercial successes,  MTV  videos, and mainstream radio airplay. Most notable in pre-Jam band history was the obvious influence of the Grateful Dead. By the end of the decade, Phish had signed a recording contract with  Elektra Records , and transformed from a New England/Northeast-based band into a national touring band (see:  Colorado '88 ). While they may not have had Phish's commercial success, "With its fusion of southern rock, jazz, and blues, Widespread Panic has earned renown as one of America's best live bands.

A forerunner of these was  Reva L'Sheva , which was formed in 1994 by lead singer  Yehuda Katz  and bassist  Adam Wexler , formerly of  Diaspora Yeshiva Band , and which combined Carlebach's music and philosophy with the  jam band  stylings of  The Grateful Dead . In a similar vein were the groups  Moshav Band  and  Soulfarm , both formed by sons of DYB's Ben Zion Solomon who had grown up with Carlebach in the village of  Mevo Modi'im .
103_1	CAR_f04ed18921881df37f0928dd74b7ed21ba0360c6	The Phil & Friends concept takes the music of the Grateful Dead (and an ever-increasing number of other influences, including  Bob Dylan ,  Traffic ,  The Beatles ,  Led Zeppelin ,  Warren Haynes ' band  Gov't Mule , the  Allman Brothers , etc.) and explores and interprets it in new ways. Through the period known as the Quintet years (see below), a Phil & Friends show was often focused on harder, faster rock than that which the Grateful Dead played, thanks in large part to Haynes' and  Jimmy Herring 's talents at the  Southern rock  style. Lesh was fond of calling it " Dixieland -style rock." However, all of the incarnations of Phil & Friends have followed a trend of "updating" the Grateful Dead's massive body of work, and all have been extremely adept at the long, exploratory jams that were a trademark of the Dead. Phil & Friends has been acclaimed for giving new life to the Grateful Dead's material, bringing in new styles and innovations, while at the same time remaining loyal to the original music and the original fans. It is this melding of musical influences that has given them extremely wide appeal not only among old Deadheads, but the modern-day fans of other jam bands as well.
103_2	CAR_026938def588aa9e97ab2f18186d2eceeeaf9751	While each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation's sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist  Guy Picciotto  explained to the  New York Times  "“We liked this idea of, ‘Let’s just let it be everything,’ “ Mr. Picciotto said. “There doesn’t have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It’s all there, and it’s not cleaned up. You get what you get.” The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to  cassettes , then eventually digital formats such as  DAT ,  CD-R  and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes fliers, photograph's and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the  Grateful Dead  and  Phish , the only two other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.
103_2	CAR_0f266a4419b32e90a497b53df70993e952d7b973	Starting in 1984, the band recognized the fact that people were already "unofficially" taping their shows, so they started to sell  taper  tickets for a taper's section which allowed the tapers to bring their own microphones and tape decks to record with, as well as wrangle the tapers into one area of the venue so to keep them from interfering with other concertgoers.  This type of encouragement has spread to nearly all of the jam bands. Some jam band enthusiasts argue that if a band does not allow fans to tape their live shows, this band is not actually a jam band in the Grateful Dead tradition.
103_2	CAR_1670f965f48a2e276331f7f0da93194e0246d992	A taper is a person who records musical events, often from standing microphones in the audience, for the benefit of the musical group's fanbase. Such taping was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by fans of the  Grateful Dead . Audio recording, while not officially allowed until the creation by the band of a "tapers' section" behind the soundboard in the mid-80's, was generally tolerated at shows and fans would share their tapes through trade. Taping and trading became a Grateful Dead sub-culture.
103_2	CAR_1dd7fcc4c8c34ed4e89cf85d1928115e5b3768d7	Like several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the  tapers  set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the official sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the  sound board , which required a special "tapers" ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes. Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to connect directly to the sound board, which created exceptional concert recordings.
103_2	CAR_279de62518ad1b76dcbe9de8a896793cb8110bd0	Throughout their career, the  Grateful Dead  were known to tolerate taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, and the concept of taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers. The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including  Pearl Jam ,  Phish  and the  Dave Matthews Band  tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.

103_2	CAR_395c23113eed79152d2392ee6e2d62ab17ee97c0	By the late 1970s, some Deadheads began to sell tie-dye T-shirts, veggie burritos, or other items at Grateful Dead concerts.  This allowed many Deadheads a way to follow the band on its tours. During the early 1980s, the number of Deadheads taping shows increased, and the band created a special section for fans who wished to record the show. These tapes are still shared and circulated today via websites such as the  Live Music Archive  and  bt.etree.org . In the earlier days of the Grateful Dead, there were questions as to whether or not it was in the best interest of the band for fans to tape concerts.  As legend has it, when someone asked what Garcia thought about it, he replied, "When we are done with it [the concerts], they can have it."  The practice of  taping  has evolved with the digital age, and the rise of the Internet has made it extremely easy to share concerts through unofficial channels.
103_2	CAR_3e3ba84685ec947802ace61c30703802ed6a4d1d	Latvala was known for lending friends tapes from the official Grateful Dead vault. Nicholas Meriwether noted how many of tapes in the  Grateful Dead Archive  are labeled "'Courtesy of Dick Latvala. Do not circulate!'" In  Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America , Jesse Jarnow highlights the ambiguous stance Latvala took about these tapes being re-circulated. While refusing to speak to one friend for two years after learning that he re-circulated tapes, Latvala also "loves the Grateful Dead too much and wants the word of their music to travel into every ear and mind possible." Jarnow even claims that Latvala gave taper and future  Dark Star Orchestra  guitarist Rob Eaton a "near-complete copy of the vault."
103_2	CAR_40ed0a06883b7317b8a247fb412859d2983321bd	Jam bands often allow their fans to make tapes or recordings of their live shows, a practice which many other musical genres call "illegal bootlegging". The Grateful Dead encouraged this practice, which helped to create a thriving scene around the collecting and trading of recordings of Grateful Dead live performances. Most of the live shows on the Grateful Dead's 30 years of touring were recorded. It was probably the trading of recordings of Grateful Dead shows which built the band's fan base.
103_2	CAR_4ab95d1208c05c17150e061da8fb3d9891915414	Fans were also known to record the many  FM radio   broadcast  shows. Garcia looked kindly on tapers (he himself had been on several cross-country treks to record  bluegrass music  prior to the Grateful Dead), stating: "There's something to be said for being able to record an experience you've liked, or being  to obtain a recording of it ... my responsibility to the notes is over after I've played them." In this respect, the Dead are considered by many to be the first "taper-friendly" band.
103_2	CAR_55d9ce5da0ec0847b184fd1c425685fb5a2531f1	In Hilo, Dick Latvala worked as a zookeeper. Hawaii is where Latvala began to collect recordings of Grateful Dead concerts, often mailing other tapers pot in exchange for tapes. Latvala would exchange long letters with tapers on the mainland and extend an invitation to visit Hawaii, to smoke pot and listen to the Grateful Dead at high volumes. Dick and Carol moved back to California in the early 1980s, and although divorced they remained friends and even next-door neighbors, both working for the Grateful Dead at their Front Street office in San Rafael. While Carol worked in the Dead's ticket office, Dick initially performed menial tasks as well as managing the band's music archives. 
103_2	CAR_6632995d673e078068333b5e660f884c90a28191	Les Kippel was the founder of the First Free Underground Grateful Dead Tape Exchange in 1971  that recorded  and traded live Grateful Dead concert tapes for free. As the popularity of trading live concerts on tape increased, a practice the Grateful Dead allowed and ultimately encouraged, Kippel realized that he needed to get a more streamlined method of getting tapers together to trade.  He started a newsletter to help his fellow tape-traders connect rather than all of them having to go through him.  He and friend Jim McGurn came up with the name Dead Relix because each Dead tape, for them, was a relic. Jerry Moore became the editor-in-chief of Dead Relix, a relatively small magazine dedicated to taping and tape collecting the Grateful and bands of a similar ilk. The first issue was released in September 1974 with an initial print run of 200.  Kippel allowed a friend, who taught printing in a high school printing shop  to 'use' Dead Relix to teach printing to the students.
103_2	CAR_7b8491230ffef9f38b31faa97e8302640b066510	The band that set the template for future Jam bands was the  Grateful Dead , founded in 1965 by legendary  San Francisco -based guitarist  Jerry Garcia . Although their studio albums enjoyed only modest success, and they were never an AM-radio favorite, "The Dead" attracted an enormous cult following, mainly on the strength of their live performances (and live albums). Drawing inspiration from  Eric Clapton 's short-lived (but influential) supergroup  Cream , the band specialized, in concert, in improvisational jamming. They played long two-set shows, and gave their fans a different experience every night, with varying setlists, evolving songs, creative segues and extended instrumentals. Their loyal fans ("Deadheads") followed them on tour from city to city, and a hippie subculture developed around the band, complete with psychedelic clothes, a black market in concert-related products, and drug paraphernalia. The band toured regularly for nearly three decades, except for a hiatus from 1974-1976. The eventual heirs to this "Shakedown Street" fan culture,  Phish , formed in 1983 at the University of Vermont in Burlington. They solidified their lineup in 1985, and began their career with a few Grateful Dead songs in their repertoire.

He succeeded Alembic and  Owsley "Bear" Stanley  as the group's chief sound man after the Wall Of Sound in 1974 and subsequent band hiatus through 1975.  A favorite amongst  Deadhead s for many years, he helped to introduce a tapers section at Grateful Dead concert to allow audience recording of live concerts. Healy would sometimes provide direct output from the soundboard for the tapers to directly patch into their recorders.
103_2	CAR_874d77256cbbc13304eddd8eac261f28087e56a2	While attending Hampshire College, Dwork started the Hampshire College Grateful Dead Historical Society, where he began publishing the Grateful Dead research newsletter DeadBeat. Upon graduating from Hampshire College, Dwork began co-publishing the in-concert Grateful Dead newsletter Terrapin Flyer.  Dwork then co-founded the international music culture magazine Dupree's Diamond News, and for ten years served as its editor and publisher.  Dwork is co-author and editor of The  Deadhead 's Taping Compendium, an award-winning, three-volume encyclopedia of the  Grateful Dead 's music on  tape .  In 2013, the Grateful Dead included an essay penned by Dwork in the book accompanying the box set release of  Sunshine Daydream , the Grateful Dead's all-time most requested live concert recording.
103_2	CAR_8ae51203edc0a17eabbe820744ece2345be23d70	Due to the relentless touring of the Grateful Dead, and the fact that fans were allowed to tape the band's shows, many live versions of "Dark Star" exist. The studio recording of "Dark Star" lasted only 2:40, yet the song was known for its lengthy live performances, many of which clocked in at 20–30 minutes. Running over 23 minutes (13 minutes of it consisting of Jerry Garcia's guitar solo), the popular rendition as found on the  Live/Dead  live album was a blend of  psychedelia ,  jazz , and  jam  elements. "Dark Star" defines the Dead's early improvisational music.

There are over 200,000 free digital recordings in the collection. The subcollections include audio books and poetry,  podcast s, non-English audio and many others. The Live Music Archive sub-collection includes over 100,000 concert recordings from independent  artists , as well as more established artists and musical ensembles with permissive rules about recording their concerts such as the  Grateful Dead , and more recently,  The Smashing Pumpkins . Also,  Jordan Zevon  has allowed Internet Archive to host a definitive collection of his father  Warren Zevon  concert recordings. The catalog ranges from 1976–2001 and contains 1,137 free songs.
103_2	CAR_9a311e0264758dabb08962ad184786860439b6fd	While living in  Hawaii , Latvala became very active in  tape trading . He maintained numerous correspondences with Grateful Dead  tapers  and collectors, often trading marijuana for recordings through the mail. In addition to amassing a large collection of live recordings, in the 1970s Latvala began maintaining personal notebooks filled with commentary about particular Grateful Dead shows. As described by Grateful Dead archivist Nicholas Meriwether, Latvala "catalog[ed] his tapes in a series of notebooks, detailing their origin and provenance—who taped it and with what equipment—as well as when, where, what they played. He usually noted especially strong renditions as well as his impressions, which he would often revisit later, critiquing his critiques."
103_2	CAR_9f29c7a216ba68df0c4ac46ffe562f7ec703d0ba	It is a matter of strict custom among Deadheads that these recordings are freely shared and circulated, with no money ever changing hands. Some  bootleg recording s from unscrupulous bootleggers have turned up on the  black market , but a general "code of honor specifically prohibited the buying and selling of Dead tapes." These recordings, sometimes called "liberated bootlegs," are still frowned upon by the community and that feeling "has spread into non-Grateful Dead taping circles."
103_2	CAR_a1d63e37cf3d60ec769b96d53ec965b1ae9e8f33	At almost every Grateful Dead show, it was common to see fans openly recording the music for later enjoyment. This can be traced to shows in the late 1960s, with the number of tapers increasing yearly.  In 1971, Les Kippel, from Brooklyn, NY, started the First Free Underground Grateful Dead Tape Exchange.  The purpose of "The First Free Underground Grateful Dead Tape Exchange" was to preserve the heritage of the Grateful Dead's concert history by exchanging copies of recorded tapes made from audience members.  This started a new era in recording, collecting, and trading Grateful Dead tapes.  Often referred to as the "Original Napster", the tape exchange grew into an international movement that continues today.
103_2	CAR_a448365aca3c6b4e13c3eacd17bb20dabdd1247a	The Grateful Dead's albums had frustrated critics and fans alike for neither approaching nor accurately representing the band's live concert sound and experience - to the point that band-approved,  fan-made tapes  were preferred to official releases. The band's organization had poured profits into sound reinforcement and cutting-edge technology for their concert performances and were likewise frustrated by the seeming shortfall in capturing their sound on album.
103_2	CAR_acdadd5415d9d2608737399b170e4431b30aad98	This album is the first officially released Grateful Dead matrix recording. Matrix recordings digitally synchronize an amateur audience recording with the  soundboard  audio in order to add the natural, reverberative sound of the performance hall and the excitement of the audience. This can increase the "live feel" of what might be a "dry", or sometimes relatively lifeless recording. Various ratios of the two can be blended to reduce sound errors from microphone bleeding or errant mixing levels while adding the ambient sounds of the venue and lessening the possibly amateurish sound quality captured by microphones in the audience.  
103_2	CAR_ad721674559dd00cb5d2a9d86486958b445c1aa6	Phil & Friends has continued the Grateful Dead's tradition of allowing fans to record concerts, and trade these recordings freely. The Internet has been an invaluable source for these tapers to disseminate this music through various sources, including Archive.org, and the vast BitTorrent file-sharing network. Phil has also embraced the Internet by providing free  soundboard recording s of many concerts through his website, even providing high-resolution CD covers for fans to print. For his Summer 2006 tour, Phil partnered with Instant Live, a company that was able to provide soundboard CDs of a concert immediately upon its finishing, as well as make these recordings available for fans to download online, though this service was not free.
103_2	CAR_ae45973a94328d6571b92297aae15878b6e2f860	During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his "sonic journal" was to improve his ability to  mix  the sound, but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s.
103_2	CAR_bb8980badb8f3b7234dd6dfbb782320e2d7d5cfd	One from the Vault is a  live album  by the  Grateful Dead , recorded on August 13, 1975 at the  Great American Music Hall  in  San Francisco, California , and released April 15, 1991 on  Grateful Dead Records , the personal  record label  of the band. The concert was broadcast on FM radio, widely traded by fans on cassettes, and sold in  bootleg  LP versions under the titles Urubouros Deedni Mublasaron and Make Believe Ballroom. But it was not until the Grateful Dead released it on their  eponym ous record label, Grateful Dead Records, that high quality versions of the songs appeared. It was the first complete concert recording released commercially by the band. The concert also marked the first time that the then recently released album  Blues for Allah  was performed live in its entirety, albeit with a few other songs thrown in.
103_2	CAR_c658e3db2ce076489b3187ad7fe974d8d8f4afbc	Of the approximately 2,350 shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,200 were taped, and most of these are available online.  The Band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and  Dick Latvala  was their keeper.  Dick's Pick  is named after Latvala. After his death in 1999,  David Lemieux  gradually took the post.  Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened online by  Last.fm  members. In their book Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History,  David Meerman Scott  and  Brian Halligan  identify the taper section as a crucial contributor to increasing the Grateful Dead's fan base.

103_2	CAR_ff3ade835c622a563ae453bb29ea8d80c1f1e8c4	A unique feature of the jam band scene is fan taping or digital recording of live concerts. While many other styles of music term fan taping as "illegal bootlegging", jam bands often allow their fans to make tapes or recordings of their live shows. Fans trade recordings and collect recordings of different live shows because improvisational jam bands play their songs differently at each performance. By the 2000s, as internet downloading of MP3 music files became common, downloading of jam band songs became an extension of the cassette taping trend. Archived jam band downloads are available at various websites, the most prominent ones being  etree  and the  Live Music Archive , which is part of the  Internet Archive . More bands have been distributing their latest shows online.  Bands such as  Phish ,  Widespread Panic ,  The String Cheese Incident ,  Gov't Mule ,  ekoostik hookah ,  Umphrey's McGee ,  Lotus , and  The Disco Biscuits  have been offering digital downloads within days, or sometimes hours, of concerts.
103_3	CAR_03e5578f97fc933610e322d3141720e1c047dffd	"El Paso" was frequently covered by the  Grateful Dead  in concert. The song entered the band's repertoire in 1969, and remained there until the band's demise in 1995; in total, it was performed 389 times. It was sung by rhythm guitarist  Bob Weir , with  Jerry Garcia  contributing harmony vocals. On the album Ladies and Gentlemen... The Grateful Dead, Bob Weir introduces the song as the Dead's "most requested number". It was also recorded by The Mills Brothers.
103_3	CAR_0687c0f042a467973cd0607a9036a2ea0249717f	The "Touch of Grey" video received significant amounts of airplay on  MTV  and other music video stations.  Partly as a result of this, the song went on to become the Grateful Dead's only top ten hit.  Within a short time, the band had achieved a greater degree of popular, commercial success than in their previous 22 years in the music industry.
103_3	CAR_1477d455441913b8b79ba4b99621550d110000a0	It has since become one of the best-known Grateful Dead numbers and a standard part of their repertoire. According to Deadbase X, it would end up as the fourth-most played in concert Dead song in their long career with 581 performances (not counting isolated reprises), trailing only " Me & My Uncle ", " Sugar Magnolia ", and "The Other One".
103_3	CAR_17349a7af2c95dc95b9417743f86aef34336e88f	Vintage Dead was produced without the approval or cooperation of the Grateful Dead. However, it is a legal recording, not a bootleg. An upstart label called "Together Records" assembled live recordings of various  Bay Area  bands for a planned anthology. When the imprint collapsed,  MGM  paid the remaining debt and assumed the tapes, releasing two albums of Grateful Dead material on their  Sunflower Records  subsidiary. The first, Vintage Dead, reached number 127 on the  Billboard 200 . Produced as a  vinyl LP  and long out of print, it has not been released as a  Compact Disc .
103_3	CAR_1d0c1339015e004bf37c950b994aca076e637ccc	It was later heard by the Grateful Dead, who adopted it as part of their standard repertoire.  Bob Weir  is reported to have learned it from Curly Jim Cook, a member of the  Bay Area   A.B. Skhy  blues band. According to Deadbase, the Grateful Dead first played the song in late 1966. The earliest commercially released performance of it is from the Electric Theater in Chicago, on April 26, 1969, and is available on  Dick's Picks Volume 26 . The song continued to be performed regularly until  Jerry Garcia 's death and the end of the band in 1995.  According to Deadbase, it was the most-played song of all in the Dead's long concert career, with 616 performances. Since the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, the song continues to be a staple of the surviving members' performances.

It played sold-out stadiums. The media became more involved with the Grateful Dead scene as did the police and the government's Drug Enforcement Administration. Deadheads were targeted for drug use and gained something of a negative reputation. Relix recognized the profiling and tried to educate Deadheads about how to avoid the police and what to bring (and not bring) with you to shows.

Bands originating from the early to mid-1960s such as  The Beach Boys  and  The Kinks  had hits with " Kokomo ", " Come Dancing " and "Do It Again". Bands with popularity in the mid-1970s such as the  Steve Miller Band  and  Steely Dan  also had hits with " Abracadabra " and " Hey Nineteen ". Singer and songwriter  Bruce Springsteen  released his blockbuster album  Born In The USA , which produced a record-tying 7 hit singles.  Stevie Ray Vaughan  and  George Thorogood  sparked a revival of  Atomic blues  and  Blues rock . Massively successful hard rock band  Led Zeppelin  disbanded after drummer  John Bonham 's 1980 death, while contemporaries  AC/DC  continued to have success after the death of former frontman  Bon Scott .  Country rock  saw a decline after  Lynyrd Skynyrd 's 1977 plane crash and the 1980 disbanding of the genre's most successful band,  the Eagles .  The Grateful Dead  had their biggest hit in band history with " Touch of Grey ".

"Touch of Grey" is the band's only recording to ever reach the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Dead did crack the Hot 100 5 other times with " Alabama Getaway ", " The Music Never Stopped ", " Sugar Magnolia ", " Truckin' ", and " Uncle John's Band ".

As Road Trips, Vol. 4, No. 2 attests, the Grateful Dead certainly was on an upswing in 1988, one which would last for several years. Whether navigating the hilly terrain that linked " China Cat Sunflower " with " I Know You Rider "; the intoxicated, funky jazz that connected "Estimated Prophet" to "Eyes of the World"; or the frenetically propulsive bluegrass of "Cumberland Blues", the members of the Grateful Dead were fully in synch. Fueled by sobriety, new material, and — for the first time in its career —  a hit record , the outfit almost seemed to be making amends for the time it lost during the first half of the decade. Things were certainly good in the world of the Grateful Dead."

The February 13 and February 14 Dead shows were widely regarded as among the band's best concerts, even before the release of Dick's Picks Volume 4.  In addition to the evidence offered by Bear's Choice, high quality  soundboard   bootlegs  of the concerts had been in circulation for quite some time.  In a 1993 poll of Grateful Dead tape traders, based on the concert recordings then in circulation, the 2/13/70 show was ranked #2 on the list of all-time favorite Dead tapes, and 2/14/70 was #17.  (The May 8, 1977 concert at  Cornell University 's  Barton Hall  received the top ranking.)  The same poll rated the 2/13/70 versions of " Dark Star ", "The Other One", and " Turn On Your Love Light " as the best ever.  (The "Dark Star" played on August 27, 1972, in Veneta, Oregon, was ranked #2.  The February 27, 1969 version from the Fillmore West, included in  Live/Dead , was #9.)
103_3	CAR_8c5cbec4c393fed455e0d15e04b2e145dc8849f6	At the time of its release,  Robert Christgau  wrote that side two of the double album "contains the finest rock improvisation ever recorded." A landmark live album, that captured the Grateful Dead's improvisations at their best,  AllMusic  would write that "Few recordings have ever represented the essence of an artist in performance as faithfully as Live/Dead".  Drummer  Bill Kreutzmann  comments "It was our first live release and it remains one of our best-loved albums. Its appeal was that it took great 'you-had-to-be-there' live versions of songs like 'Dark Star' and 'The Eleven' and put them right in people’s living rooms." In 2003, the album was ranked number 244 on  Rolling Stone  magazine's list of  the 500 greatest albums of all time .
103_3	CAR_a77e6bd7565611caed7c9ff3eedbebd857c23b6c	The  Grateful Dead  recorded the song and performed it in concert 532 times, making it their seventh most often performed song. Versions of the song are included on the albums  Skull and Roses  (1971) and  Rare Cuts and Oddities 1966 . "Not Fade Away" was the last song of the second set (before the encores) played on the last night of  Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead , as the song has come to signify that the fans' love of the band and the band's love of the fans "will not fade away." 
103_3	CAR_b82665e22d929f32e6fbca9f0ce45f1ce27a9c3e	The Grateful Dead continued to grow their fanbase to nearly unmanagable levels in the second half of the 1980s. The party atmosphere of Grateful Dead shows drew in a new generation of fans, especially after they released " Touch of Grey " which surprisingly became a hit song on MTV in 1987.  They eventually began playing football stadiums, where fans turned the parking lots into campgrounds.
103_3	CAR_bbe3a220f7bf407f96f20f7090a9f74632a7c528	"Dark Star" is a  song  released as a  single  by the  Grateful Dead  on  Warner Bros.  records in 1968. It was written by lyricist  Robert Hunter  and composed by lead guitarist  Jerry Garcia ; however, compositional credit is sometimes extended to include  Phil Lesh ,  Bill Kreutzmann ,  Mickey Hart ,   Ron "Pigpen" McKernan , and  Bob Weir . "Dark Star" was an early Grateful Dead classic and became one of their most loved and anticipated numbers, often with the group using it as a vehicle for musical improvisation sessions that extended beyond the original structure of the song. The song is included in  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll  list and was ranked at number 57 on  Rolling Stone's  100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. "Dark Star" was often the basis for jamming during the Dead's live shows, allowing the band to employ techniques typical of improvisational jazz.

Their debut album had been recorded in just four days, and although it was not a major hit, it cracked the US Top 50 album chart and sold steadily, eventually going gold in 1971. For their second album, the Grateful Dead took a far more experimental approach, embarking on a marathon series of recording sessions lasting seven months, from September 1967 to March 1968. They started the album with  David Hassinger , who had produced their first album, but he quit the project in frustration in December 1967 while they were recording in New York City (although he is co-credited with band on the album). The group and their concert sound engineer  Dan Healy  then took over production of the album themselves, taking the unusual step of intermixing studio material with multitrack recordings of their concerts.  Anthem of the Sun  proved to be the least successful of the Grateful Dead's 1960s albums—it sold poorly, the extended sessions put the band more than $100,000 in debt to the label, and Warner Bros. executive Joe Smith later described it as "the most unreasonable project with which we have ever involved ourselves".

It became unexpectedly popular, achieving  double platinum certification  in the U.S.  It reached #6 on the  Billboard 200  chart, the Grateful Dead's only top ten album. The peppy " Touch of Grey " peaked at #9 on the  Billboard Hot 100 , the band's only top forty single; it also became a frequently played  music video  on  MTV . "Hell in a Bucket" and "Throwing Stones" (for which videos were also made) also achieved significant  album-oriented rock  radio airplay.

They soon formed their own record group, Grateful Dead Records. Later that year, they released their next studio album, the jazz-influenced  Wake of the Flood . It became their biggest commercial success thus far.  Meanwhile, capitalizing on Flood’s success, the band soon went back to the studio, and the next year, 1974, released another album,  From the Mars Hotel . Not long after that album’s release however, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live  touring .

Weir, Lesh and Kreutzmann had all been in the band from its inception in 1965 until its demise in 1995 while Hart had a tenure of 25, non-consecutive, years. Instances in the full reunions category are performances where all four of these members played together. Partial reunions are performances where only three of them performed together.

He took over de facto frontman duties in concert and began to reintroduce material originally chosen by McKernan into the Dead's live set after his death. Weir began singing "Good Lovin'" with the Dead in 1973, and the group recorded the song on 1978's  Shakedown Street . "Turn On Your Love Light" was revived in 1981, with Weir singing lead. He also revived the 1960s standard "Big Boy Pete", originally sung by McKernan, as a one-off in 1985.  Jimmy Reed 's " Big Boss Man ", covered by the group on  Grateful Dead (Skull and Roses)  with McKernan singing lead, was revived by Garcia and performed occasionally through the 1980s and 90s.

The surviving members created a band called  The Other Ones  (they used the name " The Dead " for some tours in the following decade). During the same period, Phish rose to prominence, and bands such as String Cheese Incident and Blues Traveler became successful. Many stranded Deadheads moved over to Phish scene, which was at the time the top touring Jam band behind the Grateful Dead. Phish began a new chapter in their career after the demise of the Grateful Dead, as the band became more popular, and more recognized as mainstream, over the next five years.

Though he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or "spokesman" of the group.

Drummer  Bill Kreutzmann  was added and the band evolved into the Warlocks. Around 1965, McKernan urged the rest of the Warlocks to switch to electric instruments. Bassist  Phil Lesh  joined soon after, and they became the  Grateful Dead . The group were keen to involve McKernan in the band, as he was the group's original leader and was considered the best singer and frontman.
103_4	CAR_7b8491230ffef9f38b31faa97e8302640b066510	The band that set the template for future Jam bands was the  Grateful Dead , founded in 1965 by legendary  San Francisco -based guitarist  Jerry Garcia . Although their studio albums enjoyed only modest success, and they were never an AM-radio favorite, "The Dead" attracted an enormous cult following, mainly on the strength of their live performances (and live albums). Drawing inspiration from  Eric Clapton 's short-lived (but influential) supergroup  Cream , the band specialized, in concert, in improvisational jamming. They played long two-set shows, and gave their fans a different experience every night, with varying setlists, evolving songs, creative segues and extended instrumentals. Their loyal fans ("Deadheads") followed them on tour from city to city, and a hippie subculture developed around the band, complete with psychedelic clothes, a black market in concert-related products, and drug paraphernalia. The band toured regularly for nearly three decades, except for a hiatus from 1974-1976. The eventual heirs to this "Shakedown Street" fan culture,  Phish , formed in 1983 at the University of Vermont in Burlington. They solidified their lineup in 1985, and began their career with a few Grateful Dead songs in their repertoire.
103_4	CAR_9af6f01f9e9df2b712001994f6722181617d9a4e	The Grateful Dead formed in the  San Francisco Bay Area  in 1965 amid the  counterculture of the 1960s .  They had many musical influences, and their music evolved to a great degree over time.  They made extensive use of  improvisation , and are considered one of the originators of  jam band  music.  The founding members were  Jerry Garcia  on  guitar  and  vocals ,  Bob Weir  on guitar and vocals,  Phil Lesh  on  bass  and vocals,  Bill Kreutzmann  on  drums , and  Ron "Pigpen" McKernan  on  organ ,  harmonica ,  percussion , and vocals.  Pigpen died in 1973, but the other four remained with the band for its entire 30-year history.  Second drummer  Mickey Hart  was also in the band for most of that time.  Others who were band members at different times were  keyboardists   Tom Constanten ,  Keith Godchaux ,  Brent Mydland , and  Vince Welnick , and vocalist  Donna Jean Godchaux .

The founding members were  Jerry Garcia  ( guitar , vocals),  Bob Weir  (guitar, vocals),  Ron "Pigpen" McKernan  ( keyboards ,  harmonica , vocals),  Phil Lesh  ( bass , vocals), and  Bill Kreutzmann  ( drums ). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs.  Drummer  Mickey Hart  and nonperforming lyricist  Robert Hunter  joined in 1967.  With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are  Tom Constanten  (keyboards; 1968–1970),  John Perry Barlow  (lyrics; 1971–1995),  Keith Godchaux  (keyboards; 1971–1979),  Donna Godchaux  (vocals; 1972–1979),  Brent Mydland  (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and  Vince Welnick  (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995).

By the end of 1966, Garcia had improved his musical skills and wanted to assert himself more as a leader and musical director, changing the band's direction and reducing McKernan's contributions. In 1967, drummer  Mickey Hart  joined the Grateful Dead, followed by classically trained keyboardist  Tom Constanten  in 1968, further changing the group's style. Constanten often replaced McKernan on keyboards in the studio, as McKernan found it difficult to adapt to the new material that Garcia and Lesh composed for the band.

103_5	CAR_2056058ced07520cdb2f32990aa92642d79d8be0	Less than a year after he lost most of his finger, his father died. Vacationing with his family near  Arcata  in Northern California in 1947, Garcia's father went fly fishing in the  Trinity River , part of the  Six Rivers National Forest . Not long after entering the river, Garcia's father slipped on a rock, lost his balance and was swept away by the river's rapids. He drowned before other fishermen could reach him. Although Garcia claimed he saw his father fall into the river, Dennis McNally, author of the book A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead, argues Garcia formed the memory after hearing others repeat the story. Blair Jackson, who wrote Garcia: An American Life, lends weight to McNally's claim. Jackson's evidence: a local newspaper article describing Jose's death failed to mention Garcia was present when his father died.

During this time drummer Bill Kreutzmann and keyboardist Brent Mydland formed the band Go Ahead. The two had performed briefly in a band called Kokomo during the summer of 1985.  Go Ahead played a number of gigs during December 1986 after which the Grateful Dead had resumed performing.
103_5	CAR_4af39fca8fdc57acb1d4b7343e79fc8e7515965c	On August 9, 1995, at 4:23 am, eight days after his 53rd birthday, Garcia was found dead in his room at the rehabilitation clinic. The cause of death was a  heart attack . Garcia had long struggled with  drug addiction , weight problems,  sleep apnea , heavy smoking, and diabetes—all of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that upon hearing of Garcia's death, "I was struck numb; I had lost my oldest surviving friend, my brother." Garcia's funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in  Belvedere . It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends (including former basketball player  Bill Walton  and musician  Bob Dylan ) and his widow Deborah Koons, who barred Garcia's former wives from the ceremony.

103_5	CAR_6a74b83e7acabf953237b8730052ee54f368cdaf	Precipitated by an unhealthy weight, bad eating habits, and recent drug use, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later. He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: "Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of  protoplasm  that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off." Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he quickly recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year. Garcia frequently saw a woman named Manasha Matheson during this period. Together they produced Garcia's fourth and final child, a girl named Keelin Noel Garcia, who was born December 20, 1987. (Jerry, Keelin, and Manasha toured and shared a home together as a family until 1993.) After Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album  In the Dark  in 1987, which became their best selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health and a successful album, the band's energy and chemistry peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
103_5	CAR_71417d7bd6a2bec54bec36719dec646d98e2d932	Keyboardist  Brent Mydland  died of a drug overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists  Vince Welnick  and  Bruce Hornsby . The power of Hornsby's keys musically drove Garcia to new heights on stage. As the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use narcotics again. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited  Phil Lesh  over to his home in  San Rafael , California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a  methadone  clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.
103_5	CAR_98f34d94d83e35653ab09de97f5cd02306b506d5	Garcia experienced several tragedies during his youth. At age four, while the family was vacationing in the  Santa Cruz Mountains , two-thirds of Garcia's right middle finger was accidentally cut off. Garcia and his brother Tiff were chopping wood. Jerry steadied a piece of wood with his finger, but Tiff miscalculated and the axe severed most of Jerry's middle finger. After his mother wrapped his hand in a towel, Garcia's father drove him over 30  miles to the nearest hospital. A few weeks later, Garcia — who had not looked at his finger since the accident — was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.

Refusing to go to the hospital, he instead enlisted the aid of  acupuncturist  Yen Wei Choong and a licensed doctor to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate. Garcia then reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight. He also became a vegetarian.

Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. His drug habits caused him to lose his liveliness on stage. After beginning to gradually curtail his opiate usage in 1985, Garcia slipped into a  diabetic coma  for several days in July 1986. After he recovered, the band released  In the Dark  in July 1987, which resulted as their best selling studio album release, and also produced their only top-10 chart single, " Touch of Grey ". Also that year, the group  toured  with  Bob Dylan , as documented on the album  Dylan & the Dead .

It fused improvisation,  avant-garde jazz , and  free jazz  with the  psychedelic  rock of the 1960s. Lloyd was invited to play with pop and rock acts such as  the Doors ,  the Byrds ,  Aashish  and Pranesh Khan, and  the Beach Boys .  Miles Davis  and other jazz figures were influenced. The Quartet also shared billing with  Jimi Hendrix ,  Janis Joplin ,  Cream , the  Grateful Dead , and  Jefferson Airplane .

It was released in October 1970 under the title  Blows Against the Empire , and credited to "Paul Kantner/Jefferson Starship". This "prototype" version of  Jefferson Starship  included  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash ,  Grateful Dead  members  Jerry Garcia ,  Bill Kreutzmann , and  Mickey Hart , and Airplane members  Grace Slick ,  Joey Covington , and  Jack Casady . Blows Against the Empire was the first rock album nominated for the Hugo science fiction award. Kantner and Slick also recorded additional solo albums in the early 1970s.

The album was recorded in  stereo quadraphonic  sound and featured guest performances by members of the  Grateful Dead , including  Jerry Garcia  playing treated guitar and  Phil Lesh  playing electronic  Alembic   bass .  David Crosby ,  Grace Slick  and other members of the  Jefferson Airplane  also appear on the album.
103_6	CAR_24d5fc1f33f9b9238859cf63bbb2136797b96c9f	Despite its commercial success, the Airplane was plagued by intra-group fighting, causing the band to begin splintering at the height of its success. Part of the problem was manager  Bill Graham , who wanted the group to do more touring and more recording. During the transitional period of the early 1970s, as the Airplane started to come apart, Kantner recorded  Blows Against The Empire , a concept album featuring an ad hoc group of musicians whom he dubbed Jefferson Starship.  This earliest edition of Jefferson Starship included members of  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  (David Crosby and  Graham Nash ), members of the  Grateful Dead , ( Jerry Garcia ,  Bill Kreutzmann  and  Mickey Hart ), as well as some of the other members of Jefferson Airplane ( Grace Slick ,  Joey Covington  and  Jack Casady ).
103_6	CAR_2e89b7e7e77b0316ee6d6fb3ac01c6d2da61f328	Garcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of  Jefferson Airplane  (most notably  Surrealistic Pillow , Garcia being listed as their "spiritual advisor"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on "Today," played on "Plastic Fantastic Lover" and "Comin' Back to Me" on that album. Others include  Tom Fogerty ,  David Bromberg , Robert Hunter (Liberty, on Relix Records),  Paul Pena ,  Peter Rowan ,  Warren Zevon ,  Country Joe McDonald ,  Pete Sears ,  Ken Nordine ,  Ornette Coleman ,  Bruce Hornsby ,  Bob Dylan ,  It's a Beautiful Day , and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD  Blue Incantation  by guitarist  Sanjay Mishra , making it his last studio collaboration.
103_6	CAR_3695ff0445e753e0158129d726c8fa22306d30be	According to  Jefferson Airplane 's  Spencer Dryden , the idea for "a kind of Woodstock West" began when he and bandmate  Jorma Kaukonen  discussed the staging of a free concert with the Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones in Golden Gate Park. Referring to the Stones, Dryden said, "Next to the  Beatles  they were the biggest rock and roll band in the world, and we wanted them to experience what we were experiencing in  San Francisco ." As plans were being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida, believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in  Paul Kantner 's account because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of  Haight-Ashbury  and the police was manifested in obstructiveness.  Sears Point Raceway  was suggested, but its owners wanted $100,000 in  escrow  from the Rolling Stones. At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in  Alameda County  for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of  Miami  on December 5. Kantner said the location was taken in a spirit of desperation: "There was no way to control it, no supervision or order." According to  Grace Slick , "The vibes were bad. Something was very peculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. It was that kind of hazy, abrasive and unsure day. I had expected the loving vibes of Woodstock but that wasn't coming at me. This was a whole different thing."

Her band  Mother Earth  played the   Fillmore Auditorium , sharing bills with the  Grateful Dead ,  Jefferson Airplane ,  Janis Joplin , and  Jimi Hendrix . It was during this period that Nelson wrote and recorded, with Mother Earth, on the album Living with the Animals, her signature song "Down So Low", later covered by  Linda Ronstadt ,  Etta James , and  Diamanda Galás .
103_6	CAR_4d26aa60f5c4a3f53496c3ee1fda413a526f488d	In 1969, Garcia played pedal steel on three notable outside recordings: the track "The Farm" on the  Jefferson Airplane  album  Volunteers ; and the  hit singles  " One Toke Over The Line " by  Brewer and Shipley  and " Teach Your Children " by  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  from their album  Déjà Vu , released in 1970. Garcia played on the latter album in exchange for harmony lessons for the Grateful Dead, who were at the time recording  Workingman's Dead .
103_6	CAR_51ba1df36e0ee964b45708d292bbe934b5478e0f	Luke and the Apostles were asked to open for  Jefferson Airplane  and  The Grateful Dead  by Bill Graham (of Fillmore East / Filmore West fame) for a week-long stint at Toronto's  O'Keefe Centre  in 1967.  Jerry Garcia  apparently liked the sound of McKenna's Les Paul so much he bought it (reportedly it's the black Les Paul Garcia once posed with when he was being photographed for  Rolling Stone magazine ).  An invitation to visit New York to open with the Dead followed and the Apostles recorded a single for  Elektra Records  (produced by The Doors'  Paul Rothchild ). Unfortunately inconclusive contract negotiations and conflicting priorities saw the band returning to Canada and eventually disbanding.

This included two songs recorded in 1964 with future  Jefferson Airplane  guitarist  Jorma Kaukonen . On the bootleg, McKernan played  acoustic guitar  and  piano , instruments he seldom used with the Dead.
103_6	CAR_5c39276775abe5c6c90c8c90ed7aacd8aae613ae	Casady's appetite for playing led him to do extensive moonlighting during his Airplane tenure. Not only did he perform live on stage with Jimi Hendrix during 1968, he also played bass on the  Jimi Hendrix  song " Voodoo Chile ", from the  Electric Ladyland  album released in the same year (some copies of the album misspell his name as Cassidy). He also occasionally played with other key San Francisco bands  Grateful Dead ,  Country Joe and the Fish  and James and the Good Brothers. Furthermore, he was a member of two short-lived splinter groups, Mickey and the Heartbeats (with  Jerry Garcia  and  Mickey Hart ) and Jack Casady and the Degenerates, featuring friend from teen years  Danny Gatton , as well as Jorma. Neither of these groups ever recorded, though live tapes are in circulation. Later, Casady was to appear on  David Crosby 's  If I Could Only Remember My Name  (1971),  Roky Erickson 's album Don't Slander Me (1982) and  Warren Zevon 's  Transverse City  (1989). He also produced Jorma Kaukonen's first solo album, the critically acclaimed  Quah , in 1975.
103_6	CAR_6387b4114f2ab73d195545f7529a85c21ef52fbc	The late 1960s saw San Francisco and  Hollywood  rise as the center for psychedelic rock and a mecca for  hippie s.  Haight-Ashbury  became a countercultural capital, and bands like  Jefferson Airplane ,  Loading Zone ,  Quicksilver Messenger Service ,  The Ace of Cups ,  Country Joe and the Fish ,  Santana ,  The Charlatans ,  Big Brother & the Holding Company , and the  Grateful Dead  helped to launch the blues- and folk-rock scene; other bands, like  Moby Grape  and The  Flamin' Groovies  used a more country-influenced sound, while  Cold Blood  and  Sons of Champlin  incorporated R&B and  Orkustra  played a sort of free-form psychedelia. Of all these bands, the Grateful Dead were undoubtedly the longest-lasting of all. They continued recording and performing for several decades under the leadership of  Jerry Garcia , experimenting with a wide variety of folk, country, and  bluegrass , and becoming a part of the  jam band  phenomenon.
103_6	CAR_66c36828b6d3b79b115e3e888eb40f6fba4718c3	San Francisco has often hosted influential  rock music  trends, starting with the  San Francisco Sound  during the 1960s. Two of the most influential bands from that era, the  Grateful Dead  and  Jefferson Airplane , started out in San Francisco in 1965. Other groups include rockers  Creedence Clearwater Revival ,  Santana , and  Journey , seminal  punk  band the  Dead Kennedys , and  alternative metal  band  Faith No More . It is the birthplace of  thrash metal  with bands such as  Metallica ,  Testament ,  Exodus ,  Slayer ,  Death Angel ,  Megadeth  and latterly  Machine Head .  Punk ,  electronica ,  industrial ,  goth , and  rave  activity 1980s and early 1990s, was also somewhat influential.  Gentrification  during the late 1990s is said to have forced many performers to move away. However, San Francisco, especially in the  Fillmore  and  Hunters Point  districts, is the home of numerous rappers, including Messy Marv,  RBL Posse ,  Rappin' 4-Tay , HughEMC,  San Quinn ,  Andre Nickatina ,  Big Rich ,  JT the Bigga Figga , Ant Rich 415, and  Paris . San Francisco DJs and electronic musicians are credited with defining the laid-back, dub-influenced sound of the West Coast  house music . Prominent DJs and artists include  Kaskade ,  Miguel Migs ,  Mark Farina , and  DJ Garth .  Dub Mission  is among the city's regular music parties.
103_6	CAR_6cd112e8d936a23c8ed26efeb3e8b4a6a919317d	Stockhausen was influential within pop and rock music as well.  Frank Zappa  acknowledges Stockhausen in the liner notes of  Freak Out! , his 1966 debut with  The Mothers of Invention . On the back of  The Who 's second LP released in the US, " Happy Jack ", their primary composer and guitarist  Pete Townshend , is said to have "an interest in Stockhausen".  Rick Wright  and  Roger Waters  of  Pink Floyd  also acknowledge Stockhausen as an influence (; ). San Francisco psychedelic groups  Jefferson Airplane  and the  Grateful Dead  are said to have done the same ; Stockhausen himself says the former band included students of  Luciano Berio , and the Grateful Dead were "well orientated toward new music" . Founding members of Cologne-based experimental band  Can ,  Irmin Schmidt  and  Holger Czukay , both studied with Stockhausen at the Cologne Courses for New Music . German electronic pioneers  Kraftwerk  also say they studied with Stockhausen , and Icelandic vocalist  Björk  has acknowledged Stockhausen's influence (; ; ). 
103_6	CAR_76159f6938afacb767243725b99151a6984534f8	By some accounts, the  Hells Angels  were hired as security by the management of the Rolling Stones, on the recommendation of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane (who both had previously used the Angels for security at performances without incident), for $500 worth of beer. This story has been denied by some parties who were directly involved. According to the road manager of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US Tour  Sam Cutler , "the only agreement there ever was ... the Angels would make sure nobody tampered with the generators, but that was the extent of it. But there was no way 'They're going to be the police force' or anything like that. That's all  bollocks ." The deal was made at a meeting including Cutler, Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully and Pete Knell, a member of the Hells Angels' San Francisco chapter.  According to Cutler, the arrangement was that all the bands were supposed to share the $500 beer cost, "[but] the person who paid it was me, and I never got it back, to this day.”
103_6	CAR_76a45fdb6c5a01e11c1ff6acebaa2c6e754bf886	The music scene, especially  jazz fusion , but also  rock music  and  disco  thrived in the city in the 1970s, and from the 1970s, onwards San Francisco also became a major focal point in the North American and international  punk ,  thrash metal , and  rave  scenes. In 1967, thousands of young people had entered the  Haight-Ashbury  district during what became known as the  Summer of Love . The  San Francisco Sound  emerged as an influential force in  rock music , with such acts as  Jefferson Airplane  and the  Grateful Dead  achieving international prominence. These groups blurred the boundaries between folk, rock and jazz traditions and further developed rock's lyrical content. The 1972 album  Graham Nash David Crosby   was partly recorded in  Wally Heider 's studios in San Francisco and Los Angeles. When in the 1970s, the rise of disco was one of the biggest musical genres of the decade (ranging from funk, Latin and soul vocal music supported by bass lines and electronic synthesizers), the band led by San Francisco’s  Steve Miller  Band turned out, in 1973 in San Francisco, major musical hits such as the “The Joker,” “Fly Like An Eagle” and “Jet Airliner” and “ Don’t Stop Believin”.Jazz clubs across the city increasingly featured jazz fusion artists who moved away from traditional jazz, embracing a range of influences including Brazilian musical forms;  bongo  playing for instance became one of the musical icons of the city during this period.  
103_6	CAR_784152632b693ca58a4061d46a355b58d864fa85	The group's second LP,  Surrealistic Pillow , recorded in Los Angeles with producer  Rick Jarrard  in only thirteen days at a cost of $8,000, launched the Airplane to international fame. Released in February 1967, the LP entered the  Billboard 200  album chart on March 25 and remained there for over a year, peaking at No. 3. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a  gold disc . The name "Surrealistic Pillow" was suggested by the album's "shadow producer",  Jerry Garcia , when he mentioned that, as a whole, the album sounded "as Surrealistic as a pillow is soft". Although RCA Victor would not acknowledge Garcia's considerable contributions to the album with a "Producer" credit, he is listed in the album's credits as "spiritual advisor".
103_6	CAR_7e9143c454cc3e210b520865f56c83d2e1b348bc	In the mid-1960s, the Fillmore Auditorium became the focal point for  psychedelic music  and  counterculture  in general, with such acts as  The Grateful Dead ,  The Steve Miller Band ,  Jefferson Airplane ,  Quicksilver Messenger Service ,  The Doors ,  Jimi Hendrix Experience ,  The Byrds ,  Big Brother and the Holding Company ,  Santana ,  Frank Zappa 's  The Mothers of Invention ,  The Allman Brothers Band ,  Creedence Clearwater Revival , and British acts  The Who ,  Cream ,  Led Zeppelin , and  Pink Floyd   all performing at the venue. Besides  rock , Graham also featured non-rock acts such as  Lenny Bruce ,  Miles Davis ,  Rahsaan Roland Kirk ,  Charles Lloyd ,  Aretha Franklin , and  Otis Redding  as well as  poetry readings . The  Grateful Dead  were regulars at The Fillmore, having played a total of 51 concerts from 1965 through 1969.

David Crosby  (processed voice and electric 12-string guitar), and members of the  Jefferson Airplane   Grace Slick  (processed voice),  Spencer Dryden  (processed percussion), and  David Freiberg  (processed voice) also appear on the album.
103_6	CAR_800d9943daf5d6de33a2fc44759683115eee3915	"Blood-Stained Banders" was thus the proximate source for what was taught to guitarist  Jorma Kaukonen  by folk singer  Roger Perkins  and friend  Tom Hobson  in the early 1960s.  Kaukonen had grown up in  Washington, D.C.  and around the world as the son of a diplomat, then had migrated to the  San Francisco Bay Area  where he became a lover of various  folk revival  styles, especially  acoustic blues  and  downhome blues .  The song became part of Kaukonen's repertoire as he played around San Francisco clubs, well before he joined Jefferson Airplane.  Kaukonen continued to evolve musically; the enticement of exploring the technology around the electric guitar led him to join the Airplane.  An evolving rendition of Kaukonen's imagining of the song is captured on a circulating recording of his May 21, 1968, performance at the  Carousel Ballroom  in San Francisco during a jam session of area musicians led by  Jerry Garcia .
103_6	CAR_8259489edc74d9592294babe003ed58c8ac5a757	Psychedelic rock particularly took off in California's emerging music scene as groups followed the Byrds from folk to folk rock from 1965. The psychedelic life style had already developed in San Francisco and particularly prominent products of the scene were  the Grateful Dead ,  Country Joe and the Fish ,  the Great Society  and Jefferson Airplane. The Byrds rapidly progressed from purely folk rock in 1966 with their single " Eight Miles High ", widely taken to be a reference to drug use. In Britain, an influential band in the genre were The Yardbirds, who, with Jeff Beck as their guitarist, increasingly moved into psychedelic territory, adding up-tempo improvised "rave ups", Gregorian chant and world music influences to songs including "Still I'm Sad" (1965) and "Over Under Sideways Down" (1966). From 1966 the  UK underground  scene based in North London supported new acts including  Pink Floyd ,  Traffic  and  Soft Machine . The same year saw Donovan's folk-influenced hit album  Sunshine Superman , considered one of the first psychedelic pop records, as well as the débuts of blues rock bands Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, whose extended guitar-heavy jams became a key feature of psychedelia.
103_6	CAR_8d37a56d9e2fce94b67c0d8f5669a245cec199a5	From 1975 to 1995, the Jerry Garcia Band was the main musical side project of  Jerry Garcia  of the  Grateful Dead .  The band underwent many personnel changes over the years.  Let It Rock features the original lineup of the Jerry Garcia Band, which lasted from August through December of 1975 — Garcia on  guitar  and  vocals ,  Nicky Hopkins  on  piano ,  John Kahn  on  bass , and  Ron Tutt  on  drums .  Kahn and Tutt had also been members of Garcia's previous band,  Legion of Mary .  A recording of that band was released in 2005 as  Legion of Mary: The Jerry Garcia Collection, Vol. 1 .  Hopkins was a highly regarded  session musician  who had played with  The Beatles ,  The Rolling Stones ,  The Who ,  The Kinks ,  Jefferson Airplane , and  Quicksilver Messenger Service .
103_6	CAR_97d8543a042d708439f8e6f1be860a12dc657c06	Each San Francisco band had its characteristic sound, but enough commonalities existed that there was a regional identity. By 1967, fresh and adventurous improvisation during live performance (which many heard as being epitomized by the Grateful Dead and by the "cross-talk" guitar work of  Moby Grape ) was one characteristic of the San Francisco Sound. A louder, more prominent role for the electric bass—typically with a melodic or semi-melodic approach, and using a plush, pervasive tone—was another feature. This questing bass quality has been wryly characterized as a "roving" (rather than the conventional "stay-at-home") style. In jazz it had been exuberantly pioneered by numerous musicians—and such bassists as  Charles Mingus ,  Scott LaFaro , and  Steve Swallow  had taken it into very exploratory places. A musician who was a leading example of this,  Jack Casady  of  Jefferson Airplane  (and the offshoot  Hot Tuna ) pioneered the approach, perhaps best represented on the album  Bless Its Pointed Little Head .  Phil Lesh , bassist with the Grateful Dead, furthered this sound. Lesh had developed his style on the foundation of having studied classical, brass-band, jazz, and modernist music on the violin and later the trumpet.

The concert itself was prominent for Jefferson Airplane filled the bill with contemporary band, the  Grateful Dead . It also includes tracks from their album,  Volunteers  before the album's release in November 1969. Included are three bonus tracks that were not a part of the concert.
103_6	CAR_9bf4c9e30b33d016648146b6b4e191fe4275bf3d	Some controversy exists as to the role of  Grateful Dead  guitarist  Jerry Garcia  in the making of the album. His reputed presence on several tracks is denied by producer Rick Jarrard, but he is credited on the RCA label copy, as well as received credits on the  Flight Log  compilation and the  Jefferson Airplane Loves You  box set. In his sleeve notes for Early Flight  - the 1974 compilation album of previously unreleased material - the band's sometime manager Bill Thompson writes only that Garcia was, "listed as 'spiritual advisor' on the album cover [and] played one of the guitars", on "In The Morning", a track recorded at the Surrealistic Pillow sessions, but first included on the album on the 2003 reissue. Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he had played the high lead on "Today", played on "Plastic Fantastic Lover" and "Comin' Back to Me", and that he had arranged and essentially rewritten "Somebody to Love". He also played on two songs not released until the reissue ("JPP McStep B Blues"and "In the Morning") and may have played on "How Do You Feel". Kaukonen said that Garcia was essentially the producer who arranged the songs. A comment by Garcia about the music being "as surrealistic as a pillow" also reportedly inspired the album title.
103_6	CAR_9f451799e1899deec04a8d61ed05680fd3c4017d	One of the early concerts Graham sponsored, with  Chet Helms  hired to promote it, featured the  Paul Butterfield Blues Band . The concert was an overwhelming success and Graham saw an opportunity with the band. Early the next morning, Graham's secretary called the band's manager,  Albert Grossman , and obtained exclusive rights to promote them. Shortly thereafter,  Chet Helms  arrived at Graham's office, asking how Graham could have cut him out of the deal. Graham pointed out that Helms would not have known about it unless he had tried to do the same thing to Graham. He advised Helms to "get up early" in the future. Graham produced shows attracting elements of America's now legendary  1960s counterculture  such as the  Jefferson Airplane ,  Big Brother and the Holding Company ,  Country Joe and the Fish ,  Lawrence Ferlinghetti , the improv group The Committee,  The Fugs ,  Allen Ginsberg , and a particular favorite of Graham's, the  Grateful Dead . He was the  manager  of the Jefferson Airplane during 1967 and 1968. His staff's amount of resourcefulness, success, popularity, and personal contacts with artists and fans alike was one reason Graham became the top rock concert promoter in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The  San Francisco Sound  emerged as an influential force in  rock music , with such acts as  Jefferson Airplane  and the  Grateful Dead  achieving international prominence. These groups blurred the boundaries between folk, rock and jazz traditions and further developed rock's lyrical content.

Paul Kantner  of  Jefferson Airplane  saw him play as a 16-year-old, and invited Chaquico to join him for a series of recording sessions and concerts. During this period members of the Airplane, the  Grateful Dead ,  Quicksilver Messenger Service  and  Crosby, Stills and Nash  often appeared together in concerts and recordings, and Chaquico played alongside a number of musicians including  Jerry Garcia ,  David Crosby ,  David Freiberg  and  Carlos Santana . His first recording was with Kantner and  Grace Slick  in 1971 on their  Sunfighter  duo album.
103_6	CAR_ab56e0308103a0305953c26e641f1e8bf85890a2	"Today" is a  folk rock  ballad written by  Marty Balin  and  Paul Kantner  from the band  Jefferson Airplane . It first appeared on their breakthrough album,  Surrealistic Pillow , with a live version later appearing on the expanded rerelease of  Bless Its Pointed Little Head . Marty Balin said, "I wrote it to try to meet  Tony Bennett . He was recording in the next studio. I admired him, so I thought I'd write him a song. I never got to meet him, but the Airplane ended up doing it." Jerry Garcia plays the simple, repetitive but poignant lead guitar riff on the song.
103_6	CAR_ace71c2a8dc1da90ee921f443ff4e0f0353fbcc1	In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including  Quicksilver Messenger Service ,  Jefferson Airplane , early  Jefferson Starship ,  Old and in the Way ,  Janis Joplin ,  Big Brother and the Holding Company ,  Taj Mahal ,  Santana ,  Miles Davis ,  the Flying Burrito Brothers ,  Jimi Hendrix ,  Johnny Cash , and  Blue Cheer .
103_6	CAR_ad3dad0aa368a159b276e94d7038fe7ce149b036	Balin met folk musician  Paul Kantner  at another local club, The Drinking Gourd. Kantner, a native San Franciscan, had started out performing on the Bay Area folk circuit in the early 1960s, alongside fellow folkies  Jerry Garcia ,  David Crosby  and  Janis Joplin . Kantner has cited folk groups like the  Kingston Trio  and the  Weavers  as strong early influences. He briefly moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1964 to work in a folk duo with future Airplane/Starship member  David Freiberg  (who subsequently joined  Quicksilver Messenger Service ).
103_6	CAR_bbb6f02a3c13820d0dbdb7fbfb986a23745be08d	In 1970, while  Jefferson Airplane  was on break from touring, singer-guitarist  Paul Kantner  recorded  Blows Against the Empire . This was a concept album featuring an ad hoc group of musicians (centered on Kantner,  Grace Slick ,  Joey Covington , and  Jack Casady  of Jefferson Airplane;  Crosby & Nash ; and members of  Grateful Dead  and  Santana ) credited on the LP as "Paul Kantner & Jefferson Starship", marking the first use of that name. This agglomeration was informally known as the  Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra , a moniker later used on a Kantner album in the early 1980s.
103_6	CAR_c2b767f83b621c417ff359ad1241e25847a5bf03	Psychedelic rock was a hard, driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of  San Francisco, California . Though Jefferson Airplane was the only psychedelic San Francisco band to have a major national hit, with 1967's "Somebody to Love" and "White Rabbit", the  Grateful Dead , a folk, country and bluegrass-flavored  jam band , "embodied all the elements of the San Francisco scene and came... to represent the counterculture to the rest of the country"; the Grateful Dead also became known for introducing the counterculture, and the rest of the country, to the ideas of people like  Timothy Leary , especially the use of hallucinogenic drugs like  LSD  for spiritual and philosophical purposes.
103_6	CAR_c3b8af761bbfe2b1e58d765ba198b464c3e733eb	This was the sixth album recorded by the group and the first to be wholly recorded in San Francisco, at  Wally Heider 's then state-of-the-art  16-track  studio. Guest musicians included  Jerry Garcia  on pedal steel guitar, veteran session pianist  Nicky Hopkins , future Airplane drummer Joey Covington on percussion,  David Crosby , and  Stephen Stills . It was one of the earliest 16-track recordings. The back cover of the album shows a picture of the MM-1000 professional 16-track tape recorder built by  Ampex  which was used to record the album.
103_6	CAR_c606d088775351b72a9f15b3ac4663012d90137e	Through concert promoter  Bill Graham , Coblentz became the legal representative for Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. Coblents recalled being invited to a dinner hosted by members of Jefferson Airplane where two  joints  were arranged next to each place setting. Coblentz managed the group's bank account, providing cash for  Grace Slick  to buy a  Mercedes Benz  that she totalled two days later. After efforts were made to block performances by the Grateful Dead at  Fillmore West  citing concerns that the auditorium posed a blight on a fine neighborhood, Coblentz arranged for a friend to observe a hotel across the street from the Fillmore used for prostitution and had photographs taken of police officers which were passed on to the Board of Permit Appeals, which decided in the end to approve the project.
103_6	CAR_c632b5f07b955786934a97789bdd225cc9a92558	Around the beginning of 1967  Bill Graham  took over from Bill Thompson as manager. In January the group  made their first visit to the East Coast. On January 14, alongside the  Grateful Dead  and  Quicksilver Messenger Service , Jefferson Airplane headlined the " Human Be-In ", the famous all-day "happening" in  Golden Gate Park , one of the key events leading up to the " Summer of Love ".
103_6	CAR_c779f14a9b8f045e877c55d94eb587c29bb20ab6	Lang was not among the producers of the December 6, 1969,  Altamont Free Concert  which some had billed as a "Woodstock West", but was asked by the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to assist with the last-moment re-location, from  Sears Point Raceway  to the  Altamont Speedway , near  Tracy, CA . The concert was initially planned for  Golden Gate Park , and was to feature  The Rolling Stones ,  Grateful Dead ,  Santana ,  Jefferson Airplane ,  The Flying Burrito Brothers , and  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young .  The City of San Francisco revoked the permits for the Golden Gate venue, ostensibly due to a  San Francisco 49ers  football game at  Kezar Stadium , located in the park, on the scheduled date.  The concert was subsequently moved to  Sears Point Raceway .  However, a dispute over film rights led to its cancellation.  Lang and Grateful Dead manager  Rock Scully  were then offered the Altamont Speedway – a rival to Sears Point Raceway – by owner Dick Carter. After the venue was set for the concert, Lang appeared, with his experience in moving the much larger Woodstock festival.  The venue was moved on December 4 to the racetrack with the concert starting December 6.
103_6	CAR_cfb7c14842198c208a72c7b7313300c459b8a89c	The album was recorded at Pacific High Recording Studios and  Wally Heider  Recording Studios in San Francisco by Kantner and Slick with a collection of musician friends that included members of  Jefferson Airplane  ( Jack Casady  and  Joey Covington ),  The Grateful Dead  ( Jerry Garcia ,  Bill Kreutzmann  and  Mickey Hart ),  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  ( David Crosby  and  Graham Nash ),  David Freiberg  of  Quicksilver Messenger Service  and  Harvey Brooks  of  Electric Flag . Also appearing was  Jorma Kaukonen 's brother  Peter Kaukonen , and Phill Sawyer, the engineer at Pacific High Recording studios.  The credit to Jefferson Starship reflected many things – the ad-hoc all-star line-up, the album being an evolutionary progression from Jefferson Airplane, and finally the story it relates of the hijacking of a starship.
103_6	CAR_d5836e2edf83b052fa615d1edd1ee7aeddbeef6a	Starting with a 1966 double bill of  Jefferson Airplane  and the  Paul Butterfield Blues Band , Bill Graham began to rent the venue occasionally for larger concerts that his nearby  Fillmore Auditorium  could not properly accommodate. After closing the  Fillmore West  in 1971, he began to hold regular weekend shows at Winterland. Various popular  rock  acts played there, including such bands and musicians as  Bruce Springsteen ,  The Rolling Stones ,  The J. Geils Band ,  The Who ,  Queen ,  Slade ,  Boston ,  Cream ,  Yes ,  Kiss ,  The Doors ,  Jimi Hendrix ,  Steppenwolf ,  Lynyrd Skynyrd ,  Styx ,  Van Morrison ,  The Allman Brothers Band ,  Grateful Dead ,  The Band ,  Big Brother and the Holding Company  w/  Janis Joplin ,  Jethro Tull ,  Pink Floyd ,  Ten Years After ,  Rush ,  Electric Light Orchestra ,  Genesis ,  Jefferson Airplane ,  Traffic ,  Golden Earring ,  Grand Funk Railroad ,  Humble Pie ,  Bob Seger  and the Silver Bullet Band,  Robin Trower ,  Emerson, Lake & Palmer ,  Sha Na Na ,  Loggins and Messina ,  Lee Michaels ,  Heart ,  Journey ,  Deep Purple ,  J.J. Cale ,  Spirit ,  Chambers Brothers ,  Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention ,  Foghat ,  Mountain ,  B.B. King , and  Elvis Costello .  Led Zeppelin  first performed their song  Whole Lotta Love  there. Many of the best-known rock acts from the 1960s and 1970s played at Winterland or played two blocks away across  Geary Boulevard  at the original  Fillmore Auditorium .  Peter Frampton  recorded parts of the fourth best-selling live album ever,  Frampton Comes Alive! , at Winterland. The Grateful Dead made Winterland their home base and  The Band  played their famous last show there on  Thanksgiving Day  1976. That concert, featuring numerous guest performers including  Neil Young ,  Eric Clapton ,  Bob Dylan ,  Joni Mitchell , and many others, was filmed by  Martin Scorsese  and released in theaters and as a soundtrack under the name  The Last Waltz . Winterland was also host to the  Sex Pistols ' final show on January 14, 1978. A concert at the music venue in 1973 hosted by the Grateful Dead was mentioned in the film  The Presidio  by Jay Austin ( Mark Harmon ) as being his first show and being a Deadhead since.
103_6	CAR_dbf98d6fb0a6c923cce8a3ade5ea4aecf07ba546	Among the notable acts to play the Fillmore East was  Jimi Hendrix . His album  Band of Gypsys  was recorded live on New Year's Day 1970.  The Kinks  played October 17th and 18th, 1969, supported by the  Bonzo Dog Band .  John Lennon  and  Yoko Ono  sat in with  Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention  at the theater on June 6, 1971. The  Allman Brothers Band  played so many shows at Fillmore East that they were sometimes called "Bill Graham's House Band"; additionally, the  Grateful Dead  played a total of 43 concerts at the theater from June 1968 through April 1971.  Jefferson Airplane  performed six shows and  Taj Mahal  played eight shows at the venue, while  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young  did four shows in September 1969 and six performances in June 1970.  Led Zeppelin  made four appearances in early 1969, opening for  Iron Butterfly . Amateur film footage of their January 31 performance can be viewed at the Led Zeppelin website.

103_6	CAR_ecd0c4ecca746af7e2ddc6cb2ddd9c527c924077	Rejection of mainstream culture was best embodied in the new genres of  psychedelic rock  music,  pop-art  and new explorations in  spirituality . Musicians who exemplified this era in the United Kingdom and United States included  The Beatles ,  Neil Young ,  Bob Dylan ,  The Grateful Dead ,  Jefferson Airplane ,  Jimi Hendrix ,  The Doors ,  Frank Zappa ,  The Rolling Stones ,  Velvet Underground ,  Janis Joplin ,  The Who ,  Joni Mitchell ,  The Kinks ,  Sly and the Family Stone  and, in their early years,  Chicago . New forms of musical presentation also played a key role in spreading the counterculture, with large outdoor rock festivals being the most noteworthy.  The climactic live statement on this occurred from August 15–18, 1969, with the  Woodstock  Music Festival held in  Bethel, New York —with 32 of  rock 's and  psychedelic rock 's most popular acts performing live outdoors during the sometimes rainy weekend to an audience of half a million people. ( Michael Lang  stated 400,000 attended, half of which did not have a ticket.) It is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history—with  Rolling Stone  calling it one of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll. According to Bill Mankin, "It seems fitting… that one of the most enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the ‘Woodstock Generation’."

Actually, programming in binary code since 1954, when computers were as big as a room. In 1964 he sponsored a music club in San Jose, The Offstage.  He hired the future members of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen, Jerry Garcia, Odetta, Jessie Fuller.He also liked to draw and created handbills for the music events, some of the very first artworks that would be come the music poster scene of the 60's.  
103_6	CAR_f1d5547b0194101115c9b2e3d7405f3fbbd2871b	The album was primarily recorded at RCA's  Studio A , in  Los Angeles , in only four days. The band had wanted to record the tracks in their hometown of  San Francisco , but  no recording studios in the area had modernized equipment at the time. The group picked  David Hassinger  to produce because he had worked as an engineer on the  Rolling Stones ' " (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction " and  Jefferson Airplane 's  Surrealistic Pillow  album (the latter on which  Jerry Garcia  had guested and suggested the album title). Due to demands by the band's label, Warner Brothers, four of the tracks were edited for length. Phil Lesh comments in his autobiography, "to my ear, the only track that sounds at all like we did at the time is Viola Lee Blues. ...None of us had any experience with performing for recording...the whole process felt a bit rushed." Bill Kreutzmann, in his autobiography, says of the songs, "their recorded versions failed to capture the energy that we had when we performed them live. ...We weren’t that good yet. We were still learning how to be a band."
103_6	CAR_f2acba04e1a778d637a9325055764f77925f8666	By the time the New Riders recorded their first album in late 1970, change was in the air. After Hart went on sabbatical from active touring in February 1971, former  Jefferson Airplane  drummer Spencer Dryden began a ten-year relationship with the group, eventually serving as the band's manager.  Their first album , eponymously titled, was released on Columbia Records in late 1971. It proved to be a moderate success comparable to the Dead's releases of the era, peaking at #39 on the  Billboard 200  chart. Entirely composed by Dawson (in comparison to the more egalitarian songwriting of later releases), the record was driven by Garcia's pedal-steel playing.
103_6	CAR_f48c4c1dd712b18fc56010a0e09e3ddef8527e0c	This era began in about 1965, when  The Matrix , the first folk club in San Francisco, opened; Jefferson Airplane, then a newly formed and unknown band, performed that night. Later that year, a band known as The Warlocks became the Grateful Dead, performing at  The Fillmore , which was to become a major musical venue in the area. Jefferson Airplane became the first San Francisco psychedelic band signed to a major label, followed soon after by  Sopwith Camel . In 1966, the first  acid test  was held, and the use of the drug  LSD  became a more prominent part of psychedelic rock, and music in general. One of the first albums from the scene was  Country Joe and the Fish 's  Electric Music for the Mind and Body  (1967). A year later, the band  Blue Cheer  released  Vincebus Eruptum , which launched a national hit with a  cover  of  Eddie Cochran 's " Summertime Blues "; Blue Cheer is now regarded as a progenitor of  heavy metal .
103_6	CAR_ff455edc1ad06b2ed4b9854462949ae82a1b442c	The Dinosaurs, formed in 1982, was a  Bay Area   supergroup  to emerge from the  psychedelic music  era of  San Francisco .  The core group consisted of Peter Albin of  Big Brother and the Holding Company ,  John Cipollina  of  Quicksilver Messenger Service ,  Spencer Dryden  of  Jefferson Airplane ,  Robert Hunter  of the  Grateful Dead ,  Barry Melton  of  Country Joe and The Fish  and keyboardist  Merl Saunders  from the Saunders-Garcia Band. Over time  Papa John Creach  of  Hot Tuna ,  Jack Casady  of  Jefferson Airplane ,  Nicky Hopkins ,  Dave Getz ,  Country Joe McDonald  and other prominent San Francisco musicians would guest star with the group.  In the 1990s  David LaFlamme  of  It's a Beautiful Day  and  Jerry Miller  of  Moby Grape  also toured with this group.
103_8	CAR_75dc05da2b429c0b68bbf3775f95b37e28c67e23	The name Cassidy was a known last name. Cassidy may have become a first name due to baby-boomer parents naming their children after '70s teen idol  David Cassidy  or the  Grateful Dead  song, " Cassidy ".

103_8	CAR_9de8964e257b549f775806cdc4e23b862f025b2f	This was a significant show in Dead history, being the first to use an essentially complete version of the  Wall of Sound  setup. A short-lived sound system, it was diminished after less than two years due to high maintenance, transportation and assembly costs. They began work on it in 1973 and smaller versions of the system were used right up until this show. Also featured are the first performances of " Scarlet Begonias " and " Cassidy ".
103_8	CAR_a2d0bd60045accf95a494c47d0b0f21e4ac4b1f6	From 1971 until 1995, Barlow wrote lyrics for the  Grateful Dead , mostly through his relationship with  Bob Weir . Among others, Barlow's songs include "Cassidy" (about  Neal Cassady  and Cassidy Law), "Estimated Prophet", "Black-Throated Wind", "Hell in a Bucket", "Mexicali Blues", "The Music Never Stopped", and "Throwing Stones".
103_8	CAR_c4da22510f569cbd882ce22bf9841650b372d1ce	In  Relix ,  Jeff Tamarkin  said, "Most Deadheads, regardless of when they came on board, have a favorite era or specific year, and for many, 1977 is high on the list. Refreshed from a year-plus-long hiatus, and with drummer  Mickey Hart  now back in the band after his own extended layoff, the Grateful Dead was tight and rejuvenated. This May show from Virginia is a slow-builder, picking up steam midway through the first set with  Bob Weir's  " Cassidy " and  Jerry Garcia's  "Loser" and never looking back. The band interplay in the "Lazy Lightning" > "Supplication" jam that follows is where the album kicks into high gear, but it’s the second set that's the keeper... As quintessentially delicious as the playing is in Richmond, the true highlights are Garcia and Weir’s vocal performances; both were singing with a newly discovered care for nuance that served the music supremely well. Judging by this first release in David Lemieux’s new series, Dave's Picks will be a worthy successor to the vaunted Dick's Picks series."
103_8	CAR_dddf59ab9b722bddfd309c34d905526674a193e7	The twosome hammered out such enduring songs as " Cassidy ", " Mexicali Blues ", and " Black-Throated Wind ", all three of which would remain in the repertoires of the Grateful Dead and Weir's varied solo projects for years to come. Other songs to emerge from the Weir-Barlow collaboration include "Let It Grow", "The Music Never Stopped", "Estimated Prophet", "I Need A Miracle", "Lost Sailor", "Saint of Circumstance", "Hell In A Bucket", "Throwing Stones" and "Picasso Moon".

Its climactic refrain, "What a long, strange trip it's been," has achieved widespread cultural use in the years since the song's release.

103_9	CAR_6a8a0a3c90f2c1afc70d640f0a4f85837c29b7c9	John Perry Barlow was born in  Sublette County, Wyoming  to parents Norman Barlow, a Republican state legislator, and his wife, Miriam. He grew up on the 22,000-acre Bar Cross Ranch near  Pinedale, Wyoming  that was founded by his great uncle in 1907 and attended elementary school in a one-room schoolhouse. At age 15, he became a student at the  Fountain Valley School  in Colorado. Barlow met  Bob Weir  there, who would later join the music group the  Grateful Dead . Weir and Barlow maintained contact throughout the years. As a frequent visitor to  Timothy Leary 's facility in  Millbrook, New York , Barlow introduced the musical group to Leary in 1967. In 1969, Barlow graduated with high honors in comparative religion from  Wesleyan University  in  Middletown ,  Connecticut , and spent two years traveling around  India . While on his way to California to reunite with the Grateful Dead in 1971, he stopped at his family's ranch; not intending to stay, he ended up changing his plans and began practicing  animal husbandry  in  Cora, Wyoming  at the Bar Cross Land and Livestock Company for almost two decades before selling the business in 1988. In the meantime, Barlow was still able to play an active role in the Grateful Dead while recruiting many unconventional part-time ranch hands from the mainstream as well as the  counterculture .  John Byrne Cooke  is currently producing "The Bar Cross Ranch" (working title), a film featuring this era.
103_9	CAR_6bc3e7b0c714b80fbaf561205127e53c6e3fce8e	Robert Hall "Bob" Weir (; born October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the  Grateful Dead . After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with  The Other Ones , later known as  The Dead , together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including  Kingfish , the Bob Weir Band,  Bobby and the Midnites , Scaring the Children,  RatDog  and  Furthur , co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist  Phil Lesh . In 2015, Weir, along with former  Grateful Dead  members  Mickey Hart  and  Bill Kreutzmann , joined with  Grammy -winning singer/guitarist  John Mayer  to form the band  Dead & Company . Weir continued to tour with  Dead & Company  in 2016.
103_9	CAR_6ccdc0ad957d2315c8ee33ed453f0e07d45e6b06	The concert was a "stealth" performance by the Grateful Dead, who were billed as "Mickey Hart and His Heartbeats" and "Bobby Ace and His Cards from the Bottom of the Deck", a reference to band members  Mickey Hart  and  Bob Weir .  The band performed one set of  acoustic music , including some rarely played tunes.  They were joined on some songs by  John Dawson  and  David Nelson  of the  New Riders of the Purple Sage .  The last six songs of the concert were performed solo by  Ron "Pigpen" McKernan , singing and playing an  acoustic guitar .

The album initiated Weir's writing partnership with his old schoolmate from  Wyoming ,  John Barlow , as lyricist.

103_9	CAR_77770e511abc205adf073d0ef94d153537beb9e2	Weir's first solo album  Ace  appeared in 1972, with the Grateful Dead performing as the band on the album, though credited individually. Included in this line-up were  Keith Godchaux  and his wife  Donna , both of whom would be in the band by the time of the album's release. A live version of the album's best-known song, "Playing in the Band", had been issued on the  Skull & Roses album  of the previous year. While continuing to perform as a member of the Grateful Dead, in 1975 and 1976 Weir played in the Bay Area band  Kingfish  with friends  Matt Kelly  and  Dave Torbert . He later contributed to Kelly's 1987 album A Wing and a Prayer, on Relix Records. In 1978 he fronted the Bob Weir Band with  Brent Mydland , who joined the Grateful Dead the following year. In 1980 he formed another side band,  Bobby and the Midnites .
103_9	CAR_8332b68766f6c6b8ba10f1f1c211f015d5e11739	Since 1995, the former members of the Grateful Dead have also pursued solo music careers.  Both  Bob Weir & RatDog  and  Phil Lesh and Friends  have performed many concerts and released several albums. Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann have also each released a few albums. Hart has toured with his  world music  percussion ensemble Planet Drum as well as the Mickey Hart Band.  Kreutzmann has led several different bands, including  BK3 ,  7 Walkers  (with  Papa Mali ), and  Billy & the Kids .  Donna Godchaux has returned to the music scene, with the  Donna Jean Godchaux Band , and  Tom Constanten  also continues to write and perform music.  All of these groups continue to play Grateful Dead music.
103_9	CAR_8824b40f2f8d780a13f8d145301d203bbd7edff4	"Black-Throated Wind" is the second track from  Grateful Dead  member  Bob Weir 's solo debut,  Ace . The song was written by Weir and lyricist  John Perry Barlow  about the experiences Barlow had on a road trip from  New York  to  San Francisco  in 1971. Barlow has said that the experience was "right out of  Easy Rider ," in that he was accosted by locals in the  American South  for having long hair.
103_9	CAR_8c3c5de801f1f8c7dce98736ad92dc0435db9223	The song was first performed on 19 October 1971 by the Grateful Dead, and first appeared on Bob Weir's  Ace  album, and The Grateful Dead's  Europe '72  live album. After that it became a regular part of the Dead's repertoire, and as might be expected, was frequently heard on Saturday shows; with its short, compact form and energetic  crescendo es, it was a popular break from some of the Dead's more challenging pieces. It has continued to be regularly performed by post-Grateful Dead collaboratives, including  The Other Ones ,  Phil Lesh & Friends ,  The Dead ,  Furthur ,  RatDog ,  Dead & Company , and various solo Weir projects.
103_9	CAR_92967f59f47704f48a539468f25b79c60c85e584	Mydland quickly became an integral part of the Dead owing to his vocal and songwriting skills as much as his keyboard playing. He quickly combined his tenor singing with founder members Weir and  Jerry Garcia  to provide strong three-part harmonies on live favourites including "I Know You Rider", "Eyes of the World" and " Truckin' ". He easily fit into the band's sound and added his own contributions, such as in  Go to Heaven  (1980) which featured two of Mydland's songs, "Far From Me" and "Easy to Love You", the latter written with frequent Weir collaborator  John Perry Barlow .  On the next album,  In the Dark  (1987), Mydland co-wrote the defiant favorite "Hell in a Bucket" with Weir and Barlow; he also penned the train song "Tons of Steel".
103_9	CAR_9389c4288f00a2a9a25bee7cad03ee94082e16ef	The Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands such as  the Beatles ,  the Beach Boys  and  the Rolling Stones  were dominating the airwaves. "The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band," said Bob Weir. "What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing."  Former folk-scene star  Bob Dylan  had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring  New York City  band  the Lovin' Spoonful  that they decided to "go electric" and look for a dirtier sound. Gradually, many of the East-Coast American folk musicians, formerly luminaries of the coffee-house scene, were moving in the electric direction.  It was natural for  Jerry Garcia  and  Bob Weir , each of whom had been immersed in the  American folk music revival  of the late 1950s and early 1960s, to be open-minded toward electric guitars.
103_9	CAR_9726a088e9269f9febca5af7e455cc85c09d6033	Their first and only album,  Missing Man Formation , was released in 1998.

In March 2012, he performed with  Bob Weir  of the  Grateful Dead  and members of The National for a  HeadCount  awareness-raising webcast performance called The Bridge Session. In 2016 Doucette served as Co-Curator and performer on  Day Of The Dead , a tribute to the Grateful Dead spearheaded by The National and released on  4AD . Doucette also appears on  Blue Mountain , a  Bob Weir  solo album conceived and created by Weir as well as musicians involved with the 2012 The Bridge Session performance.

The original intention, according to Robinson, was to "have a local L.A. band, just play in California, see where the music takes us and have a good time." They then embarked on an 118 date North American tour in 2011. Robinson names  Grateful Dead  members  Phil Lesh  and  Bob Weir , who sat in with the band during CRB's run at the  Great American Music Hall , as both musical inspirations and friends. As well as Robinson, the band features fellow Black Crowes member  Adam MacDougall ,  Ryan Adams  collaborator  Neal Casal , bassist Mark Dutton, and drummer  George Sluppick . Robinson describes the Brotherhood as a "farm-to-table psychedelic band".
103_9	CAR_9dda5869eb952af7a1243423950fe8f8fa435f61	Hunter's relationship with the band grew until he was officially a non-performing band member. When the band was inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  in 1994, Hunter was included as a band member, the only non-performer ever so honored. The majority of the Grateful Dead's original songs are Hunter/Garcia collaborations, where Garcia composed the music and Hunter wrote the lyrics. Garcia once described Hunter as "the band member who doesn't come out on stage with us." Hunter also collaborated as a lyricist with the other voices in the Dead,  Bob Weir ,  Phil Lesh , and  Ron "Pigpen" McKernan , although over time Weir, the other principal songwriter besides Garcia, switched to using  John Perry Barlow  as a lyricist.

103_9	CAR_b2f2ee5f1f19bc86b60253edb09a8cd62beb5da2	On  AllMusic ,  Stephen Thomas Erlewine  wrote, "Most of all, 30 Trips illustrates how the Dead kept circling back to their folk and blues beginnings no matter who supplemented the core quintet of Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann, and Mickey Hart. While the four or five main keyboardists brought their own signatures (particularly Pigpen, whose rough-hewn growl provided a gritty counterpart to the band's spacy early explorations), come 1971, the year after the twin masterpieces of Workingman's Dead and American Beauty, the Dead maintained a groove more psychedelic in spirit than sound.... If you take all 30 trips, the Dead's journey feels long and sweet and unlike anything else in rock."

103_9	CAR_bbe3a220f7bf407f96f20f7090a9f74632a7c528	"Dark Star" is a  song  released as a  single  by the  Grateful Dead  on  Warner Bros.  records in 1968. It was written by lyricist  Robert Hunter  and composed by lead guitarist  Jerry Garcia ; however, compositional credit is sometimes extended to include  Phil Lesh ,  Bill Kreutzmann ,  Mickey Hart ,   Ron "Pigpen" McKernan , and  Bob Weir . "Dark Star" was an early Grateful Dead classic and became one of their most loved and anticipated numbers, often with the group using it as a vehicle for musical improvisation sessions that extended beyond the original structure of the song. The song is included in  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll  list and was ranked at number 57 on  Rolling Stone's  100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. "Dark Star" was often the basis for jamming during the Dead's live shows, allowing the band to employ techniques typical of improvisational jazz.
103_9	CAR_c1fd966c16976b93577873767f118d0dddb6ff8e	"Playing in the Band" is a  Grateful Dead  song. The lyrics were written by  Robert Hunter  and  rhythm guitar ist  Bob Weir  composed the music. The song first emerged in embryonic form on the self-titled 1971  live album   Grateful Dead . It then appeared in a more polished form on  Ace , Bob Weir's first solo album (which included every  Grateful Dead  member except  Ron "Pigpen" McKernan ).
103_9	CAR_c4da22510f569cbd882ce22bf9841650b372d1ce	In  Relix ,  Jeff Tamarkin  said, "Most Deadheads, regardless of when they came on board, have a favorite era or specific year, and for many, 1977 is high on the list. Refreshed from a year-plus-long hiatus, and with drummer  Mickey Hart  now back in the band after his own extended layoff, the Grateful Dead was tight and rejuvenated. This May show from Virginia is a slow-builder, picking up steam midway through the first set with  Bob Weir's  " Cassidy " and  Jerry Garcia's  "Loser" and never looking back. The band interplay in the "Lazy Lightning" > "Supplication" jam that follows is where the album kicks into high gear, but it’s the second set that's the keeper... As quintessentially delicious as the playing is in Richmond, the true highlights are Garcia and Weir’s vocal performances; both were singing with a newly discovered care for nuance that served the music supremely well. Judging by this first release in David Lemieux’s new series, Dave's Picks will be a worthy successor to the vaunted Dick's Picks series."

103_9	CAR_d20a5bf2712da8143454e2617246c6a9b9392cfd	"Mexicali Blues" was written by Bob Weir and lyricist  John Perry Barlow . This was the first songwriting collaboration for Weir and Barlow. Barlow has noted that Weir had an idea for a " cowboy  song" and asked Barlow to write the lyrics after  Robert Hunter  declined.  Weir would soon switch to using Barlow rather than Hunter for the bulk of his songwriting.
103_9	CAR_d27a87e01743cb7ebb459a7250732e4fcad710dc	Its origins come from an offer by the Dead's  Warner Bros. Records  label to have band members cut their own solo records, and it came out the same year as  Jerry Garcia 's  Garcia  and  Mickey Hart 's  Rolling Thunder . However, in the case of Ace, Weir's backing band was the Dead itself (minus  Ron "Pigpen" McKernan ), and all songs except "Walk in the Sunshine" became concert staples of the Dead.

Barlow, who had been part of the  LSD  (also known as "acid") counterculture in the 1960s and founded the  Electronic Frontier Foundation , wrote a manifesto called  A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace . Addressed to politicians, it declared "the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose upon us". Two computer hackers— Phiber Optik  and  Acid Phreak —knew that in reality corporations were using the internet to exert more control over the lives of people than governments had done in the past, and they demonstrated that hierarchies did exist online by obtaining Barlow's  credit record  from  TRW Inc.  and posting it on the internet.

Though Grateful Dead vocalist  Bob Weir  sang lead on the song when it was played by the band, lead singer  Jerry Garcia  had played the song as early as 1972 with  Merl Saunders  and  John Kahn , both of whom would become members of the  Jerry Garcia Band .
103_9	CAR_e74a3e302108e361f37189b43e909d22fe01d365	Barlow has also returned to writing lyrics, most recently with  The String Cheese Incident 's mandolinist and vocalist  Michael Kang , including their song "Desert Dawn." Barlow has been seen many times with  Carolyn Garcia  (whose monologue is dubbed on the eponymous track "Mountain Girl") at their concerts mixing with the fans and members in the band, and is a close friend of String Cheese Incident producer  Jerry Harrison . He also participated with the  Chicago -based  jam band   Mr. Blotto  on their release Barlow Shanghai. Barlow is a Spiritual Mentor/Student of  Kemp Muhl  and  Sean Lennon , collaborating with their band  The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger  and making a cameo in their 2014 music video "Animals."

103_9	CAR_ed811eea6688422562135c2425a1a77986da14be	Weir was born in  San Francisco, California  to John (Jack) Parber and a fellow college student who later gave him up, and was raised by his adoptive parents, Frederic Utter and Eleanor Cramer Weir, in the suburb of  Atherton .  He began playing  guitar  at age thirteen after less successful experimentation with the  piano  and the  trumpet . He had trouble in school because of undiagnosed  dyslexia  and he was expelled from nearly every school he attended, including  Menlo-Atherton High School  in Atherton,  California  and  Fountain Valley School  in Colorado,. where he met future Grateful Dead lyricist  John Perry Barlow .
103_9	CAR_f10a760a8cd1c4227a9b63ef80ac074c6bcfb0d3	The seeds of the Barlow–Weir collaboration were sown at a Grateful Dead show at the Capitol Theater in  Port Chester, New York , in February 1971. Until then, Weir had mostly worked with resident Dead lyricist  Robert Hunter . Hunter preferred that those who sang his songs stick to his "canonical" lyrics rather than improvising additions or rearranging words. A feud erupted backstage over a couplet in "Sugar Magnolia" from the band's most recent release (most likely "She can dance a Cajun rhythm/Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive"), culminating in a disgruntled Hunter summoning Barlow and telling him "take him (Weir)—he's yours". In the fall of 1971, with a deal for a solo album in hand and only two songs completed, Weir and Barlow began to write together for the first time.

"I wrote it the way I thought he would've," Weir said following the performance when an audience member asked him about the song. Rolling Stone also reported that "Ki-Yi Bossie," will be a campfire singalong with  Ramblin' Jack Elliott ." Talking about "Lay My Lily Down", Mason prompted Weir on the content of the record, noting the song contained quite a bit of sadness. "Because I've been there," Weir responded when asked how he transported himself to that mood. The emotional reading of the next song came from, according to Weir, listening to a lot of Appalachian music.
103_9	CAR_f4b06c5dd892af690db67ba5dc6c2ccc87eb48dc	This was the third live multi-disk album in the Dead's past five releases, revealing how the group's reputation rested on their live performances. The album contained considerable new material in addition to versions of tracks found on previous studio albums. Lead guitarist  Jerry Garcia  continued his longtime collaboration with  Robert Hunter , while rhythm guitarist  Bob Weir  had begun writing material with  John Perry Barlow . Many of the new songs were not officially released in studio form, though they did appear on solo albums; consequently Europe '72 was treated as a new release rather than a live retrospective.

The nine live albums were recently recorded and mostly contained previously unreleased original material.  They filled the role of traditional studio albums, and were an integral part of the contemporaneous evolution of the band.  (The Dead's second album, Anthem of the Sun, was an experimental amalgam of studio and live material.)
103_10	CAR_31587ac8c2b17b7395a70f3158484f09d8aedab0	During the summer of 1995 shortly after the now famous Deer Creek gate crash, Grateful Dead guitarist and frontman  Jerry Garcia  died, ending the group's thirty years of prominence. The surviving members created a band called  The Other Ones  (they used the name " The Dead " for some tours in the following decade). During the same period, Phish rose to prominence, and bands such as String Cheese Incident and Blues Traveler became successful. Many stranded Deadheads moved over to Phish scene, which was at the time the top touring Jam band behind the Grateful Dead. Phish began a new chapter in their career after the demise of the Grateful Dead, as the band became more popular, and more recognized as mainstream, over the next five years.

Their hiatus was short-lived, though, as they resumed touring in June 1976. That same year, they re-signed with Arista Records. Their new contract soon produced  Terrapin Station  in 1977. Although things appeared to be going well for the band, problems were arising with their two newest members, Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux. The two were frequently fighting, and Keith's heroin addiction was affecting his playing. Both of these issues were causing complications with touring, and they agreed to leave the band in February 1979.

However, band members continued to perform over the subsequent years in other bands such as  RatDog ,  Phil Lesh & Friends , the  Rhythm Devils ,  the Other Ones , and  the Dead . After a four-year hiatus following their "Wave That Flag" summer tour in 2004, the Dead performed two 2008 shows supporting the  Obama campaign , billed as " Deadheads for Obama " and "Change Rocks", as well at one of the Obama inaugural balls in 2009, ultimately giving rise to a 2009 spring tour. During this reunion, Weir and Lesh, who admitted having great fun playing together again, decided to form a new band. In August 2009, the musicians announced that they had formed a new band, Furthur, with Kadlecik, Chimenti, Lane, and Russo.

Initially all their shows were in California, principally in the  San Francisco Bay Area  and in or near  Los Angeles . They also performed, in 1965 and 1966, with  Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters , as the house band for the  Acid Tests .  They toured nationally starting in June 1967 (their first foray to New York), with a few detours to  Canada ,  Europe  and three nights at the  Great Pyramid of Giza  in  Egypt  in 1978. They appeared at the  Monterey Pop Festival  in 1967, the  Woodstock Festival  in 1969 and the  Festival Express  train tour across Canada in 1970.  They were scheduled to appear as the final act at the infamous  Altamont Free Concert  on December 6, 1969 after the  Rolling Stones  but withdrew after security concerns. "That's the way things went at Altamont—so badly that the Grateful Dead, prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn't even get to play," staff at  Rolling Stone  magazine wrote in a detailed narrative on the event"

Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to unstable health and/or Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.
103_10	CAR_7aa8a7372a1f62a5375e6c89e8ab6a5163ed5619	In the early 1990s, the Grateful Dead had been working on new songs. When  Jerry Garcia  had died in 1995, the band decided to break up and this album never was able to be finished. Work on the unfinished album began in November 1994 in West Marin County in California, at a studio the band called "the Site", which was located on a hill with scenic views and occasional views of wildlife. At the time, Jerry Garcia was not particularly interested or focused upon the project, which discouraged its impetus. The studio session work did not have any lead vocals from songs that Garcia performed lead vocals on, and Garcia's guitar work on the tracks was described as "rudimentary." The tracks for the new album were incomplete.

As part of their "Fare Thee Well" celebration to honor the 50th anniversary of the Grateful Dead, the surviving members reformed (although not branded as "The Dead") to play 5 shows, which were also to be the final shows that they would play together as a group. They enlisted the help from Phish frontman Trey Anastasio on lead guitar and vocals, Bruce Hornsby on piano and vocals, and Jeff Chimenti on keyboards. There were two shows to kick off the  "Fare Thee Well"  run at Levi's Stadium- just miles from where the Grateful Dead began as a band 50 years earlier.

They had many musical influences, and their music evolved to a great degree over time.  They made extensive use of  improvisation , and are considered one of the originators of  jam band  music.  The founding members were  Jerry Garcia  on  guitar  and  vocals ,  Bob Weir  on guitar and vocals,  Phil Lesh  on  bass  and vocals,  Bill Kreutzmann  on  drums , and  Ron "Pigpen" McKernan  on  organ ,  harmonica ,  percussion , and vocals.  Pigpen died in 1973, but the other four remained with the band for its entire 30-year history.  Second drummer  Mickey Hart  was also in the band for most of that time.  Others who were band members at different times were  keyboardists   Tom Constanten ,  Keith Godchaux ,  Brent Mydland , and  Vince Welnick , and vocalist  Donna Jean Godchaux .

In February 2015, while Mayer was guest hosting the  The Late Late Show , he invited Grateful Dead guitar player  Bob Weir  to join him in a studio performance.  A bond developed between the two, and while Weir and the other three surviving core members of the Grateful Dead were preparing for their 50th anniversary shows, dubbed  Fare Thee Well , Mayer began practicing the band's large catalog of songs.  That August, Mayer and original Grateful Dead members Weir, Hart, and Kreutzmann formed the band, along with keyboardist Jeff Chimenti and bassist Oteil Burbridge. Mayer expressed a particularly strong enthusiasm toward playing with the new band.
103_10	CAR_d53f5ce3600f80139012e4385163365876f53bd8	Since the initial announcement of these three (and later five) concerts, there has been much debate among fans as to the name of the band playing these concerts. Most media outlets, including  Rolling Stone , and Ticketmaster have referred to these concerts as being performed by the Grateful Dead. However, the event's website and band member Bob Weir have only referred to the event as "Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead" (this is also the name printed on the tickets). This means that the band technically had no name, although it could be considered another version of The Dead, which is the name Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann and Hart had sporadically performed with since the Grateful Dead's 1995 disbandment.  The band has also been called simply "Fare Thee Well", e.g. on  The Grateful Dead Channel  and music trading site  etree .

Task elements typically may include a goal, a set of information cues, an action and an outcome (or product).The interaction model of web browsing works well for the web’s original purpose of information search and retrieval. Though the purpose of the web has been extended beyond information search and retrieval into hypermedia-based task executions, the original web interaction model has not been enhanced for native web tasking support.

They construct and then characterize the performance of classifiers that predict whether an escalation will occur in issued queries following the visit to a page. Their findings show that features such as serious illness preceding benign explanations in page (e.g., cancer is mentioned before caffeine in pages pertaining to headaches), serious illness vs. benign explanation appears in page title or near beginning of page, page from Web forum, and page has external verification are all important predictors of subsequent escalation (or non-escalation).
104_1	CAR_25c79fc28271daa421cfc26a4814ac0346adf3f3	The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article  As We May Think  by  Vannevar Bush  in 1945. It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a 'statistical machine' - filed by  Emanuel Goldberg  in the 1920s and '30s - that searched for documents stored on film. The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948, detailing an early mention of the  Univac  computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy,  Desk Set . In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by  Gerard Salton  at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small  text corpora  such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents). Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.

Bates argues that "berrypicking" better reflects how users search for information than previous models of information retrieval.  This may be because previous models were strictly linear and did not incorporate cognitive questions.  For instance, one typical model is of a simple linear match between a query and a document.  However, Bates points out that there are simple modifications that can be made to this process.  For instance, Salton has argued that user feedback may help improve the search results.

The use of classification schemes to arrange the documents in order was only a partial solution. Another approach was to index the contents of the documents using words or terms, rather than classification codes. In the 1940s and 1950s some pioneers, such as  Calvin Mooers , Charles L. Bernier, Evan J. Crane and  Hans Peter Luhn , collected up their index terms in various kinds of list that they called a “thesaurus” (by analogy with the well known thesaurus developed by  Peter Roget ). The first such list put seriously to use in information retrieval was the thesaurus developed in 1959 at the E I Dupont de Nemours Company.

Bruce Croft has made major contributions to most areas of information retrieval, including pioneering work in clustering, passage retrieval, sentence retrieval, and distributed search. One of the most important areas of work for Croft  relates to ranking functions and retrieval models, where he has led the development of one of the major approaches to modeling search: language modelling. In later years, Croft also led the way in the development of feature-based ranking functions. Croft and his research group have also developed a series of search engines: InQuery, the Lemur toolkit, Indri, and Galago. These search engines are open source and offer unique capabilities that are not replicated in other research retrieval platforms source – consequently they are downloaded by hundreds of researchers world wide. As a consequence of his work, Croft is one of the most cited researchers in information retrieval.

In this model, both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts, and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector.  In this paper, he also introduced  TF-IDF , or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency, a model in which the score of a term in a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs. (The concept of inverse document frequency, a measure of specificity, had been introduced in 1972 by  Karen Sparck-Jones .) Later in life, he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis, as well as automatic hypertext generation.  He published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life.

104_1	CAR_841c14700de07980a6c7dfc89d3960de8026e468	Another way to look at the data is to think about Mutual Information, which is a measure of independence between the two variables. Full independence is reached when I(D;T) = 0. Chi and Mytkowicz research on delicious social tagging data show that as a measure of usefulness of the tags and their encoding, there is a worsening trend in the ability of users to specify and find tags and documents when they are engaged in simple fact retrieval. This suggests that we need to build search and recommendation systems that help users sift through resources in social tagging systems, especially when we are engaged in more than simple fact retrieval as characterized by the information theory. In fact, although the number of documents associated with any given tag is increasing, there are many ways contextual information can help users to look for relevant information. This is in fact one of the major weakness of the simple information theory in explaining usefulness of tags – it ignores the fact that humans can extract meanings from a set of tags assigned to a document, and this semantic extraction process is exactly the reason why humans are able to communicate efficiently even though the size of our vocabulary is increasing ever since language was developed. For example, the work by Cattuto et al. (2007), published in PNAS, show that while the number of tags are increasing, the general growth pattern is scale-free – the general distribution of tag-tag co-occurrences follows a power-law. Cattuto also finds that the characteristics of this scale-free distribution are dependent on the semantics of the tag – tags that are semantically general (e.g., blogs) tend to co-occur with many tags, while semantically narrow tags (e.g., Ajax) tend to co-occur with few number of tags across a wide set of documents in a social tagging system. What this means is that the assumption of the information theory approach is too simple – when the semantics of the set of tags assigned to documents are taken into account, the predictive value of tags on contents of documents are relatively stable. This finding is important for development of  recommender system s – discovering these higher level semantic patterns is important in helping people to find relevant information (also see semantic imitation model below).

A key area of research in HCIR involves evaluation of these systems. Early work on interactive information retrieval, such as Juergen Koenemann and  Nicholas J. Belkin 's 1996 study of different levels of interaction for automatic query reformulation, leverage the standard IR measures of  precision  and  recall  but apply them to the results of multiple iterations of user interaction, rather than to a single query response. Other HCIR research, such as Pia Borlund's IIR evaluation model, applies a methodology more reminiscent of HCI, focusing on the characteristics of users, the details of experimental design, etc.

He saw the potential in information retrieval systems, ultimately changing the future of research.  With the new IBM technology, and Lockheed’s general practice of ‘redoing research’ rather than wasting time, Summit had convinced Lockheed to support him in furthering research of information retrieval.  One important criteria was that computer programmers would not be needed to conduct searches.  The system would be interactive to allow searches and queries to be modified easily (also known as  recursion ), and that it would provide alphabetical displays of all the items one could choose from (also known as indexing) (Summit, 2002).

This conundrum of  natural language processing  (NLP) and  information retrieval  (IR) on the web – and data bases in general – can be addressed using the mathematical formalism of quantum theory. As basic steps, (a) the seminal book "The Geometry of Information Retrieval" by K. Van Rijsbergen introduced a quantum structure approach to IR, (b) Widdows and Peters utilised a quantum logical negation for a concrete search system, and Aerts and Czachor identified quantum structure in semantic space theories, such as  latent semantic analysis . Since then, the employment of techniques and procedures induced from the mathematical formalisms of quantum theory – Hilbert space, quantum logic and probability, non-commutative algebras, etc. – in fields such as IR and NLP, has produced significant results.

A skill is automatic when there is one step from stimulus to retrieval. For many problem solving tasks, reaction time is related to how long it takes to discover an answer, but as time goes on, certain answers are stored within the individual's memory and they have to simply recall the information, thus reducing reaction time. This is the first theory that addresses the why of the power law of practice.

In  Cranfield -style evaluations, this typically involves assigning a relevance level to each retrieved result, a process known as relevance assessment. Relevance levels can be binary (indicating a result is relevant or that it is not relevant), or graded (indicating results have a varying degree of match between the topic of the result and the information need).   Once relevance levels have been assigned to the retrieved results,  information retrieval performance measures  can be used to assess the quality of a retrieval system's output.

Through a query expansion, some relevant documents missed in the initial round can then be retrieved to improve the overall performance. Clearly, the effect of this method strongly relies on the quality of selected expansion terms. It has been found to improve performance in the TREC ad hoc task . But it is not without the dangers of an automatic process. For example, if the query is about copper mines and the top several documents are all about mines in Chile, then there may be query drift in the direction of documents on Chile. In addition, if the words added to the original query are unrelated to the query topic, the quality of the retrieval is likely to be degraded, especially in Web search, where web documents often cover multiple different topics. To improve the quality of expansion words in pseudo-relevance feedback, a positional relevance feedback for pseudo-relevance feedback has been proposed to select from feedback documents those words that are focused on the query topic based on positions of words in feedback documents. Specifically, the positional relevance model assigns more weights to words occurring closer to query words based on the intuition that words closer to query words are more likely to be related to the query topic.

Plaintiff Laura Zubulake filed suit against her former employer  UBS , alleging gender  discrimination , failure to promote, and  retaliation .  Judge Shira Scheindlin's rulings comprise some of the most often cited in the area of  electronic discovery , and were made prior to the 2006 amendments to the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . The relevant opinions in the field are known as  Zubulake I , Zubulake III, Zubulake IV, and Zubulake V.   In 2012, the plaintiff published a book about her e-discovery experiences titled Zubulake's e-Discovery: The Untold Story of my Quest for Justice.
104_9	CAR_44ce78363de24abcf2536987ada6ac8e3a680165	In litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems. Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.

104_9	CAR_c29c94dd476388eba9becce0b0c752461b2b52bf	Under the  law of the United States , civil discovery is wide-ranging and can involve any material which is "reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence."  This is a much broader standard than relevance, because it contemplates the exploration of evidence which might be relevant, rather than evidence which is truly relevant.  (Issues of the scope of relevance are taken care of before trial in motions in  limine  and during trial with objections.) Certain types of information are generally protected from discovery; these include information which is  privileged  and the  work product  of the opposing party. Other types of information may be protected, depending on the type of case and the status of the party.  For instance, juvenile criminal records are generally not discoverable, peer review findings by hospitals in medical negligence cases are  generally not discoverable and, depending on the case, other types of evidence may be non-discoverable for reasons of privacy, difficulty and/or expense in complying and for other reasons. (Criminal discovery rules may differ from those discussed here.)  Electronic discovery  or "e-discovery" refers to discovery of information stored in  electronic format  (often referred to as  Electronically Stored Information , or ESI).

The original file format is known as the  "native" format . Litigators may review material from e-discovery in one of several formats: printed paper, "native file", or a petrified, paper-like format, such as PDF files or TIFF images.  Modern document review platforms accommodate the use of native files, and allow for them to be converted to TIFF and  Bates -stamped for use in court.
104_9	CAR_d90a6db018cc1e7d84c81c2de325cb03e32cb890	Recent amendments to the United States  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  (FRCP) address the  discovery  of electronically stored information (ESI) (aka  e-discovery ), expanding the use of a "legal hold" beyond preservation of paper documents. The amendments were written in anticipation of legal arguments and  tactic s related to the production of ESI, such as the  cost  and difficulty of producing such ESI and claims that such ESI was missing, deleted, or otherwise inaccessible when it really wasn’t the case. These changes took effect December 1, 2006 and require organizations to hold all electronic records until each legal matter is formally settled, even if an organization only reasonably anticipates litigation.

104_10	CAR_caadc5b1d3560cab0db70c6ffa486540cb97fd59	Precision and recall have been two of the traditional performance measures for evaluating information retrieval systems.  Precision is the fraction of the retrieved result documents that are relevant to the user's information need.  Recall is defined as the fraction of relevant documents in the entire collection that are returned as result documents.
104_10	CAR_cef18912f5c9b7c722a3cf83451a2222f7520afa	The evaluation of an information retrieval system is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users. Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for  Boolean retrieval  or top-k retrieval, include  precision and recall .  Many more measures for evaluating the performance of information retrieval systems have also been proposed. In general, measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query. All common measures described here assume a  ground truth  notion of relevancy: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice, queries may be  ill-posed  and there may be different shades of relevancy.
104_10	CAR_f041a09c412533d214cc4756f05f05ed28f356c9	In order to evaluate how well an  information retrieval  system retrieved topically relevant results, the relevance of retrieved results must be quantified. In  Cranfield -style evaluations, this typically involves assigning a relevance level to each retrieved result, a process known as relevance assessment. Relevance levels can be binary (indicating a result is relevant or that it is not relevant), or graded (indicating results have a varying degree of match between the topic of the result and the information need).   Once relevance levels have been assigned to the retrieved results,  information retrieval performance measures  can be used to assess the quality of a retrieval system's output.
104_10	MARCO_5245403	An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines.In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection.Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy. An object is an entity that is represented by information in a database.earches can be based on metadata or on full-text (or other content-based) indexing. Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called  information overload . Many universities and public libraries use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents.
104_12	CAR_34043b1aca4f276b3dc12a149f0e2516e4777680	Some measures of performance indicate how well search algorithms do at  optimization  of the objective function. Indeed, there seems to be no interesting application of search algorithms in the class under consideration but to optimization problems. A common performance measure is the least index of the least value in the output sequence. This is the number of evaluations required to minimize the objective function. For some algorithms, the time required to find the minimum is proportional to the number of evaluations.

In  information retrieval , it is often used to measure effectiveness of  web   search engine   algorithm s or related applications. Using a  graded relevance  scale of documents in a search engine result set, DCG measures the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The gain is accumulated from the top of the result list to the bottom with the gain of each result discounted at lower ranks.
104_12	CAR_7890b9ad1d0e13632dce22892f18049ae948ac76	The Rocchio algorithm is based on a method of  relevance feedback  found in  information retrieval  systems which stemmed from the  SMART Information Retrieval System  around the year 1970. Like many other retrieval systems, the Rocchio feedback approach was developed using the  Vector Space Model .  The  algorithm  is based on the assumption that most users have a general conception of which documents should be denoted as   relevant  or non-relevant.  Therefore, the user's search query is revised to include an arbitrary percentage of  relevant and non-relevant documents as a means of increasing the  search engine 's  recall , and possibly the precision as well.  The number of  relevant and non-relevant documents allowed to enter a  query  is dictated by the weights of the a, b, c variables listed below in the  Algorithm section .

It was the Cranfield experiments, which introduced the famous measures  “recall” and “precision”  as evaluation criteria for systems efficiency. The Cranfield experiments found that classification systems like UDC and facet-analytic systems were less efficient compared to free-text searches or low level indexing systems (“UNITERM”). The Cranfield I test found according to Ellis (1996, 3-6) the following results.

Precision measures the proportion of search results that are relevant to the query. Recall measures the proportion of the total number of relevant items that were returned by the search results. Where a standardised test set has been used, measures such as precision and recall can be used to directly compare the search performance of different speech analytics systems.

This approach is supported by results from Simon (1955), who concludes that people start their decision making process by gathering relevant information. Publicly available data on search volumes for most Internet search services starts from the year 2004. Since that time many authors showed the usefulness of such data in predicting investor attention and market returns (Da et al. (2014), Preis et al. (2013), and Curme et al. (2014)). Most studies are using  Google Trends  (GT) service in order to extract search volume data and investigate investor attention. The usefulness of Internet search data was also proved based on  Yahoo! Corporation  data (Bordino et al. (2012)). The application of Internet search data gives promising results in solving different financial problems. The authors in Kristoufek (2013b) discuss the application of GT data in  portfolio diversification  problem. Proposed in the paper diversification procedure is based on the assumption that the popularity of a particular stock in Internet queries is correlated with the riskiness of this stock. The author reports that such diversification procedure helps significantly improve portfolio returns. Da et al. (2014) and Dimpfl & Jank (2015) investigate a predictive power of GT data for two most popular volatility measures:  realized volatility  (RV) and  CBOE  daily market volatility index ( VIX ). Both studies report positive and significant dependence between Internet search data and volatility measures. Bordino et al. (2012) and Preis et al. (2010) reveal the ability of Internet search data to predict trading volumes in the US stock markets. According to Bordino et al. (2012), "...query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more." Some researchers find the usefulness of GT data in predicting volatility on  foreign currency market  (Smith (2012)). An increasingly important role of Internet search data is admitted in  cryptocurrency  (e.g  BitCoin ) prices forecasting (Kristoufek (2013a)). Google Trends data is also reported to be a good predictor for daily  mutual fund  flows. Da et al. (2014) concludes that such type of sentiment data "...has significant incremental predictive power for future daily fund flow innovations of both equity and bond funds." One more promising source of Internet search data is the amount of visits of finance-related Wikipedia pages (Wikipedia page statistics) (Moat et al. (2013) and Kristoufek (2013a)). To sum up, the Internet search behavior of households is relatively new and promising proxy for investor attention. Such type of sentiment data does not require additional information from other sources and can be used in scientific studies independently.

These efforts have included looking at Google patents. According to these patents, sitelinks are derived from user behavior, in particular, the number of times a page has been accessed, the amount of time spent on the page, and from the content of the page itself—whether the page contains commercial transactions, etc. In an alternative embodiment, it is suggested that web-site providers might provide the search engine system with a list of favoured web-pages within their own web-site.

104_13	CAR_bb799138afa066363e0c59e6a1ef497700ff5466	Social media optimization is becoming an increasingly important factor in  search engine optimization , which is the process of designing a website in a way so that it has as high a ranking as possible on  search engine s. As search engines are increasingly utilizing the recommendations of users of social networks such as  Reddit ,  Facebook ,  Tumblr ,  Twitter ,  YouTube ,  LinkedIn ,  Pinterest ,  Instagram  and  Google+  to rank pages in the  search engine result page s. The implication is that when a webpage is shared or "liked" by a user on a social network, it counts as a "vote" for that webpage's quality. Thus, search engines can use such votes accordingly to properly ranked websites in search engine results pages. Furthermore, since it is more difficult to top the scales or influence the search engines in this way, search engines are putting more stock into social search.  This, coupled with increasingly  personalized search  based on interests and location, has significantly increased the importance of a social media presence in search engine optimization.  Due to personalized search results, location-based social media presences on websites such as  Yelp ,  Google Places ,  Foursquare , and  Yahoo! Local  have become increasingly important. While social media optimization is related to  search engine marketing , it differs in several ways.  Primarily, SMO focuses on driving web traffic from sources other than search engines, though improved search engine ranking is also a benefit of successful social media optimization. Further, SMO is helpful to target particular geographic regions in order to target and reach  potential customers. This helps in lead generation (finding new customers) and contributes to high conversion rates (i.e., converting previously uninterested individuals into people who are interested in a brand or organization).

Ads with poor click through rates can be pushed down to the bottom of the first page of search results or onto subsequent pages. Even though advertisers are only paying for click throughs, the algorithms assigning ad positions based on ad popularity provide incentives for optimizing keyword selection and other cost control measures. Without cost control measures, it is possible for ad buyers to spend twenty five to fifty percent of their ad budget ineffectively.

Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans:  Michael Brown , resulting in  protests and unrest in Ferguson , and  Eric Garner  in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the  2016 United States presidential election . The originators of the hashtag and call to action,  Alicia Garza ,  Patrisse Cullors , and  Opal Tometi , expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.

Garza is credited with inspiring the slogan when, after the July 2013 acquittal of  George Zimmerman , she posted on Facebook: "Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter, Black Lives Matter" which Cullors then shared with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. Garza's organization Black Lives Matter was spurred on by the deaths of black people by police in recent media and racial disparities within the U.S. criminal justice system. She was also struck by the similarities of  Trayvon Martin  to her younger brother, feeling that it could have been him killed instead. Garza led the 2015  Freedom Ride  to Ferguson, organized by Cullors and  Darnell Moore  that launched the building of BlackLivesMatter chapters across the United States. Garza self-identifies as a  queer  woman, and her spouse is biracial and transgender; Garza draws on all of these experiences in her organizing and activism.

105_2	CAR_0a52a4ff78c9ac99b7050c0e57b409b4112a2575	The #SayHerName movement arose as a response to both the media's and the  Black Lives Matter  movement's tendencies to sideline the experiences of black women in the context of police brutality and anti-Black violence. For example, police killings of black men as  Trayvon Martin  and  Michael Brown  have tended to garner a much higher degree of public outcry than the killings of black women such as  Rekia Boyd  and Shelly Frey.
105_2	CAR_0d223bc34866b78fe46d8cfef4bc010fc6fc8f19	In July 2013, the Attorney General  Eric Holder  gave a speech when he mentioned that as a black man the need to deliver "the Talk" to his children, namely he would have to inform his children that some, mostly white people who were going to hate them not because what they did, but simply because of their skin color. In response to Holder's speech, Hanson wrote a column titled "Facing Facts about Race" where he offered up his own version (and others’) of "the Talk", namely the need to inform his children to be careful of young black men when venturing into the inner city, who Hanson argued were statistically more likely to commit violent crimes than young men of other races, and that therefore it was understandable for the police to focus on groups with the highest statistical crime rates, which turn  out to be young black males. Hanson wrote his father once had been robbed by young black men, and had given him "the Talk" warning his son to exercise caution in known crime-ridden areas and to note that African-American male youth have a far higher incidence of assault than other groups; and Hanson added that having been robbed himself by black men, he had given "the Talk" warning his children to avoid situations when in dangerous areas and to exercise caution there when encountering groups of young African-American men when alone, whom Hanson argue were statistically more likely to have had criminal records. Hanson therefore criticized Holder and Obama for suggesting that racism may had been a factor in the trial of Hispanic  George Zimmerman  who had been charged and acquitted of murder with the shooting death of  Trayvon Martin —and especially for intruding in an ongoing criminal case before a jury had even been selected. Hanson argued that Zimmerman was later found by a jury of his peers to be justified in shooting Martin in self-defense, and he suggested that Obama was alluding to racism being a factor in the case, to distract attention from his then unpopular presidency. Referring to the concurrent case at the time of two Vietnamese-Americans killed by a black convicted felon, Hanson wrote: "The world will long remember Trayvon Martin, but few people — and certainly not Barack Obama or Eric Holder, who have a bad habit, in an increasingly multiracial country, of claiming solidarity on the basis of race — will care that Khin Min and Lina Lim were torn to pieces by bullets and a knife. Few will care that they died in a vicious assault that had nothing to do with stereotyping, Stand Your Ground self-defense, weak gun laws, insufficient federal civil-rights legislation, or any of the other causes of interracial violence falsely advanced by the attorney general — but quite a lot to do with an urban culture that for unspoken reasons has spawned an epidemic of disproportionate violent crime on the part of young African-American males."

Zimmerman's neighbors had nothing derogatory to say about him, and his co-workers were complimentary. CNN headlined its article on the FBI interviews "Witnesses tell FBI that George Zimmerman is no racist".

Rivera was quoted saying, "I am urging the parents of black and Latino youngsters particularly to not let their children go out wearing hoodies." Faced with outrage over his statements, Rivera apologized, saying that he had "obscured the main point that someone shot and killed an unarmed teenager".When a 7-Eleven surveillance video showing Martin making a purchase on the night of the shooting was released two months later, however, Rivera referred to the clothes he had been wearing as "thug wear". His comments were criticized by the Martin family attorney, Benjamin Crump, who compared them to people blaming rape victims for wearing short skirts.
105_2	CAR_2b197f6f5f324bdcf294e8723d6eaaf6666b5b9f	In 2013, the movement began with the use of the  hashtag  #BlackLivesMatter on  social media , after  the acquittal  of  George Zimmerman  in  the shooting death  of African-American teen  Trayvon Martin . Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans:  Michael Brown , resulting in  protests and unrest in Ferguson , and  Eric Garner  in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the  2016 United States presidential election . The originators of the hashtag and call to action,  Alicia Garza ,  Patrisse Cullors , and  Opal Tometi , expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.

The Chief of Police in Sanford announced after his review of the evidence there would be no arrest. An outcry from all over this country came because his parents refused to leave it there." Jesse Jackson also referred to Martin as "murdered and martyred". And U.S. Rep.  Frederica Wilson  (Dem.), who represents Martin's hometown of Miami, used the word "murdered" when she referred to Martin's fatal shooting.

Roof reportedly told friends and neighbors of his plans to kill people, including a plot to attack the  College of Charleston , but his claims were not taken seriously. On June 20, a website was discovered called The Last Rhodesian (www.lastrhodesian.com); it had been registered to a "Dylann Roof" on February 9, 2015. The website included what appeared to be an unsigned manifesto containing Roof's opinions of "Blacks", "Jews", "Hispanics" and "East Asians", as well a cache of photos, including an image of Roof posing with a handgun and a  Confederate Battle Flag . In this manifesto, Roof says he became "racially aware" as a result of the 2012  shooting of Trayvon Martin , writing that because he kept hearing people talk about the incident, he "decided to look him up" and read the  Wikipedia  article about it. He concluded that  George Zimmerman  had been in the right, and he was unable to comprehend why the case had gained national attention. He then searched for "black on White  crime" on  Google  and found the website of the  Council of Conservative Citizens , where he read "pages upon pages" of cases involving black people murdering white people. Roof then writes he has "never been the same since that day".
105_2	CAR_37019c6d6c8e2bd982e14b18cf9ccd9c9bd2b8aa	Following Martin's death, rallies, marches and protests were held across the nation. In March 2012, hundreds of students at his high school held a walkout in support of him. An online petition calling for a full investigation and prosecution of Zimmerman garnered 2.2 million signatures. Also in March, the media coverage surrounding Martin's death became the first story of 2012 to be featured more than the  presidential race , which was underway at the time. A national debate about racial profiling and stand your ground laws ensued, and the governor of Florida appointed a task force to examine the state's self-defense laws. Martin's life was scrutinized by the media and bloggers who examined the  digital footprint  he had left behind. On  social media , the name "Trayvon" was tweeted (mentioned in posts to  Twitter   web feed s by users of the service) more than two million times in the 30 days following the shooting. More than 1,000 people attended the viewing of his remains the day before his funeral, which was held on March 3, 2012 in  Miami, Florida . He was buried in Dade-Memorial Park (North), in Miami. A memorial was dedicated to Martin at the Goldsboro Westside Historical Museum, a black history museum in Sanford in July 2013.
105_2	CAR_3ef9de7c4ca77fa3cd5eac57bb5ffccc8f7c716c	Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a "postracial America." However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as "racial venom" directed at Obama's presidency. In July 2009, prominent African-American  Harvard  professor  Henry Louis Gates, Jr. , was arrested at his  Cambridge, Massachusetts  home by a local police officer, sparking a  controversy  after Obama stated that the police acted "stupidly" in handling the incident. To reduce tensions, Obama invited Gates and police officer to the White House in what became known as the "Beer Summit". Several other incidents during Obama's presidency sparked outrage in the  African-American  community and/or the law enforcement community, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists. The  acquittal  of  George Zimmerman  following the  shooting of Trayvon Martin  sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he noted that "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago." The shooting of  Michael Brown  in  Ferguson, Missouri   sparked a wave of protests . These and other events led to the birth of the  Black Lives Matter  movement, which campaigns against violence and  systemic racism  toward  black people . Some in the law enforcement community criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police. Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups. In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried "a great deal" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.

Martin, who was serving a school suspension, had gone with his father on a visit to his father's fiancée at her  townhouse  at  The Retreat at Twin Lakes  in Sanford. On the evening of February 26, Martin went to a convenience store and purchased candy and a canned drink. As Martin returned from the store, he walked through a neighborhood that had been victimized by robberies several times that year. Zimmerman, a member of the community watch, spotted him and called the Sanford Police to report him for suspicious behavior. Moments later, there was an altercation between the two individuals in which Zimmerman shot Martin in the chest. Zimmerman, who was injured in the altercation, was not charged at the time of the shooting by the Sanford Police, who said that there was no evidence to refute his claim of self-defense and that Florida's  stand your ground law  prohibited law-enforcement officials from arresting or charging him. After national media focused on the tragedy, Zimmerman was eventually charged and tried in Martin's death.  A jury acquitted Zimmerman  of second-degree murder and manslaughter in July 2013.

Zimmerman was the  neighborhood watch  coordinator for the gated community where Martin was temporarily staying and where the shooting took place. The Twin Lakes Neighborhood Watch program was not registered with the  National Neighborhood Watch Program , but was administered by the local police department. Following an earlier call from Zimmerman, police arrived within two minutes of a gunshot during an altercation in which Zimmerman fatally shot Martin, who did not possess any weapons. Zimmerman was subsequently taken into custody, treated for head injuries, then questioned for five hours. The police chief said that Zimmerman was released because there was no evidence to refute Zimmerman's claim of having acted in self-defense, and that under Florida's  Stand Your Ground  statute, the police were prohibited by law from making an arrest. The police chief also said that Zimmerman had had a right to defend himself with lethal force. As news of the case spread, thousands of protesters across the United States called for Zimmerman's arrest and a full investigation. Six weeks after the shooting, amid widespread, intense, and in some cases  misleading media coverage , Zimmerman was  charged with murder  by a  special prosecutor  appointed by Governor  Rick Scott .

The column went on to say that Cohen "can understand why Zimmerman was suspicious and why he thought Martin was wearing a uniform we all recognize;" in any case, he also points out that "What I'm trying to deal with is, I'm trying to remove this fear from racism. I don't think it's racism to say, 'this person looks like a menace,'" he explained. "Now, a menace in another part of the country could be a white guy wearing a wife-beater under-shirt. Or, if you're a black guy in the South and you come around the corner and you see a member of the Ku Klux Klan". Towards the end of the column, Cohen calls Trayvon Martin "a young man understandably suspected because he was black".

State's Witness 8, Rachel Jeantel, testified that Martin, during his telephone conversation with her just prior to the shooting, had referred to Zimmerman as a "creepy-ass cracker". On cross-examination, West asked Jeantel, "So it was racial, but it was because Trayvon Martin put race in this?" and "You don't think that 'creepy ass cracker' is a racial comment?" Jeantel replied that she believed race was involved because Martin was being followed by a white man, not because Martin had called Zimmerman a "creepy-ass cracker." She said that people in her community call white people "cracker" and she did not find the term offensive. Jeantel also testified that Martin, during his telephone conversation, referred to Zimmerman as a " nigga ." Jeantel said that Martin's use of the word "nigga" to describe Zimmerman was "slang" when asked by lead prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda.

She said that Martin told her that a man was watching him from his vehicle while talking on the phone before the man started following Martin. Martin told his friend at one point that he had lost the man but the man suddenly appeared again. The friend, originally known only as "Witness 8" (now known as Rachel Jeantel), said that she told Martin to run to the townhouse where he was staying with his father and his father's fiancée.

She immediately attempted to call him back, but was unable to reach him. Crump stated that he would turn the information over to the Justice Department because "the family does not trust the Sanford Police Department to have anything to do with the investigation." Martin's friend was subsequently interviewed by state prosecutors on April 2, 2012. During her interview with the prosecutor, Martin's friend recounted her last phone call with Martin and added that Martin had described the man as "crazy and creepy", watching him from a vehicle while the man was talking on the phone. She also testified that Martin referred to Zimmerman as a "creepy ass  cracker " and " nigga " during their telephone conversation. On March 6, 2013, prosecutors admitted that she had lied under oath, when she falsely testified that she had been in the hospital on the day of Martin's funeral. She later admitted being embarrassed about lying and that she felt guilty about Martin's death and not doing more to help. Crump had refused to disclose the identity of Witness 8, stating that she was only 16, a minor at the time of the shooting, and asked the media to respect her privacy. It was subsequently revealed that she was actually 18 at the time when she said she was on the phone with Martin. According to the defense, her actual age had been edited out of previously released disclosures. Crump has denied intentionally giving any misleading statements about her age. Witness 8 was subsequently identified as Rachel Jeantel, a friend with whom Martin had attended elementary school and high school.

Cutcher and her roommate heard the pair in their backyard and a "very young voice" whining, with no sounds of a fight. They heard a gunshot; the crying stopped immediately, and they saw Zimmerman on his knees straddling Martin on the ground. Mary Cutcher phoned police after the fatal shooting and said the black man was standing over another man, although Trayvon Martin was already dead. According to the Orlando Sentinel article, "Police spokesman Sgt. Dave Morgenstern [on March 15] issued a statement disputing Cutcher's version of events, calling her statements to WFTV 'inconsistent with her sworn testimony to police'". However, Cutcher and her roommate maintain that their account of the incident to the police did not agree with Zimmerman's, and they demanded the police issue a retraction.

She said, "George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with." She said that as the jury began deliberations, she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, and she held to her position that Zimmerman should be found guilty even after all the other jurors had decided to find him not guilty. However, she said that after nine hours of deliberations, she realized that there was not enough evidence to convict Zimmerman under Florida law: "As the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty....you can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty." The juror said that she felt like she owed Martin's parents an apology because she felt she had let them down.

On July 13, a jury acquitted Zimmerman of the charges of second degree murder and manslaughter. For three years, the  U. S. Department of Justice  (DOJ) investigated Zimmerman on civil rights charges. In February 2015, the DOJ concluded there was not sufficient evidence that Zimmerman intentionally violated the civil rights of Martin, saying the Zimmerman case did not meet the "high standard" for a federal  hate crime  prosecution. In response to his acquittal Zimmerman said he felt free to speak his opinion "without fear of retaliation". Zimmerman criticized the government and  President Obama . He believed Obama inflamed racial tensions. "He by far overstretched, overreached, even broke the law in certain aspects to where you have an innocent American being prosecuted by the federal government," Zimmerman said.

Martin, who was serving a school suspension, had gone with his father on a visit to his father's fiancée at her  townhouse  at  The Retreat at Twin Lakes  in Sanford. On the evening of February 26, Martin went to a convenience store and purchased candy and a canned drink. As Martin returned from the store, he walked through a neighborhood that had been victimized by robberies several times that year. Zimmerman, a member of the community watch, spotted him and called the Sanford Police to report him for suspicious behavior. Moments later, there was an altercation between the two individuals in which Zimmerman shot Martin in the chest. Zimmerman, who was injured in the altercation, was not charged at the time of the shooting by the Sanford Police, who said that there was no evidence to refute his claim of self-defense and that Florida's  stand your ground law  prohibited law-enforcement officials from arresting or charging him. After national media focused on the tragedy, Zimmerman was eventually charged and tried in Martin's death.  A jury acquitted Zimmerman  of second-degree murder and manslaughter in July 2013.

Those testifying to the task force include Buddy Jacobs, a lawyer representing the Florida Prosecuting Attorney's Association.  Jacobs recommended the law's repeal, feeling that modifying the law would not fix its problems.  Florida governor  Rick Scott  plans his own investigation into the law.  In a July 16, 2013 speech in the wake of the jury verdict  acquitting George Zimmerman of charges  stemming from the shooting death of  Trayvon Martin , Attorney General  Eric Holder  criticized stand-your-ground laws as "senselessly expand[ing] the concept of self-defense and sow[ing] dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods."  The defendant, George Zimmerman, claims he was restrained at the time of the shooting, thus allowing no option for retreat and making 'stand your ground' irrelevant to the case.  Florida's legislature is currently considering a bill that would allow people to show a gun or fire a warning shot during a confrontation without drawing a lengthy prison sentence.

The events received considerable attention in the U.S. and elsewhere, attracting protesters from outside the region. They generated a vigorous national debate about the relationship between law enforcement and  African Americans , and about police  use-of-force   doctrine in Missouri  and nationwide. A St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, and he was exonerated of criminal wrongdoing by the  United States Department of Justice .

Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans:  Michael Brown , resulting in  protests and unrest in Ferguson , and  Eric Garner  in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody.

105_4	CAR_3ef9de7c4ca77fa3cd5eac57bb5ffccc8f7c716c	Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a "postracial America." However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as "racial venom" directed at Obama's presidency. In July 2009, prominent African-American  Harvard  professor  Henry Louis Gates, Jr. , was arrested at his  Cambridge, Massachusetts  home by a local police officer, sparking a  controversy  after Obama stated that the police acted "stupidly" in handling the incident. To reduce tensions, Obama invited Gates and police officer to the White House in what became known as the "Beer Summit". Several other incidents during Obama's presidency sparked outrage in the  African-American  community and/or the law enforcement community, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists. The  acquittal  of  George Zimmerman  following the  shooting of Trayvon Martin  sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he noted that "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago." The shooting of  Michael Brown  in  Ferguson, Missouri   sparked a wave of protests . These and other events led to the birth of the  Black Lives Matter  movement, which campaigns against violence and  systemic racism  toward  black people . Some in the law enforcement community criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police. Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups. In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried "a great deal" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.

This amendment was added, in part, as a response to the  Black Lives Matter  movement, which seeks to end  police brutality  against black people, with some advocates of the amendment using the slogan " Blue Lives Matter ". Since the inception of Black Lives Matter, critics have found some of the movement's rhetoric anti-police, with the author of the amendment,  Lance Harris , stating some "were employing a deliberate campaign to terrorize our officers". Despite  the killing of a Texas sheriff  in 2015 and  the killings of two NYPD officers  in the previous year, in response to the  death of Eric Garner  and the  shooting of Michael Brown , there was little to no data suggesting hate crimes against law enforcement were a common problem when the bill was passed. A little less than two months after the amendment was passed,  Baton Rouge  was in the national spotlight after the  Baton Rouge Police  killing of  Alton Sterling  by two white police officers. This sparked protests in Baton Rouge, resulting in hundreds of arrests and increased racial tension nationally. In the week during those protests,  five police officers were killed in Dallas , and the week after the protests,  three more officers were killed in Baton Rouge . Both perpetrators were killed and the motives behind both shootings were responses to the recent police killings by police officers of black men.

Early in July 2015, there was a rumor circulating that Anonymous was calling for a Day of Rage  protests in retaliation for the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, which would entail violent protests and riots. This rumor was based off a video that was not posted with the official Anonymous YouTube account. None of the twitter accounts associated with Anonymous had tweeted anything in relation to a Day of Rage, and the rumors were identical to past rumors that had circulated in 2014 following the death of Mike Brown. Instead, on July 15, a twitter account associated with Anonymous posted a series of tweets calling for a day of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The twitter account used the hashtag "#FridayofSolidarity" to coordinate protests across the nation, and emphasized the fact that the Friday of Solidarity was intended for peaceful protests. The account also stated that the group was unaware of any Day of Rage plans.

A typical recollection by Dorian Johnson was phrased as "[Michael Brown] turned around, and he put his hands in the air, and he started to get down." Three days after the killing of Michael Brown, Johnson told  MSNBC  that Brown said, "I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!"

The disputed details of Brown’s death sparked protests and  civil unrest in Ferguson , across the United States, and internationally.  The dispute arose from dueling narratives of why and how the altercation occurred. Officer Wilson and eyewitnesses argued different accounts of what happened.  This confusion, along with  aggressive policing  following Brown’s death, led to heated debate and examination of the relationship between policing practices and communities of color. The protests and civil unrest continued on November 24, 2014 after a St. Louis grand jury found Darren Wilson not guilty of criminal charges. After the verdict was announced protests flared in Ferguson and in nearly every major U.S. city. On November 29, 2014, Darren Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department with no severance or benefits.  Although over $500,000 was raised by Wilson’s supporters via crowdfunding.

Officer Wilson's account was that when he attempted to question Michael Brown he was attacked.  There was a struggle, Brown attempting and almost succeeding in gaining possession of his, Officer Wilson's weapon.  Due to the struggle the weapon discharged, slightly wounding Brown, who then fled.  Wilson gave brief chase firing upon Brown, ultimately shooting and killing Brown when Brown turned to confront him and, upon Wilson's account, charged at him.

Cynthia Sheard claims that it is a result of “the ways in which words fail us… all-too-common images of violence must make us wonder, indeed, whether words can make any difference in our lives.” Although the riot may have devastating consequences, it is purposeful in its ability to create recognition of a problem across a nation, bridging the gaps of class and distance the issue may otherwise find insurmountable. For example, the  Black Lives Matter  movement is now global due to the riots following the kairotic police  shooting of Michael Brown  in Ferguson, MO. Many of those who have never before been affected by police violence towards black males have now seen the movement “in their own backyards,” and protests have arisen across the country, while both the mainstream and social media coverage of Ferguson has enabled this issue to be prescient in the minds of many far-removed citizens.

Lamar takes his opinions further to lend his position on black on black crime in the song " The Blacker the Berry ". He criticizes himself and his community by rapping, "So why did I weep when  Trayvon Martin  was in the street? / When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?"

Cullors wrote the  hashtag   to corroborate Garza's use of the phrase in making a  Facebook  post about the Martin case.

105_5	CAR_2b197f6f5f324bdcf294e8723d6eaaf6666b5b9f	In 2013, the movement began with the use of the  hashtag  #BlackLivesMatter on  social media , after  the acquittal  of  George Zimmerman  in  the shooting death  of African-American teen  Trayvon Martin . Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans:  Michael Brown , resulting in  protests and unrest in Ferguson , and  Eric Garner  in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the  2016 United States presidential election . The originators of the hashtag and call to action,  Alicia Garza ,  Patrisse Cullors , and  Opal Tometi , expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.

It is an affirmation of Black folks’ contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression."

Our lives matter, Black Lives Matter" which Cullors then shared with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. Garza's organization Black Lives Matter was spurred on by the deaths of black people by police in recent media and racial disparities within the U.S. criminal justice system. She was also struck by the similarities of  Trayvon Martin  to her younger brother, feeling that it could have been him killed instead. Garza led the 2015  Freedom Ride  to Ferguson, organized by Cullors and  Darnell Moore  that launched the building of BlackLivesMatter chapters across the United States.

Garza wrote a Facebook post titled "A Love Note to Black People" in which she said: "Our Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.” Once the hashtag was formed, it has been a rallying cry for various organizing efforts across the country centered on Black lives.
105_5	CAR_7abdbffc54acfaa9a9e687cfca71908795f14c2b	In order to prepare for protests physically and psychologically, demonstrators received training in nonviolence. According to former Civil Rights activist Bruce Hartford, there are two main branches of nonviolence training. There is the philosophical method, which involves understanding the method of nonviolence and why it is considered useful, and there is the tactical method, which ultimately teaches demonstrators "how to be a protestor—how to sit-in, how to picket, how to defend yourself against attack, giving training on how to remain cool when people are screaming racist insults into your face and pouring stuff on you and hitting you" (Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement). The philosophical method of nonviolence, in the American Civil Rights Movement, was largely inspired by  Mahatma Gandhi 's "non-cooperation" with the British colonists in India, which was intended to gain attention so that the public would either "intervene in advance," or "provide public pressure in support of the action to be taken" (Erikson, 415). As Hartford explains it, philosophical nonviolence training aims to "shape the individual person's attitude and mental response to crises and violence" (Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement). Hartford and activists like him, who trained in tactical nonviolence, considered it necessary in order to ensure physical safety, instill discipline, teach demonstrators how to demonstrate, and form mutual confidence among demonstrators (Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement).

On  Real Time with Bill Maher ,  Bill Maher  expressed support for use of the "Black Lives Matter" phrase, stating that "'All Lives Matter' implies that all lives are equally at risk, and they're not". Founders of the Black Lives Matter movement have responded to criticism of the movement's exclusivity, saying, "#BlackLivesMatter doesn't mean your life isn't important – it means that Black lives, which are seen without value within  White supremacy , are important to your liberation."

Under this view, there is no claim that America has attained a fully post-racial society, however it is argued that news selection is skewed toward amplifying racial conflict, events demonstrating racial harmony are dismissed as non-newsworthy, and that such media conflict-bias acts to undermine trust and impede progress.   Rather, any true measure of race relations must gauge the everyday daily experiences of Americans in interacting with people of differing backgrounds.   An assumption is that the media will cherry-pick the most outrageous, racially-inflammatory events to cover no matter how infrequently they are occurring, and thus misreport progress toward a post-racial ideal.  The central tenet of post-racial problem-solving practice is to seek the "alternative explanation" when conflict arises (presuming non-racist motives in others), in order to find common ground and creatively resolve the conflict.   Examples of post-racial framing in attacking CJS misconduct are video recording of all police-citizen interactions, creating a Citizens Review Board with investigative powers, and assigning an independent prosecutor.   Or, in the educational sphere, creating charters, academies and school choice to turn around under-performing schools.   The divide in public opinion on the status of race in America was reflected in reactions to the  Black Lives Matter movement . In response to the "black lives matter" rallying cry, some people, including politicians, began using the phrase "all lives matter". After a sheriff's deputy in  Harris County, Texas , was fatally shot while pumping gas in August, Sheriff Ron Hickman claimed that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter activists had contributed to the killing and said, "We’ve heard 'black lives matter'. All lives matter. Well, cops’ lives matter, too. So why don’t we just drop the qualifier and just say 'lives matter', and take that to the bank.' 
105_6	CAR_4bb54e1efe57c9e5fd97856cb3c38c50d8451668	On May 26, 2016,  Louisiana  was the first state to add  police officers  and  firefighters  to their state hate crime statute, when Governor  John Bel Edwards  signed an amendment from the legislature into law. This amendment was added, in part, as a response to the  Black Lives Matter  movement, which seeks to end  police brutality  against black people, with some advocates of the amendment using the slogan " Blue Lives Matter ". Since the inception of Black Lives Matter, critics have found some of the movement's rhetoric anti-police, with the author of the amendment,  Lance Harris , stating some "were employing a deliberate campaign to terrorize our officers". Despite  the killing of a Texas sheriff  in 2015 and  the killings of two NYPD officers  in the previous year, in response to the  death of Eric Garner  and the  shooting of Michael Brown , there was little to no data suggesting hate crimes against law enforcement were a common problem when the bill was passed. A little less than two months after the amendment was passed,  Baton Rouge  was in the national spotlight after the  Baton Rouge Police  killing of  Alton Sterling  by two white police officers. This sparked protests in Baton Rouge, resulting in hundreds of arrests and increased racial tension nationally. In the week during those protests,  five police officers were killed in Dallas , and the week after the protests,  three more officers were killed in Baton Rouge . Both perpetrators were killed and the motives behind both shootings were responses to the recent police killings by police officers of black men.

During the October 2015 Democratic Presidential Debate candidates were asked the question "Do all lives matter or do black lives matter?" All three candidates were careful to avoid using the phrase "All Lives Matter" in their responses and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley apologized for using the alternative "all lives matter" slogan in an earlier campaign stop. The change in discourse away from "All Lives Matter" came after criticism from Black Lives Matter supporters and protests during campaign stops.

President Obama said in October, "There is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that’s not happening in other communities."  Andrew Rosenthal  wrote, similarly, in The New York Times, "The point of 'Black Lives Matter' is that the lives of African-Americans have come under special and deadly threat since before the birth of this country."

Sanders issued a platform in response. Nikki Stephens, the operator of a Facebook page called "Black Lives Matter: Seattle" issued an apology to Sanders' supporters, claiming these actions did not represent her understanding of BLM. She was then sent messages by members of the Seattle Chapter which she described as threatening, and was forced to change the name of her group to "Black in Seattle". The founders of Black Lives Matter stated that they had not issued an apology.In August 2015, the  Democratic National Committee  passed a resolution supporting Black Lives Matter.

In reply,  Bernie Sanders  stated, "Black lives matter."  Martin O'Malley  said, "Black lives matter," and that the "movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color." In response, Hillary Clinton pushed for criminal justice reform, and said, "We need a new New Deal for communities of color."  Jim Webb , on the other hand, replied: "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters."  Hillary Clinton  was not directly asked the same question, but was instead asked: "What would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?" Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws". Without policy change, she felt "we’ll be back here in 10 years having the same conversation." In June 2015, Clinton used the phrase "all lives matter" in a speech about the opportunities of young people of color, prompting backlash that she may misunderstand the message of "Black Lives Matter"

The song "The Black Dove" was inspired by the  Black Lives Matter  movement. White noted that "As a white person, there are so many misconceptions to what racism is, but the fact that you can turn a blind eye to issues of racial brutality is a symptom of being white". Her literary inspirations are often cited to be  Cormac McCarthy ,  Emily Brontë ,  Edna St. Vincent Millay  and  Edgar Allan Poe .

The song then ends with  Jamila Woods  singing, "Your silence is a luxury. Hip-hop is not a luxury. What I got for me, it is for me? What we made, we made to set us free."

He also said "that is a legitimate issue that we've got to address."

105_9	CAR_01cf49132210b1df85be3446759a39d77c3649cd	Black Lives Matter, an activist movement that was formed to campaign against racism and what its members consider police brutality against African Americans, has contributed to a revitalization and re-examining of the Black Feminist movement. The movement itself was started by three black women, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, and has been viewed as a Black Feminist Movement first rather than as a part of the larger feminist movement. Black Lives Matter largely accepts the intersectionality of women of color, and how interlocking systems of oppression work against African American women in particular. The movement has also been critical of White Feminism as only focusing on the oppression of Women and not looking at how intersectionalities of class, race, and culture have been harming marginalized groups. According to academic scholar Angela Davis,  “Black Women face a triple oppression” of racism, classism, and sexism and Black Lives Matter has been a largely grassroots movement focused on including intersectional voices. Activism of Black Feminists in Black Lives Matter include the protests of political candidates such as Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton and hashtags such as #oscarssowhite, and #sayhername.
105_9	CAR_39e50999bbebc37805477fd2cd71b833c2379fea	Garza, with  Opal Tometi  and  Patrisse Cullors , birthed the Black Lives Matters movement. Garza is credited with inspiring the slogan when, after the July 2013 acquittal of  George Zimmerman , she posted on Facebook: "Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter, Black Lives Matter" which Cullors then shared with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. Garza's organization Black Lives Matter was spurred on by the deaths of black people by police in recent media and racial disparities within the U.S. criminal justice system. She was also struck by the similarities of  Trayvon Martin  to her younger brother, feeling that it could have been him killed instead. Garza led the 2015  Freedom Ride  to Ferguson, organized by Cullors and  Darnell Moore  that launched the building of BlackLivesMatter chapters across the United States. Garza self-identifies as a  queer  woman, and her spouse is biracial and transgender; Garza draws on all of these experiences in her organizing and activism.
105_9	CAR_74f2b35e0be096f0fdfc83cb0dbc87fa79aa1894	Black Lives Matter incorporates those traditionally on the margins of black freedom movements. The organization's website, for instance, states that Black Lives Matter is "a unique contribution that goes beyond  extrajudicial killing s of Black people by police and vigilantes" and, embracing  intersectionality , that "Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of  Black queer and trans folks , disabled folks, black- undocumented folks ,  folks with records ,  women  and all Black lives along the gender spectrum." All three founders of the Black Lives Matter movement are women, and Garza and Cullors identify as queer. The founders believe that their backgrounds have paved the way for Black Lives Matter to be an  intersectional  movement. Several hashtags such as #BlackWomenMatter, #BlackGirlsMatter, #BlackQueerLivesMatter, and #BlackTransLivesMatter have surfaced on the BLM website and throughout social media networks. Marcia Chatelain, associate professor of history at Georgetown University, has praised BLM for allowing "young, queer women [to] play a central role" in the movement.
105_9	CAR_d62770b885bae152dbfb994d6265f572a272de26	Although the movement makes an active effort to engage in discourse and conversation with the Black Lives Matter movement, #SayHerName is different in its construct, goals and methods. Feminist theorists such as Kimberle Crenshaw have pointed out that the #SayHerName movement addresses intersectionality of gender, class and disability that play out on black women and girls’ bodies (The Guardian). These are aspects that do not appear to be so readily addressed by the Black Lives Matter movement, which is specifically known as a movement addressing racial inequality within the criminal justice system. In fact, many supporters for the Black Lives Matter movement were largely sparked by outrage of the deaths of young, African-American males at the hands of police with excessive violence and no repercussion from the legal system (The Guardian). In contrast, when stories of African-American women meeting similar fates in just as harrowing circumstances were brought up, the amount of supporters and advocates seems to decrease; female victim’s names and stories are less recognized than the male victims (The Guardian). Simply put, #SayHerName wants to raise awareness of how sexism and racism simultaneously play out of colored female bodies, no matter their background, while still being a safe, inclusive space for all individuals to come together and create discourse (The Guardian).
