{"input_text": "The Galileo Terrestrial Reference Frame (GTRF) is used for the  Galileo  navigation system; currently defined as ITRF2005.\nThe company has a highest level experience, thanks to a technological expertise acquired over 50 years of activity. The company manages important space infrastructure - including the  Fucino  Space Centre, the world\u2019s largest civilian teleport - and is involved in major space programmes, including  Galileo (satellite navigation)  ,  EGNOS , Copernicus ,  COSMO-SkyMed , SICRAL  and G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk .\nIn September 2003, China intended to join the European  Galileo positioning system  project and was to invest  \u20ac 230 million ( USD 296 million,  GBP 160 million) in Galileo over the next few years. At the time, it was believed that China's \"BeiDou\" navigation system would then only be used by its armed forces. In October 2004, China officially joined the Galileo project by signing the Agreement on the Cooperation in the Galileo Program between the \"Galileo Joint Undertaking\" (GJU) and the \"National Remote Sensing Centre of China\" (NRSCC). Based on the Sino-European Cooperation Agreement on Galileo program, China Galileo Industries (CGI), the prime contractor of the China\u2019s involvement in Galileo programs, was founded in December 2004.  By April 2006, eleven cooperation projects within the Galileo framework had been signed between China and EU. However, the Hong Kong-based  South China Morning Post  reported in January 2008 that China was unsatisfied with its role in the Galileo project and was to compete with Galileo in the Asian market.\nFrequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6 and overlap with Galileo. The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under  International Telecommunication Union  (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts. It now appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.\nExamples of satellite constellations include the  Global Positioning System  (GPS),  Galileo  and  GLONASS  constellations for  navigation  and  geodesy , the  Iridium  and  Globalstar  satellite telephony services, the  Disaster Monitoring Constellation  and  RapidEye  for remote sensing, the  Orbcomm  messaging service, Russian  elliptic orbit   Molniya  and Tundra constellations, the large-scale  Teledesic  and Skybridge  broadband  constellation proposals of the 1990s, and more recent systems such as  O3b  or the  OneWeb  proposal.\nGeomatics includes the tools and techniques used in  land surveying ,  remote sensing ,  cartography ,  geographic information system s (GIS),  global-navigation satellite systems  ( GPS ,  GLONASS ,  Galileo ,  Compass ),  photogrammetry ,  geophysics ,  geography , and related forms of earth  map ping. The term was originally used in  Canada , because it is similar in origin to both French and English, but has since been adopted by the  International Organization for Standardization , the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors , and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the  United States ) have shown a preference for the term geospatial technology.\nGalileo's astronomical discoveries and investigations into the Copernican theory have led to a lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of  Jupiter  discovered by Galileo ( Io ,  Europa ,  Ganymede  and  Callisto ) as the  Galilean moons . Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the  Galileo spacecraft , the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the proposed  Galileo   global satellite navigation system , the  transformation  between  inertial system s in  classical mechanics  denoted  Galilean transformation  and the  Gal (unit) , sometimes known as the Galileo, which is a non- SI  unit of  acceleration .\nThese validation satellites were previously known as the Galileo System Testbed (GSTB) version 2 (GSTB-V2). In 2004 the Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1) project validated the on-ground algorithms for Orbit Determination and Time Synchronization (OD&TS). This project, led by ESA and  European Satellite Navigation Industries , has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the  Galileo positioning system .\nASI is a participant in many of ESA's programmes in the field of Earth Observation such as  ERS-1 ,  ERS-2 ,  ENVISAT , the  Meteosat  series and the  Galileo  satellite navigation system. The agency has also collaborated with other European and international partners such as the  Shuttle Radar Topography Mission  with NASA.\nThere are at least six  satellite navigation  systems, all of which function by transmitting  time signal s. Of the only two satellite systems with global coverage,  GPS  calculates its time signal from an epoch, whereas  GLONASS  calculates time as an offset from  UTC , with the UTC input adjusted for  leap seconds . Of the only two other systems aiming for global coverage,  Galileo  calculates from an epoch and  Beidou  calculates from UTC without adjustment for leap seconds. GPS also transmits the offset between UTC time and GPS time, and must update this offset every time there is a  leap second , requiring GPS receiving devices to handle the update correctly. In contrast, leap seconds are transparent to GLONASS users.The complexities of calculating UTC from an epoch are explained by the  European Space Agency  in Galileo documentation under \"Equations to correct system timescale to reference timescale\"\nThe mentioned QZSS TKS technology is a novel satellite timekeeping system which does not require on-board atomic clocks as used by existing navigation satellite systems such as GPS,  GLONASS  or the planned  Galileo  system. This concept is differentiated by the employment of a synchronization framework combined with lightweight steerable on-board clocks which act as transponders re-broadcasting the precise time remotely provided by the time synchronization network located on the ground. This allows the system to operate optimally when satellites are in direct contact with the ground station, making it suitable for a system like the Japanese QZSS. Low satellite mass and low satellite manufacturing and launch cost are significant advantages of this system. An outline of this concept as well as two possible implementations of the time synchronization network for QZSS were studied and published in Remote Synchronization Method for the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System and Remote Synchronization Method for the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System: study of a novel satellite timekeeping system which does not require on-board atomic clocks.\nOn 22 August 2014 Arianespace launched the first two Full Operational Capability satellites for the  Galileo satellite navigation  constellation into  Medium Earth orbit . The mission appeared to proceed normally and Arianespace reported the launch to be a success, however analysis of telemetry data provided by  ESA  and  CNES  tracking stations showed that the satellites were injected into an incorrect orbit.\nThis approach relies on  GPS  technology, currently supplied by NAVSTAR and may in future employ the pending  Galileo (satellite navigation)  system, generally adopting WGS84 and NMEA. Applications include  avalanche rescue  or  emergency  and  mountain rescue  as well as with  search and rescue , (SAR) and  combat search and rescue , (CSAR).\nAlso in 1976  Videcom international  with  British Airways ,  British Caledonian  and CCL launched  Travicom , the world's first multi-access reservations system (wholly based on Videcom technology), forming a network providing distribution for initially 2 and subsequently 49 subscribing international airlines (including British Airways, British Caledonian,  TWA ,  Pan American World Airways ,  Qantas ,  Singapore Airlines ,  Air France ,  Lufthansa ,  SAS ,  Air Canada ,  KLM ,  Alitalia ,  Cathay Pacific  and  JAL ) to thousands of travel agents in the UK. It allowed agents and airlines to communicate via a common distribution language and network, handling 97% of UK airline business trade bookings by 1987. The system went on to be replicated by Videcom in other areas of the world including the Middle East (DMARS), New Zealand, Kuwait (KMARS), Ireland, Caribbean, United States and Hong Kong. Travicom was a trading name for Travel Automation Services Ltd.   When BA (who by then owned 100% of Travel Automation Services Ltd) chose to participate in the development of the Galileo system Travicom changed its trading name to Galileo UK and a migration process was put in place to move agencies from Travicom to Galileo.\nThe Galileo system will have five main services:\nIndian Space Research Organisation  (ISRO) is contributing towards augmenting  ESA   Galileo satellite navigation system  and GPS service in northern Europe by sharing data from the  Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System  (IRNSS). ISRO  Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle  has launched  Miniaturized satellite s of several European universities and opened payload capacity on Indian  CubeSat s to European scientific experiments. India relies on  Arianespace  for the launch of  I-3K -class satellites to geosynchronous transfer orbits.\nIn 2007, Tiefensee chaired talks following which EU transport ministers agreed unanimously to end talks with a private consortium contracted to develop the  Galileo  satellite navigation system and to spend \u20ac2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) to build it themselves instead.\nGIOVE , or Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element, is the name for two  satellite s built for the  European Space Agency  (ESA) to test technology in orbit for the  Galileo positioning system .\nThe  BeiDou  and  Galileo  satellite navigation systems are under construction in 2015 but both have to add planned extra satellites to achieve their full-scale global coverage constellation goal.BeiDou Time (BDT) is a continuous time scale starting at 1 January 2006 at 0:00:00 UTC and is synchronised with UTC within 100 ns.Galileo System Time (GST) is a continuous time scale which is generated on the ground at the Galileo Control Centre in Fucino, Italy, by the Precise Timing Facility, based on averages of different atomic clocks and maintained by the Galileo Central Segment and synchronised with TAI with a nominal offset below 50 ns. The Galileo navigation message includes the differences between GST, UTC and GPST (to promote interoperability).\nThe  ESA  has launched the first set of satellites required for the  Galileo GPS network . This is mainly a political decision by the EU to reduce dependence on American military technology and can thus be seen as a political statement. The Galileo system is operated under civilian control, as opposed to GPS which is operated under American military control. It provides more precise navigation and coverage at higher altitudes.\nThe first Galileo test  satellite , the  GIOVE-A , was launched 28 December 2005, while the  first satellite  to be part of the operational system was launched on 21 October 2011. As of December 2016 the system has 18 of 30 satellites in orbit. Galileo started offering Early Operational Capability (EOC) on 15 December 2016 and is expected to reach Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2019. The complete 30-satellite Galileo system (24 operational and 6 active spares) is expected by 2020.\nNowadays, several hundred geodetic satellites are in orbit, supplemented by a large number of  remote sensing  satellites and  navigation  systems like  GPS  and  Glonass , which will be followed by the European  Galileo  satellites in 2013. While these developments have made satellite-based geodetic network surveying more flexible and cost effective than its terrestrial equivalent, the continued existence of  fixed point  networks is still needed for administrative and legal purposes on local and regional scales. Global geodetic networks cannot be defined to be fixed, since  geodynamic s are continuously changing the position of all  continent s by 2 to 20 cm per year. Therefore, modern global networks like  ETRS89  or  ITRF  show not only  coordinate s of their \"fixed points\", but also their annual  velocities .\nGADEROS ( Galileo  Demonstrator for Railway Operation System) is a study sponsored by the  European Commission . The purpose is to make use of the Galileo  Global Navigation Satellite System  (GNSS) when it becomes functional in 2008.\nUnlike the American  GPS , Russian  GLONASS , and European  Galileo  systems, which use  medium Earth orbit  satellites, BeiDou-1 uses satellites in  geostationary orbit .  This means that the system does not require a large constellation of satellites, but it also limits the coverage to areas on Earth where the satellites are visible. The area that can be serviced is from longitude 70\u00b0E to 140\u00b0E and from latitude 5\u00b0N to 55\u00b0N. A frequency of the system is 2491.75 MHz.\nSince August 22, 2014 Soyuz ST-B launch vehicles with Fregat-MT upper stages have performed three successful launches, six  Galileo (satellite navigation)  navigation satellites have been inserted into their target orbits in frame of  Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre  ongoing ESA programme.\nA radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy. This is what is done in  satellite navigation systems  such as the  Global Positioning System .   GPS ,  Galileo  and  GLONASS   satellite navigation system s have one or more caesium, rubidium or hydrogen maser atomic clocks on each satellite, referenced to a clock or clocks on the ground. Dedicated timing receivers can serve as local time standards, with a precision better than 50 ns. The recent revival and enhancement of  LORAN , a land-based radio navigation system, will provide another multiple source time distribution system.\nCompass-M1 is an experimental satellite launched for signal testing and validation and for the frequency filing on 14 April 2007. The role of Compass-M1 for Compass is similar to the role of the  GIOVE  satellites for the Galileo system. The orbit of Compass-M1 is nearly circular, has an altitude of 21,150 km and an inclination of 55.5 degrees.\nSupporters of the Cospas-Sarsat system are preparing to demonstrate and evaluate a new capability called MEOSAR (Medium Earth Orbit Search and Rescue satellites), consisting of  SAR  transponders aboard navigation satellites of Europe, Russia and the United States.  In its current (project) form, the U.S. space-segment component is being called the  Distress Alerting Satellite System  (DASS) by  NASA .  MEOSAR will consist of  SAR  transponders aboard Europe's  Galileo  constellation, Russian Glonass spacecraft ( Glonass-K 1 having been launched on 26 February 2011), and the U.S.  GPS  satellite constellation.  MEOSAR assets will report signals from Cospas-Sarsat  search and rescue   beacon s in the 406.0\u2013406.1 MHz band.  MEOSAR satellites will be able to provide near-instantaneous detection, identification, and location determination of 406 MHz beacons.  The beacon can transmit coordinates of its position encoded in the alert message (if the position information is available from an on-board  GNSS  receiver or another source such as a ship's navigation sensors).  Or the position can be determined independently by the receiving LUT by analyzing the frequency-difference-of-arrival (related to  Doppler -induced variations) and/or the time-difference-of-arrival.  It is planned that the MEOSAR system will be able to download information back to the  distress radiobeacon  by encoding \"Return Link Service\" messages into the Galileo navigation data stream.\nThe RINEX format is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new types of measurements and new satellite navigation systems. The most common version at present is 2.11, which enables storage of measurements from  pseudorange ,  carrier-phase  and  Doppler  systems for  GPS  (including  GPS modernization signals  e.g. L5 and L2C),  GLONASS ,  Galileo ,  Beidou , along with data from  EGNOS  and  WAAS   satellite based augmentation system s (SBAS),  QZSS , simultaneously. RINEX version 3.02 was submitted in April 2013, and is capable of new measurements from  GPS  or  Galileo  systems. The most recent version is RINEX 3.03 from July 2015.\nGalileo is the  global navigation satellite system  (GNSS) that is currently being created by the  European Union  (EU) through the  European Space Agency  (ESA) and the  European GNSS Agency  (GSA), headquartered in  Prague  in the  Czech Republic , with two ground operations centres,  Oberpfaffenhofen  near  Munich  in Germany and  Fucino  in Italy. The \u20ac5 billion project is named after the Italian astronomer  Galileo Galilei . One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an indigenous alternative high-precision positioning system upon which European nations can rely, independently from the Russian  GLONASS , Indian  NAVIC , Chinese  Bei Dou  and US  GPS  systems, in case they were disabled by their operators.The use of basic (low-precision) Galileo services will be free and open to everyone. The high-precision capabilities will be available for paying commercial users. Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre precision, and better positioning services at high  latitude s than other positioning systems.\nAs of October 2011, only the  United States  NAVSTAR  Global Positioning System  (GPS) and the  Russia n  GLONASS  are fully globally operational GNSSs. The  European Union 's  Galileo positioning system  is a next generation GNSS in the initial deployment phase, scheduled to be operational by 2013.  China  has indicated it may expand its regional  Beidou navigation system  into a global system.\nGalileo is to provide a new global  search and rescue  (SAR) function as part of the  MEOSAR system . Satellites will be equipped with a transponder which will relay distress signals from  emergency beacons  to the  Rescue coordination centre , which will then initiate a rescue operation. At the same time, the system is projected to provide a signal, the Return Link Message (RLM), to the emergency beacon, informing them that their situation has been detected and help is on the way. This latter feature is new and is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing  Cospas-Sarsat system , which do not provide feedback to the user. Tests in February 2014 found that for Galileo's  search and rescue  function, operating as part of the existing International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, 77% of simulated distress locations can be pinpointed within 2 km, and 95% within 5 km.\nIn 2004 the Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1) project validated the on-ground algorithms for Orbit Determination and Time Synchronisation (OD&TS). This project, led by ESA and  European Satellite Navigation Industries , has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the Galileo positioning system.\nThe Inside GNSS editorial content has been heavily weighted towards issues of the four major GNSS operators: the United States (GPS), Russia ( GLONASS ), China ( BeiDou ) and the European Union ( Galileo ). Regional and augmentation systems such as those developed by the United States ( WAAS ,  SBAS ), Japan ( QZSS ) and Europe ( EGNOS ) as well as  eLoran , the terrestrial radionavigation system, are also covered.\nThe  European Union  and  European Space Agency  agreed in March 2002 to introduce their own alternative to GPS, called the  Galileo positioning system . Galileo became operational on 15 December 2016    At an estimated cost of EUR 3.0 billion, the system of 30  MEO  satellites was originally scheduled to be operational in 2010. The original year to become operational was 2014. The first experimental satellite was launched on 28 December 2005. Galileo is expected to be compatible with the  modernized GPS  system. The receivers will be able to combine the signals from both Galileo and GPS satellites to greatly increase the accuracy. Galileo is expected to be in full service in 2020 and at a substantially higher cost.The main modulation used in Galileo Open Service signal  is the  Composite Binary Offset Carrier  (CBOC) modulation.\nThe  Galileo positioning system  is another EU infrastructure project. Galileo is a proposed  Satellite navigation  system, to be built by the EU and launched by the  European Space Agency  (ESA). The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated  Global Positioning System , but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system.\nA satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system (GNSS).  only the  United States  NAVSTAR  Global Positioning System  (GPS), the  Russia n  GLONASS  and the  EU s  Galileo  are global operational GNSSs.  China  is in the process of expanding its regional  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System  into the global  Compass navigation system  by 2020. The  European Union's   Galileo  is a global GNSS scheduled to be fully operational by 2020. India currently has  satellite-based augmentation system ,  GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation  (GAGAN), which enhances the accuracy of NAVSTAR GPS and GLONASS positions. India has already launched the  IRNSS , with an operational name NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), a constellation of satellites for navigation in and around the  Indian Subcontinent . It is expected to be fully operational by June 2016.  France  and  Japan  are in the process of developing regional navigation systems as well.\nReal Time Kinematic (RTK)  satellite navigation  is a technique used to enhance the precision of position data derived from satellite-based positioning systems (global navigation satellite systems,  GNSS ) such as  GPS ,  GLONASS ,  Galileo , and  BeiDou . It uses measurements of the  phase  of the signal's  carrier wave , rather than the information content of the signal, and relies on a single reference station or interpolated virtual station to provide real-time corrections, providing up to  centimetre -level  accuracy . With reference to GPS in particular, the system is commonly referred to as Carrier-Phase Enhancement, or CPGPS. It has application in  land survey  and in  hydrographic survey .\nThe project did officially end in 2005 however it was continued in other projects building on its results. The  ESA  started in 2006 the project RUNE (Railway User Navigation Equipment) to use  Galileo (satellite system)  to create \"virtual  balise s\" and the projekt GEORAIL at the UIC continues to research satellite navigation in rail transport since 2004. the 6. Framework Programme of the EU contains GIRASOLE (accompanied by GPS-LOC of the SCNF), GRAIL and M-TRADE which ran until 2007. In England LOCASYS project was started continuing the LOCOPROL project with a target on dependability until 2009. In Belgium the LOCOPROL pilot railway track was extended in the TransLogisTIC project between 2007 and 2009 looking into integration of railway and classic fleet management. The actual usage of satellite navigation in railway systems can be currently found systems like the Tr@in-MD of SCNF for dangerous goodswagons traceability and G\u00e9d\u00e9on of SCNF fortracking of freight.\nMontaudran is undergoing  urban renewal .  Housing is being built to prepare the area to receive the Aerospace Campus to be built on the old runway between the railway and the ring road.  It is expected to be the most productive aeronautical campus  in Europe, and the future base of the  Galileo  satellite navigation system.\nThe two core satellite constellations are the  Global Positioning System  (GPS) of the US and the  Global Navigation Satellite System  (GLONASS) of Russia/India.  The third constellation will be the European Union  Galileo system  when it becomes fully operational.  These systems provide independent capabilities and can be used in combination with future core constellations and augmentation systems. Signals from core satellite are received by ground reference stations and any errors in the signals are identified.  Each station in the network relays the data to area-wide master stations where correction information for specific geographical areas is computed.  The correction message is prepared and uplinked to a  geostationary communication satellite  (GEO) via a ground uplink station. This message is broadcast to receivers on board aircraft flying within the broadcast coverage area of the system. The system is known in the US as WAAS ( Wide Area Augmentation System ), in Europe as EGNOS ( European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System ), in Japan as MSAS ( MTSAT Satellite Based Augmentation System ) and in India as GAGAN ( GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation ).\nOne of the reasons given for developing Galileo as an independent system was that position information from GPS can be made significantly inaccurate by the deliberate application of universal  Selective Availability  (SA) by the US military. GPS is widely used worldwide for civilian applications; Galileo's proponents argued that civil infrastructure, including airplane navigation and landing, should not rely solely upon a system with this vulnerability.\nIn addition to GPS, other systems are in use or under development, mainly because of a potential denial of access and potential monitoring by the US government.  The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System ( GLONASS ) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s. GLONASS can be added to GPS devices which makes more satellites available and enabling positions to be fixed more quickly and accurately, to within 2 meters  There are also the European Union  Galileo positioning system , China's  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System , the Japanese  Quasi-Zenith Satellite System , and India's  Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System  (NAVIC).\nOn 7 May 2014, the first two FOC satellites landed in Guyana for their joint launch planned in summer Originally planned for launch during 2013, problems tooling and establishing the production line for assembly led to a delay of a year in serial production of Galileo satellites. These two satellites (Galileo satellites GSAT-201 and GSAT-202) were launched on 22 August 2014. The names of these satellites are Doresa and Milena named after European children who had previously won a drawing contest. On 23 August 2014, launch service provider Arianespace announced that the  flight VS09  experienced anomaly and satellites were injected into an incorrect orbit.\nThe on-board  inertial navigation system  (INS) is fully integrated with the  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System , and provisions are made for future upgrades to include  Galileo (satellite navigation) / GPS / GLONASS  when expanded capabilities of these systems become available.  For potential export customers, it can select the  satellite navigation system s of its choice, though  GPS  is usually the norm.  In addition, despite the developer\u2019s claim that the navigational system of Z-10 can utilize a variety of satellite navigation to improve its accuracy, the integrated  GPS  corrected INS is the only system that has been shown to the public at Zhuhai Airshows and other defense exhibitions.  A modified  Blue Sky navigation pod  can also be carried by Z-10.  Information is shared via a secured data-link that provides real time and near-real time information.\nThe second application of space militarisation currently in use is GPS or  Global Positioning System .   This  satellite navigation system  is used for determining one's precise location and providing a highly accurate  time reference  almost anywhere on  Earth  or in  Earth orbit . It uses an  intermediate circular orbit  (ICO)  satellite constellation  of at least 24 satellites.  The GPS system was designed by and is controlled by the  United States Department of Defense  and can be used by anyone, free of charge. The cost of maintaining the system is approximately US$400 million per year, including the replacement of ageing satellites. The first of 24 satellites that form the current GPS constellation (Block II) was placed into orbit on February 14, 1989. The 52nd GPS satellite since the beginning in 1978 was launched November 6, 2004 aboard a  Delta II  rocket.The primary military purposes are to allow improved command and control of forces through improved location awareness, and to facilitate accurate targeting of  smart bombs ,  cruise missiles , or other munitions. The satellites also carry nuclear detonation detectors, which form a major portion of the  United States Nuclear Detonation Detection System .   Europe an concern about the level of control over the GPS network and commercial issues has resulted in the planned  Galileo positioning system . Russia already operates an independent system called  GLONASS  (global navigation system), the system operates with 24 satellites that are deployed in 3 orbital planes as opposed to the 4 GPS is deployed in.The Chinese \"Beidou\" system provides China a similar regional (not global) navigation capability. India is currently developing its own regional satellite navigation system, the  Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System .\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System  (GNSS) receivers, using the  GPS ,  GLONASS ,  Galileo  or  Beidou  system, are used in many applications. The first systems were developed in the 20th century, mainly to help military personnel find their way, but civilian applications soon became numerous.\nThe company was the primary construction company for the  Galileo positioning system , tasked with developing and building the satellites and components for the  ground segment  infrastructure of this satellite navigation system. The partner firms committed to not construct competing products for Galileo. However, some competition came from  Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd , which successfully built and launched the first  GIOVE-A  testbed satellite, and which was then awarded a contract for a followon  GIOVE-A2  satellite while the joint venture's  GIOVE-B  satellite remained on the ground awaiting launch. Since that time, the  GIOVE-B  satellite successfully launched, although after the Galileo project had been abandoned by European Satellite Navigation Industries and taken up by the  European Union .\nThe European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a  satellite based augmentation system  (SBAS) developed by the  European Space Agency , the  European Commission  and  EUROCONTROL . It supplements the  GPS ,  GLONASS  and  Galileo   satellite navigation systems  by reporting on the reliability and accuracy of their positioning data and sending out corrections.\nTwo GNSS systems are currently in operation: the United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Federation's Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). A third, Europe's Galileo, is slated to reach full operational capacity in 2008.\nThe Galileo positioning system is another EU infrastructure project. Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system, to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), and is to be operational by 2012.\nGalileo is the informal name for the European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), a system that will offer users anywhere in the world near pinpoint geographic positioning when it becomes fully operational by 2008.alileo is named for the Italian astronomer, mathematician, and physicist, Galileo Galilei. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Galileo applied mathematics to the study of physical science.\nThere are 4 Galileo Satellites, which are currently un used, but are the start of the European satellite constealltion which is a work in progress. They orbit at 24,000Kms above sea level. On top of all that, there are 10 Chinese navigation satellites called COMPASS orbiting in an orbit above China and Asia.\nGNSS-2 [citation needed] is the second generation of systems that independently provides a full civilian satellite navigation system, exemplified by the European Galileo positioning system. These systems will provide the accuracy and integrity monitoring necessary for civil navigation; including aircraft.\nThere are other similar systems to GPS in the world, which are all classified as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). GLONASS is a satellite constellation system built by Russia. The European Space Agency is creating Galileo, while China is creating BeiDou.\nIt is a global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.\nSoon satellites 7 and 8 will be sent to complement the first public global satellite navigation system. A huge undertaking which goes beyond the technology challenge - with the Galileo system, Europe will provide a full range of services and applications across many different areas for citizens in Europe and beyond.\nGNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is a satellite system that is used to pinpoint the geographic location of a user's receiver anywhere in the world. Two GNSS systems are currently in operation: the United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Federation's Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). A third, Europe's Galileo, is slated to reach full operational capacity in 2008.", "key": "50_5", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.106834", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
