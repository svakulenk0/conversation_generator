{"input_text": "Social psychology often employs the experimental method in an attempt to understand human social interaction.  Social psychology conducts its experiments both inside and outside of the laboratory. One notable social psychology experiment is the  Stanford prison experiment  conducted by  Philip Zimbardo  in 1971, although the extremity of this field experiment is not prototypical of the field. Another notable study is the  Stanley Milgram  obedience experiment, often known as the  Milgram experiment .\n2007.  Philip Zimbardo  (Stanford Professor, known for the  Stanford Prison Experiment )\nPhilip George Zimbardo (born March 23, 1933) is a  psychologist  and a  professor emeritus  at  Stanford University . He became known for his 1971  Stanford prison experiment  and has since authored various introductory psychology books, textbooks for college students, and other notable works, including The Lucifer Effect,  The Time Paradox and The Time Cure. He is also the founder and president of the Heroic Imagination Project.\nThe Stanford prison experiment was a study of the  psychological  effects of becoming a  prisoner  or  prison guard . The experiment was conducted at  Stanford University  on August 14\u201320, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  using college students. It was funded by the  U.S. Office of Naval Research  and was of interest to both the  U.S. Navy  and  Marine Corps  as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners.  The experiment is a classic study on the psychology of imprisonment and is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.\nThe Experiment is a 2010 American  drama   thriller  film directed by  Paul T. Scheuring  and starring  Adrien Brody ,  Forest Whitaker ,  Cam Gigandet ,  Clifton Collins, Jr. , and  Maggie Grace , about an experiment which resembles  Philip Zimbardo 's  Stanford prison experiment  in 1971.\nZimbardo aborted the experiment early when  Christina Maslach , a graduate student in psychology whom he was dating (and later married), objected to the conditions of the prison after she was introduced to the experiment to conduct interviews. Zimbardo noted that, of more than 50 people who had observed the experiment, Maslach was the only one who questioned its morality. After only six days of a planned two weeks' duration, the Stanford prison experiment was discontinued.\nThe other classical study on obedience was conducted at  Stanford University  during the 1970s.  Phillip Zimbardo  was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the  Stanford Prison Experiment , college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of \"social forces\" on participants behavior. Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using  random assignment  half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing \"a psychological state of imprisonment\".\nNow a more widely recognized study since the publication of his book, The Lucifer Effect, the  Stanford Prison Experiment  is infamous for its blatant display of  aggression  in deindividuated situations. Zimbardo created a mock prison environment in the basement of  Stanford University \u2019s psychology building in which he  randomly assigned  24 men to undertake the role of either guard or prisoner. These men were specifically chosen because they had no abnormal personality traits (e.g.:  narcissistic ,  authoritarian ,  antisocial , etc.) The experiment, originally planned to span over two weeks, ended after only six days because of the sadistic treatment of the prisoners by the guards. Zimbardo attributed this behavior to deindividuation due to immersion within the group and creation of a strong  group dynamic . Several elements added to the deindividuation of both guards and prisoners. Prisoners were made to dress alike, wearing stocking caps and hospital dressing gowns, and also were identified only by a number assigned to them rather than by their name. Guards were also given uniforms and reflective glasses which hid their faces. The dress of guards and prisoners led to a type of  anonymity  on both sides because the individual identifying characteristics of the men were taken out of the equation. Additionally, the guards had the added element of  diffusion of responsibility  which gave them the opportunity to remove personal responsibility and place it on a higher power. Several guards commented that they all believed that someone else would have stopped them if they were truly crossing the line, so they continued with their behavior. Zimbardo's prison study would have not been stopped if one of Zimbardo's graduate students, Christina Maslach, had not pointed it out to him.\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) was a study of the  psychological  effects of perceived power. Specifically, the study focused on the power struggle between  prisoner s and  prison guard s. The experiment was conducted at  Stanford University  on August 14\u201320, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  using college students. It was funded by the  U.S. Office of Naval Research  and was of interest to both the  U.S. Navy  and  Marine Corps  as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners.  The experiment is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.\nPerhaps most damning to the traditional view of character are the results of the experiments conducted by  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s and  Philip G. Zimbardo  in 1971. In the first of these experiments, the great majority of subjects, when politely though firmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what they thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming \"victim.\" In the second, the infamous  Stanford prison experiment , the planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life had to be ended after only six days because the college students who were assigned to act as guards became sadistic and those who were the \"prisoners\" became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. These and other experiments are taken to show that if humans do have noble tendencies, they are narrow, \"local\" traits that are not unified with other traits into a wider behavioral pattern of being.\nThe genesis of the programme was the 1971  Stanford prison experiment  carried out by  Philip Zimbardo  at  Stanford University , in which a group of students were recruited to perform the roles of 'prisoner' and 'guard' as a psychological experiment to test how human beings conform to roles. That study was brought to a premature end as a result of the extreme brutality displayed by guards towards prisoners.\nStanford University  psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  conducts a  psychological experiment  to test the hypothesis that the personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior between them. In the experiment, Zimbardo selects fifteen male students to participate in a 14-day prison simulation to take roles as prisoners or guards. They receive $15 per day. The experiment is conducted in a mock prison located in the basement of Jordan Hall, the university's psychology department building. The students who are guards become abusive, as does Zimbardo himself. Two students who play the role of prisoners quit the experiment early, and Zimbardo abruptly stops the entire experiment after only six days.\nIn the summer of 1971 a Stanford psychology professor,  Philip Zimbardo , conducted a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard which is known as the  Stanford prison experiment . The experiment, which was funded by the  Office of Naval Research , surprised the professor by the authoritarian and brutal reaction of the \"guards\" and the passive acceptance of abuse by the \"prisoners\". The experiment was criticized as unethical and was a partial cause of the development of ethical guidelines for experiments involving human subjects.\nThe plot tells the story of the  Stanford prison experiment  in which students play the role of a prisoner or a prison guard conducted at  Stanford University  under supervision of psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  in 1971.\nIn 1971,  Stanford University   psychologist   Philip Zimbardo  conducted the  Stanford prison experiment  in which twenty-four male students were randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. The participants adapted to their roles beyond Zimbardo's expectations with prison guards exhibiting  authoritarian  status and psychologically abusing the prisoners who were passive in their acceptance of the abuse. The experiment was largely controversial with criticisms aimed toward the lack of scientific principles and a control group, and for ethical concerns regarding Zimbardo's lack of intervention in the prisoner abuse.\nA study of prisoners and guards in a simulated prison.
