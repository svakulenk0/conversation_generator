{"version": "squash-2.0", "data": [{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Callorhinchidae (sometimes spelled \"Callorhynchidae\"), or plough-nose chimaeras, are a family of marine fish containing one genus, Callorhinchus. They are similar in form and habits to other  chimaera s, but are distinguished by the presence of an elongated, flexible, fleshy snout, with a vague resemblance to a ploughshare. The snout is used to probe the sea bottom in search of the invertebrates and small fishes on which it preys. The remainder of the body is flat and compressed, often described as elongated. The mouth is just under this snout and the eyes are located high on top of the head. The usual color is black or brown, and, often a mixture between the two.  Phylogenetically, they are the oldest group of living jawed  Chondrichthyes. They possess the same  cartilaginous  skeleton seen in sharks but are considered  holocephali  to distinguish them from the shark and ray categorization. Because of this, they provide a useful research organism for studying the early development of the jawed characteristic. Among the Chondrichthyes  genome, Callorhinchus has the smallest genome. Because of this, it has been proposed to be used for entire  genome sequencing  to represent the cartilaginous fish class. They are considered to resemble a cross between a shark and a ray or skate, but can be distinguished from sharks because they possess an  operculum  over their gill slits. Additionally, their skin is smooth, not covered in tough scales, characteristic of the shark. While the shark's jaw is loosely attached to the skull, the Callorhinchidae family differ in that their jaws are fused to their skulls. Many classify the Callorhinchidae as a chimeric species due to their shared characteristics of both the sharks and rays. They are found in muddy and sandy substrates of the ocean bottom, where they filter feed, with small shellfish making up the bulk of their diet. They have broad flat teeth that have adapted for this type of eating habit, two pair that reside in the upper jaw and one pair in the lower jaw.  In addition to its utilization for feeding, the trunk of the Callorhinchus fish can sense movement and electric fields, allowing them to locate their prey.  They possess large pectoral fins, believed to aid in moving swiftly through the water. They also have two dorsal fins spaced widely apart, which help identify the species in the open ocean.", "qas": [{"id": "question_0", "question": "What are the Callorhinchidae?", "answers": [{"text": "The Callorhinchidae (sometimes spelled \"Callorhynchidae\"), or plough-nose chimaeras, are a family of marine fish containing one genus, Callorhinchus.", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1", "question": "What are the Callorhinchidae family like?", "answers": [{"text": "They are similar in form and habits to other  ", "answer_start": 150}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_2", "question": "What do they look like?", "answers": [{"text": "chimaera s, but are distinguished by the presence of an elongated, flexible, fleshy snout, with a vague resemblance to a ploughshare.", "answer_start": 196}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_3", "question": "What is the snout used for?", "answers": [{"text": "The snout is used to probe the sea bottom in search of the invertebrates and small fishes on which it preys.", "answer_start": 330}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_4", "question": "How are the teeth described?", "answers": [{"text": "The remainder of the body is flat and compressed, often described as elongated.", "answer_start": 439}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_5", "question": "What is on the head of the Callorhinchus?", "answers": [{"text": "The mouth is just under this snout and the eyes are located high on top of the head.", "answer_start": 519}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_6", "question": "what is the usual color of the Callorhinchidae?", "answers": [{"text": "The usual color is black or brown, and, often a mixture between the two.

vacation home on a private lake. There, Sara encounters her old boyfriend, Dennis, and his friend Red. Nick, Blake, Malik and Maya go wake-boarding when a shark attacks Malik. He is able to swim back to shore \u2013 missing his right arm. When Nick swims into the lake to retrieve Malik's arm, he is pursued by the shark, barely making it to shore. Being a pre-med student, he stabilizes Malik, and they all take him to the hospital. Blood from Malik's wound attracts a shark that attacks the boat. Maya (Malik's girlfriend who he was about to propose to) is knocked into the water and eaten. The shark damages the steering column of the boat, causing it to crash in front of the boathouse. Sara, Nick and Malik make it to shore. Dennis and Red arrive and agree to take Beth and Gordon to the mainland. During the boat trip, Dennis reveals that he and Red put the sharks in the lake and feed college students to them. Dennis forces Gordon into the water by shooting him; he swims to a  mangrove  tree but is devoured by a  bull shark. Red and Dennis force Beth to strip down and feed her to  cookiecutter shark s. Malik arms himself with a harpoon and ventures into the water to kill the shark that killed Maya. His wound attracts a  hammerhead shark ; he kills it but is further wounded. Nick and Blake pull the shark to shore, and Nick finds a camera attached to its belly. Blake decides to take Malik to the mainland on a jet ski. When they are pursued by sharks, Malik sacrifices himself and later Blake is killed by a  great white shark. Sheriff Sabin visits Sara and Nick and gives them soup, which makes Nick and Sara's dog, who has also eaten the soup, pass out. Sara hears Dennis and Red speaking from Sabin's radio, describing Beth's death. Dennis and Red then appear and take Sara to their boat, while Sabin prepares to dunk Nick into the lake, where  sand tiger shark s wait. Sabin reveals that he, Dennis and Red have been inspired by the  Discovery Channel's  Shark Week  and  Faces of Death  videos to film people being eaten by sharks. Nick is able to break free and ignite a can of gas. Badly burned, Sabin plunges into the lake and is eaten by a sand shark. Dennis reveals the reason why he is bitter at Sara: three years ago, while they were dating Sara had to go off to college and she and Dennis had a farewell swim at their favorite diving spot. The day is ruined when Sara almost drowns and Dennis, who is angry with her for having to leave him, refuses to help her. As revenge she runs him over with a jet ski, damaging half his face. Red throws her dog into the water and soon after Dennis calls up Carl, the man from the bait shop, telling him to release another great white shark, Dennis and Red lower her into the lake in a shark cage. As Dennis is about to release her, Nick arrives and takes Red hostage.

As top predators in most marine environments,  shark s show strong IGP interactions, both between species of sharks and with other top predators like  toothed whales.  In tropical areas where multiple species of sharks may have significantly overlapping diets, the risk of injury or predation can determine the local range and available prey resources for different species.  Large pelagic species such as  blue  and  mako  sharks are rarely observed feeding in the same areas as  great white shark s, and the presence of white sharks will prevent other species from scavenging on whale carcasses.  Intraguild predation between sharks and toothed whales usually involves large sharks preying upon  dolphin s and  porpoise s while also competing with them for fish prey, but  orca s reverse this trend by preying upon large sharks while competing for large fish and  seal  prey. Intraguild predation can occur in freshwater systems as well.
