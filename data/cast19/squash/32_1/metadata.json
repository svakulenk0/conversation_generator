{"input_text": "The Callorhinchidae (sometimes spelled \"Callorhynchidae\"), or plough-nose chimaeras, are a family of marine fish containing one genus, Callorhinchus. They are similar in form and habits to other  chimaera s, but are distinguished by the presence of an elongated, flexible, fleshy snout, with a vague resemblance to a ploughshare. The snout is used to probe the sea bottom in search of the invertebrates and small fishes on which it preys. The remainder of the body is flat and compressed, often described as elongated. The mouth is just under this snout and the eyes are located high on top of the head. The usual color is black or brown, and, often a mixture between the two.  Phylogenetically , they are the oldest group of living jawed  Chondrichthyes . They possess the same  cartilaginous  skeleton seen in sharks but are considered  holocephali  to distinguish them from the shark and ray categorization. Because of this, they provide a useful research organism for studying the early development of the jawed characteristic. Among the Chondrichthyes  genome , Callorhinchus has the smallest genome. Because of this, it has been proposed to be used for entire  genome sequencing  to represent the cartilaginous fish class. They are considered to resemble a cross between a shark and a ray or skate, but can be distinguished from sharks because they possess an  operculum  over their gill slits. Additionally, their skin is smooth, not covered in tough scales, characteristic of the shark. While the shark's jaw is loosely attached to the skull, the Callorhinchidae family differ in that their jaws are fused to their skulls. Many classify the Callorhinchidae as a chimeric species due to their shared characteristics of both the sharks and rays. They are found in muddy and sandy substrates of the ocean bottom, where they filter feed, with small shellfish making up the bulk of their diet. They have broad flat teeth that have adapted for this type of eating habit, two pair that reside in the upper jaw and one pair in the lower jaw.  In addition to its utilization for feeding, the trunk of the Callorhinchus fish can sense movement and electric fields, allowing them to locate their prey.  They possess large pectoral fins, believed to aid in moving swiftly through the water. They also have two dorsal fins spaced widely apart, which help identify the species in the open ocean.\nModern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago. Fossil  mackerel shark  teeth date to the  Early Cretaceous . One of the most recently evolved families is the hammerhead shark (family Sphyrnidae), which emerged in the  Eocene . The oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago, around the time of the  extinction of the dinosaurs . In early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages: one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely  serrated  teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark, and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth. These sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark,  C. megalodon . Like most extinct sharks, C. megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and  vertebrae. This giant shark reached a total length (TL) of more than . C. megalodon may have approached a maxima of  in total length and  in mass. Paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large  cetaceans .\nSeven  Tulane University  undergraduates \u2013 Sara, Nick, Beth, Malik, Maya, Blake and Gordon \u2013 drive to Sara's family vacation home on a private lake. There, Sara encounters her old boyfriend, Dennis, and his friend Red. Nick, Blake, Malik and Maya go wake-boarding when a shark attacks Malik. He is able to swim back to shore \u2013 missing his right arm. When Nick swims into the lake to retrieve Malik's arm, he is pursued by the shark, barely making it to shore. Being a pre-med student, he stabilizes Malik, and they all take him to the hospital. Blood from Malik's wound attracts a shark that attacks the boat. Maya (Malik's girlfriend who he was about to propose to) is knocked into the water and eaten. The shark damages the steering column of the boat, causing it to crash in front of the boathouse. Sara, Nick and Malik make it to shore. Dennis and Red arrive and agree to take Beth and Gordon to the mainland. During the boat trip, Dennis reveals that he and Red put the sharks in the lake and feed college students to them. Dennis forces Gordon into the water by shooting him; he swims to a  mangrove  tree but is devoured by a  bull shark . Red and Dennis force Beth to strip down and feed her to  cookiecutter shark s. Malik arms himself with a harpoon and ventures into the water to kill the shark that killed Maya. His wound attracts a  hammerhead shark ; he kills it but is further wounded. Nick and Blake pull the shark to shore, and Nick finds a camera attached to its belly. Blake decides to take Malik to the mainland on a jet ski. When they are pursued by sharks, Malik sacrifices himself and later Blake is killed by a  great white shark . Sheriff Sabin visits Sara and Nick and gives them soup, which makes Nick and Sara's dog, who has also eaten the soup, pass out. Sara hears Dennis and Red speaking from Sabin's radio, describing Beth's death. Dennis and Red then appear and take Sara to their boat, while Sabin prepares to dunk Nick into the lake, where  sand tiger shark s wait. Sabin reveals that he, Dennis and Red have been inspired by the  Discovery Channel 's  Shark Week  and  Faces of Death  videos to film people being eaten by sharks. Nick is able to break free and ignite a can of gas. Badly burned, Sabin plunges into the lake and is eaten by a sand shark. Dennis reveals the reason why he is bitter at Sara: three years ago, while they were dating Sara had to go off to college and she and Dennis had a farewell swim at their favorite diving spot. The day is ruined when Sara almost drowns and Dennis, who is angry with her for having to leave him, refuses to help her. As revenge she runs him over with a jet ski, damaging half his face. Red throws her dog into the water and soon after Dennis calls up Carl, the man from the bait shop, telling him to release another great white shark, Dennis and Red lower her into the lake in a shark cage. As Dennis is about to release her, Nick arrives and takes Red hostage. After a scuffle during which Dennis kills Red in order to catch Nick offguard, Nick shoves Dennis into the water and tries to set Sara free but Dennis appears and tries strangling him. Nick escapes as a great white shark devours Dennis. Nick kills the shark and frees Sara. Nick, Sara, and Sara's dog swim to the boat, having survived. A distance away, a great white shark breaches, signifying that sharks remain in the lake.\nThe spined pygmy shark has a wide distribution around the world. In the  Atlantic Ocean , it occurs off  Bermuda , the  United States ,  Suriname , southern  Brazil , and northern  Argentina  in the west, and off northern  France ,  Madeira ,  Cape Verde , and the  Azores  in the east. In the  Indian Ocean , this species has only been recorded off  Somalia . In the  Pacific Ocean , it is found off southern  Japan ,  Taiwan , and the  Philippines . The spined pygmy shark is found at depths of  and seldom approaches the surface, unlike the related pygmy shark and  cookiecutter shark  (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark prefers areas of high biological productivity over upper  continental and insular slope s. It may also be found over outer  shelves , but avoids central  ocean basin s. The range of this species does not overlap that of the pygmy shark, which has a similar ecology, and is also largely separate from that of the cookiecutter shark.\nIdentification of most sharks are found through a combination of tooth counts and tooth shapes. Teeth can even lead to the identification of shark species like the  requiem  shark. The fossilized records of teeth helps illustrate evolutionary history, and isolated teeth are used to study and analyze specific linear measurements of the species. In order to identify teeth and specific information about the teeth, research can be done on a shark tooth. This research may uncover many different aspects about the tooth itself, and the shark species. This proves complicated, however, due to the fact that most fossilized teeth are found mixed and scattered. To collect information on basic-life history and get dispersal estimates of a shark tooth, molecular-based technology is very efficient. To further shark population studies, collection of  mtDNA  can be extracted from shark jaws and teeth. To study the caries-reducing effect in sharks, studies are done on the  fluorine  atoms that are bound covalently to  calcium  atoms in the teeth. Each tooth has a complex  fluorapatite  structure enameloid. In order to reduce effects of deterioration in the teeth, it is useful to sample only the surface of the enameloid of the tooth for this specific research. Studying and researching shark teeth betters our understandings of shark feeding behaviors, evolutionary changes, and mechanisms. This helps us to identify the teeth, and even the species.\nA shark tooth is one of the numerous  teeth  of a  shark . A shark tooth contains resistant calcium phosphate materials. Sharks continually shed their teeth; some  Carcharhiniformes  shed approximately 35,000 teeth in a lifetime, as well as replace them by producing thousands of more. There are four basic types of shark teeth: dense flattened, needle-like, pointed lower with triangular upper, and non-functional. The type of tooth that a shark has depends on its diet and feeding habits.\nThrough 48 windows in a room decorated like  Captain Nemo 's study in the  Nautilus , Sala Nautilus is an observation room immersed in a  pool containing 700 fish of 34 different species:  sand shark s,  amberfish ,  amberjack s,  yellowtail s,  grouper s,  ocean sunfish ; there are also different kinds of sharks like  school shark s,  angel shark s,  spiny dogfish ,  hound shark s,  nursehound s and  catshark s as well as frequenters of the Galician coast like  sea bass ,  red gurnard s, immense  turbot s,  skate s and  filefish . One of the major attractions introduced on May 24, 2006 is Gast\u00f3n, a ,  male  sand shark  (Carcharias taurus) from the  Oc\u00e9anopolis  aquarium in  Brest, France . With him lives a female sand shark named  Hermosa .\nGround sharks are the largest order of sharks, and include a number of common types such as the  blue shark , catsharks, swellsharks and  sandbar shark s. Members of the orders are characterized by the presence of a  nictitating membrane  over the eye, two  dorsal fin s, an  anal fin , and five  gill  slits. The families in the order Carcharhiniformes are expected to be revised; recent  DNA  studies show that some of the traditional groups are not  monophyletic .\nVirtually every type of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on  cetacean s (including  porpoise s,  dolphin s,  beaked whale s,  sperm whale s, and  baleen whale s),  pinniped s (including  fur seal s,  leopard seal s, and  elephant seal s),  dugong s, sharks (including  blue shark s,  goblin shark s,  basking shark s,  great white shark s,  megamouth shark s and  smalltooth sand tiger shark s),  stingray s (including  deepwater stingray s,  pelagic stingray s and  sixgill stingray s), and  bony fish es (including  billfish es,  tuna s,  dolphinfish es,  jacks ,  escolar s,  opah s, and  pomfret s). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire  squid  with a  mantle  length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as  bristlemouth s,  copepod s, and other prey of more modest dimensions.\nThe Snaggletooth  shark  preys on a variety of different animals, including  bony fish , other  sharks ,  ray ,  crabs  and  cephalopods .\nBased on analyses of observer data collected from 2005 to 2009, 22 shark species were observed captured in the Marshall Islands longline tuna fishery, with 80% of the shark catch representing five species:  blue shark ( Prionace glauca ), silky shark ( Carcharhinus falciformis ), bigeye thresher shark ( Alopias superciliosus ), pelagic thresher shark (A. pelagicus) and oceanic whitetip shark ( Carcharhinus longimanus ) (Bromhead et al., 2012). Based on 2009 observer data, sharks and rays compose about 18% of total catch by weight by the Marshall Islands longline fishery.   Elasmobranch  species composition is 30% blue shark, 13% silky shark, 10% mako shark, 9% oceanic whitetip shark, and 37% other combined sharks and rays. Bromhead et al. (2012) found that in 2009, the most recent year of available observer data, the fishery had discontinued the use of fishing gear and methods known to be employed to target sharks (using large pieces of fish meat as bait, and placing baited hooks near the surface by attaching branchlines to floats), which had been employed in previous years of the study period (2005-2008).  In 2011 the Marshall Islands adopted a law that prohibits targeting sharks and prohibits the retention of sharks (see  shark sanctuary ).\nSince then, sharks have diversified into  over 500 species . They range in size from the small  dwarf lanternshark  (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only  in length, to the  whale shark  (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately  in length. Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of . They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the  bull shark  and the  river shark , which can survive and be found in both seawater and freshwater. Sharks have a covering of  dermal denticle s that protects their skin from damage and  parasite s in addition to improving their  fluid dynamics . They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.\nA  bonnethead , a type of small  hammerhead shark , was found to have produced a pup, born live on 14 December 2001 at  Henry Doorly Zoo  in Nebraska, in a tank containing three female hammerheads, but no males. The pup was thought to have been conceived through parthenogenic means. The shark pup was apparently killed by a  stingray  within days of birth. The investigation of the birth was conducted by the research team from Queen's University Belfast, Southeastern University in Florida, and Henry Doorly Zoo itself, and it was concluded after DNA testing that the reproduction was parthenogenic. The testing showed the female pup's DNA matched only one female who lived in the tank, and that no male DNA was present in the pup. The pup was not a twin or clone of her mother, but rather, contained only half of her mother's DNA (\" automictic parthenogenesis \"). This type of reproduction had been seen before in bony fish, but never in cartilaginous fish such as sharks, until this documentation.\nA powerful and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark give it an enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including  deepwater smelt s,  viperfish es,  scaly dragonfish es,  barracudina s,  greeneye s,  lanternfish es,  bristlemouth s,  cod and other gadids ,  grenadier s,  deepwater scorpionfish es,  bonito ,  snake mackerel s,  deepwater cardinalfish es, and  sea toad s), but also takes a wide variety of other animals, including  skate s, smaller sharks ( Galeus ,  Squalus ,  Etmopterus  and  Centrophorus ),  squid  and  octopus , crustaceans ( amphipod s,  isopod s,  shrimp  and  lobster s), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and  whale s. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may  scavenge , or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males are more likely to have full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.\nThe ground sharks, order Carcharhiniformes, are the largest order of  shark s. With over 270 species, carcharhiniforms include a number of common types, such as  catshark s,  swellshark s, and the  sandbar shark .\nMost sharks are  carnivorous .  Basking shark s,  whale shark s, and  megamouth shark s have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding  plankton : basking sharks practice  ram feeding , whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make  suction feeding  more efficient by using the  luminescent  tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires  gill raker s\u2014long, slender filaments that form a very efficient  sieve \u2014analogous to the  baleen  plates of the  great whale s. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.\nDuring the three weeks following the policy's implementation, 66 sharks were caught. Almost 75 per cent of the sharks caught on drum lines were under the target three metre size. Of the 49 undersized sharks, nine were found dead on the hooks and 40 were released alive. Fisheries officers patrolling beaches in Perth and a contractor in the South-West killed 17 sharks longer than three metres. Figures released on 18 February by Fisheries Minister Ken Baston showed 95 per cent of sharks caught were tiger sharks \u2013 a total of 63 animals. According to the State Government's SharkSmart website, tiger sharks \"may only have been responsible for one shark bite in WA since 1980\". Two Mako sharks have also been found dead on the drum lines.\nGarrick (1982) placed the Galapagos shark and the dusky shark at the center of the \"obscurus group\", one of two major groupings within Carcharhinus. The group consisted of the  bignose shark  (C. altimus),  Caribbean reef shark  (C. perezi),  sandbar shark  (C. plumbeus),  dusky shark  (C. obscurus), and  oceanic whitetip shark  (C. longimanus), all large, triangular-toothed sharks and is defined by the presence of a ridge between the two dorsal fins. Based on  allozyme  data, Naylor (1992) reaffirmed the integrity of this group, with the additions of the  silky shark  (C. falciformis) and the  blue shark  (Prionace glauca). The closest relatives of the Galapagos shark were found to be the dusky, oceanic whitetip, and blue sharks.\nA drum line is an unmanned aquatic trap used to lure and capture large sharks using baited hooks. They are typically deployed near popular swimming beaches with the intention of reducing the number of sharks in the vicinity and therefore the probability of shark attack. Drum lines were first deployed to protect users of the marine environment from sharks in Queensland, Australia in 1962. During this time, they were just as successful in reducing the frequency of shark attacks as the shark nets More recently, drumlines have also been used with great success in Recife, Brazil where the number of attacks has been shown to have reduced by 97% when the drumlines are deployed. While shark nets and drum lines share the same purpose, drum lines are more effective at targeting the three sharks that are considered most dangerous to swimmers: the bull shark, tiger shark and great white shark.\nAustralian  ichthyologist   Gilbert Percy Whitley  described the whiskery shark as a new genus and species, Fur macki, in a 1943 issue of the  scientific journal  Australian Zoologist. As the name Fur was already in use for the genus  Fur  of  true flies , in 1951 Whitley replaced it with Furgaleus. The  type specimen  is a  long immature male caught off  Mordialloc  in  Victoria ,  Australia . Other  common name s for the whiskery shark include Mack's whiskery shark, reef shark, shakey shark, and sundowner. Sharks from the western portion of this species' range were once thought to be a separate species, F. ventralis, until comparative studies by  Leonard Compagno  found that they were not significantly different from F. macki.\nIntraguild predation is also important in aquatic and marine ecosystems.  As top predators in most marine environments,  shark s show strong IGP interactions, both between species of sharks and with other top predators like  toothed whales .  In tropical areas where multiple species of sharks may have significantly overlapping diets, the risk of injury or predation can determine the local range and available prey resources for different species.  Large pelagic species such as  blue  and  mako  sharks are rarely observed feeding in the same areas as  great white shark s, and the presence of white sharks will prevent other species from scavenging on whale carcasses.  Intraguild predation between sharks and toothed whales usually involves large sharks preying upon  dolphin s and  porpoise s while also competing with them for fish prey, but  orca s reverse this trend by preying upon large sharks while competing for large fish and  seal  prey. Intraguild predation can occur in freshwater systems as well. For example, invertebrate predators such as insect larvae and predatory copepods and cladocerans can act as intraguild prey, with planktivorous fish the interguild predator and herbivorous zooplankton acting as the basal resource.\nThe whale shark is a  filter feeder  \u2013 one of only three known filter-feeding shark species (along with the  basking shark  and the  megamouth shark ). It feeds on  plankton  including  copepods ,  krill ,  fish eggs ,  Christmas Island red crab  larvae  and small  nekton ic life, such as small  squid  or  fish . It also feeds on clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals. The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding. Feeding occurs either by ram filtration, in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward, pushing water and food into the mouth, or by active suction feeding, in which the animal opens and closes its mouth, sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills.  In both cases, the filter pads serve to separate food from water. These unique, black sieve-like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers. Food separation in whale sharks is by  cross-flow filtration , in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface, not perpendicularly through it, before passing to the outside, while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat. This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimises fouling of the filter pad surface. Whale sharks have been observed \"coughing\", presumably to clear a build-up of particles from the filter pads. Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed.\nGreat white sharks are  carnivorous  and prey upon  fish  (e.g.  tuna ,  rays , other  shark s),  cetaceans  (i.e.,  dolphin s,  porpoise s,  whale s),  pinniped s (e.g.  seals ,  fur seal s, and  sea lion s),  sea turtle s,  sea otter s (Enhydra lutris) and  seabirds . Great whites have also been known to eat objects that they are unable to digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish including other elasmobranchs, as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of  or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species. Upon approaching a length of nearly , great white sharks begin to target predominately  marine mammal s for food, though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences. They seem to be highly opportunistic. These sharks prefer prey with a high content of energy-rich fat. Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal, a pig, and a sheep from his boat in the South  Farallons . The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.\nThe silvertip shark was originally described as Carcharias albimarginatus by German naturalist  Eduard R\u00fcppell , in the 1837 Fische des Rothen Meeres (Fishes of the Red Sea). The name was later changed to the currently valid Carcharhinus albimarginatus. The  specific epithet  is derived from the  Latin  albi meaning \"white\", and marginatus meaning \"to enclose with a border\", in reference to the distinct white fin margins. In 1960, a -long immature male caught off  Ras Muhammad  in the  Red Sea  was designated as the  type specimen . Based on similarities in  morphology , tooth shape, and  vertebra l characters, Garrick (1982) proposed the grey reef shark as the closest relative of the silvertip shark. This interpretation was corroborated by Lavery (1992), based on  allozyme  data.\nShark s inhabit all the coastal waters and estuarine habitats of Australia's coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of  requiem shark , 32 of  catshark , six of  wobbegong shark , and 40 of  dogfish shark . There are three species from the family  Heterodontidae : the  Port Jackson shark , the  zebra bullhead shark  and the  crested bullhead shark . In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked  shark attacks in Australia , of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the  bull shark , the  tiger shark  and the  great white shark . Some popular beaches in Queensland and  New South Wales  are protected by  shark net ting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. A  megamouth shark  was found on a  Perth  beach in 1988; very little is known about this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters.\nSqualus is a  genus  of  dogfish shark s in the  family   Squalidae . Commonly known as spurdogs, these  shark s are characterized by smooth  dorsal fin  spines, teeth in upper and lower  jaw s similar in size,  caudal peduncle  with lateral keels; upper precaudal pit usually present, and  caudal fin  without subterminal notch. In spurdogs, the hyomandibula (the bone connecting the braincase to the jaws) is oriented at a right angle to the  neurocranium , while in other sharks, the hyomandibula runs more parallel to the body. This led some to think that the upper jaw of Squalus would not be as protractile as the jaws of other sharks. However, a study that compared different jaw suspension types in sharks showed that this is not the case and that Squalus is quite capable of protruding its upper jaw during feeding.\nFrom the blue shark to the whale shark, what are the 20 largest sharks? Check out this list of the 20 largest sharks from Shark Week.\nThe Six gill Shark which is also known as Cow Shark is among the largest sharks of the world. It is predator and feeds on different type of animals. This large shark is found in almost all Oceans, especially in Pacific Ocean. It can be as long as 18 ft. This predator shark rarely attacks on human. Average weight is 590 kg of this type of shark.\nShark tooth. A shark tooth is one of the numerous teeth of a shark. A shark tooth contains resistant calcium phosphate materials. Sharks continually shed their teeth; some Carcharhiniformes shed approximately 35,000 teeth in a lifetime, replacing those that fall out. There are four basic types of shark teeth: dense flattened, needle-like, pointed lower with triangular upper, and non-functional. The type of tooth that a shark has depends on its diet and feeding habits. In some formations, shark's teeth are a\nLearning About Sharks Through Fossils: Consider some facts on why sharks have different types of teeth.

The Differences in Shark Teeth: Click on a type of shark and find out more about the appearance of its teeth. Shark Evolution and Fossils: Learn how shark fossils reveal how much the shark has evolved over millions of years.\nShark teeth are the most common type of fossil for a number of reasons. First, shark teeth, like most teeth, are made of dentin, a hard calcified tissue that does not easily decompose. Dentin is harder and denser than bone.In a tooth, the Dentin is surrounded by a very hard enamel shell.Secondly, to maintain a sharp smile, shark teeth are designed to regularly fall out and be replaced.dditionally, shark teeth can look different between male and female sharks of the same species, from juveniles to adults of the same species, and finally they look different if they are in the upper jaw vs. lower jaw.\nTYPES OF SHARKS. To wrap it up, let's look at some of the types of sharks we've been discussing. ANGEL SHARK: 1  flat body like a stingray -- you can tell the shark is not a ray because the pectoral fins are not attached to the head.\nThanks for visiting this Wonder of the Day\u00c2\u00ae about sharks, Madison! There are many, many different types of sharks, including Great Whites, in the oceans of the world. Because there are so many different sharks in so many different bodies of water, it would be impossible to count them all.\nAngel Sharks. One of the most unusual types of sharks our there are know as angel sharks. Many people mistake them for some other types of sea creature. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t uncommon for them to be thought of as large stingrays. But the simplest way to tell them apart is by looking at the location of the fins.\nThis information will help you identify some of the common species of sharks. There are 440 different species of sharks in the world today classified into eight different orders described below with some examples of known sharks species for each group.\nSharks are fish, they are a type of fish called chondricthyes or cartilaginous fish. This group includes Sharks, rays and a group of fish called Chimaera, none of the fish in this group have any bones, instead they have cartilage, click here to find out more about types of fish. There are 8 orders (types) of shark. We'll look at these now, in another part we'll look at their relatives and where they fit into the entire grouping of the animal kingdom. Each of the 8 orders of sharks have their own adaptations to their environment.\nThere are four different types of shark teeth. While sharks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 teeth do share the common traits described above, they have very different shapes and uses. There are four basic groups of shark diets and because of this there are four basic types of shark teeth. -Sharks that typically eat fish have long, narrow, needle-like teeth ideal for gripping something as slippery and streamlined as a fish.\nIn the wild, it is thought that their life expectancy is 30 years. The typical lifespan in the wild for Hammerhead Sharks is from 20 to 30 years approximately. Sandbar sharks or Brown sharks are considered to live between 20 and 30 years. Research made by Joung (2004) identified to be about 20 years of age.n the wild, it is thought that their life expectancy is 30 years.

Research made by Joung (2004) identified to be about 20 years of age.\nShark lifespan vary by kind. Although the majority of types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some kinds that live much longer than others. For example, the spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespan at more than 100 years, while the blue shark in the wild has an average lifespan of 15-16 years.n the wild, it is thought that their life expectancy is 30 years.

When a shark is hitting prey from underneath  they can reach up to 30mph. 12 people found this useful. Answered.\nMost people have little difficulty recognizing a shark when they see one. Yet sharks are an incredibly diverse group of fishes, and unifying them all under a single definition is not as simple as many imagine.Sharks are, of course, most famous (and infamous) for their teeth.What makes shark teeth special is that they are produced and shed serially, rotating forward as though riding on a kind of dental conveyer belt.ike most fishes, sharks have two sets of paired fins (pectoral and pelvic, corresponding to arms and legs in humans) but-unlike those of bony fishes they are supported by soft, unsegmented rays called  ceratotrichia  (used in making shark-fin soup).\nThe Six gill Shark which is also known as Cow Shark is among the largest sharks of the world. It is predator and feeds on different type of animals. This large shark is found in almost all Oceans, especially in Pacific Ocean. It can be as long as 18 ft.\nThere are more than 400 different shark species, most of which can be found in coastal regions. They are present in every ocean of the world, with some species also inhabiting rivers. Sharks belong to the class of cartilaginous fish along side rays and chimeras.While the skeleton of all other fish is made of bone, the skeleton of sharks is made of cartilage. Cartilage is lighter and more flexible than bone allowing the shark to make tight turns quickly and to stay afloat.harks are a remarkably diverse group of fish. The largest species \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the whale shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can grow up to 12 meters in length while the smallest species \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the dwarf lanternshark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only reaches a size of 17 centimeters.\nThere are more than 350 different kinds of sharks, such as the great white and whale sharks. Fossils show that sharks have been around for 420 million years, since the early Silurian. Most sharks are predators, meaning they hunt and eat fish, marine mammals, and other sea creatures. However, the largest shark eats krill, like whales. This is the whale shark, the largest fish in the world.\nSome common kinds of shark include the hammerhead shark, the great white shark, the tiger shark, and the mako shark.\nWhat is the climate of a great white shark? Do you mean what is the body temperature of a g+Great White Shark,  or what climate temperature do they prefer to live in?o you mean what is the body temperature of a g+Great White Shark,  or what climate temperature do they prefer to live in?\nThe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smallest shark is said to be the dwarf lantern shark (Etmopterus perryi). When fully grown this shark reaches a length of just 6.7 inches (17cm).The females of this species are slightly larger at 7 1/2 to 8 inches (19 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 20 cm).he shark is a type of fish with a large, long body and predominant dorsal fin. They have a full cartilaginous skeleton and most species of shark have several rows of sharp teeth.

The great hammerhead shark is the largest species of hammerhead shark and one of the few species of hammerhead shark that is potentially dangerous to humans.This is due to the sheer size of the giant hammerhead shark and also because the giant hammerhead is known to have an aggressive temperament.ammerhead sharks are commonly seen in larger groups during the summer months when the hammerhead sharks are migrating together in search of cooler waters. The great hammerhead shark is the largest species of hammerhead shark and one of the few species of hammerhead shark that is potentially dangerous to humans.\nMating and Reproduction of Sharks. Habitat Evolution Features Anatomy Senses Reproduction. Our knowledge of the many different types of reproductive strategies of sharks is still limited. This variety is precisely why it is difficult to make a certain generalization on their reproductive methods, although these are what make sharks so successful.\nThese young sharks may take several months to hatch. In certain species of sharks, the eggs stay inside the female shark for a period of time before they are laid, this allows the sharks to develop fully and spend less time in the immobile egg cases before they hatch. Types Of Sharks That Lay Eggs. Just a few species of sharks that lay eggs include: Bamboo sharks or carpet sharks. Swell sharks. Cat sharks. Horn (bullhead) sharks.\nThe outer design of sharks and bony fish is also contrasting. 1  Shark skin is covered by dermal denticles, toothlike placoid scales that are covered with enamel. 2  Shark fins are stiff and lack the fine bony spines and muscle control found in teleost. 3  Both sharks and bony fish have caudal fins, or tail fins with two lobes. The skull of a shark is made of only 10 cartilaginous elements while a bony fish skull has about 63 bones. 2  Bony fish have pleural ribs formed from dermal bone and sharks lack these ribs. 3  Unlike bony fish that have a protective bony plate covering their vulnerable gills, the gill slits of a shark are exposed and visible.\nThere are four basic types of shark teeth: dense flattened, needle-like, pointed lower with triangular upper, and non-functional. The type of tooth that a shark has depends on its diet and feeding habits. In some geological formations, shark's teeth are a common fossil.he most ancient types of sharks date back to 450 million years ago, during the Late Ordovician period, and are mostly known by their fossilised teeth. However, the most commonly found fossil shark teeth are from the Cenozoic era (the last 66 million years).\nThere are four different types of shark teeth. While sharks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 teeth do share the common traits described above, they have very different shapes and uses. There are four basic groups of shark diets and because of this there are four basic types of shark teeth.-Sharks that typically eat fish have long, narrow, needle-like teeth ideal for gripping something as slippery and streamlined as a fish.-Sharks that are benthic feeders, eating bivalves and crustaceans, have thick, plate-like teeth perfect for crushing the shells of their prey. shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teeth are arranged in rows, the number of which varies from species to species. The row nearest the front of the mouth is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cworking\u00e2\u0080\u009d row of teeth (though some sharks use up to the first 8 rows of teeth), and they are the largest teeth in a sharks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mouth.\nThere are a wide variety of shark teeth, just as there are a wide variety of sharks. These teeth can be divided into two general categories. Many shark species, such as the goblin shark and sand tiger, have very long, thin teeth.This structure is well suited for catching small fish. The shark kills the fish immediately, by piercing it with a single bite. Then it swallows the fish whole.Sharks that go after larger prey need a different strategy and a different sort of tooth. They tear into their prey several times, biting off large pieces of flesh. Sharks in this group, which includes the infamous great white shark, have wide serrated teeth.any shark species, such as the goblin shark and sand tiger, have very long, thin teeth. This structure is well suited for catching small fish. The shark kills the fish immediately, by piercing it with a single bite. Then it swallows the fish whole.\nShark teeth are also useful in conducting research about the structure of teeth, shark migration patterns, and identifying shark species. The most ancient types of sharks date back to 450 million years ago, during the Late Ordovician period, and are mostly known by their fossilised teeth.However, the most commonly found fossil shark teeth are from the Cenozoic era (the last 66 million years).he most ancient types of sharks date back to 450 million years ago, during the Late Ordovician period, and are mostly known by their fossilised teeth.

As with other species, tiger sharks in captivity do not live as extensive as in wildlife reaching only 17 to 20 years.Some experts presume that the lifespan of the Great White Sharks is approximately 30 years (Levine, 1988) but other research indicates that they can reach up to 40 years.ately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them. Shark lifespan vary by kind and it is very different for each of them. While many types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live much longer than others.\nThe typical life expectancy in the wild for Hammerhead Sharks is from 20 to 30 years approximately. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are also believed to live above 100 years, suggesting that the time to reach maturity is longer and young will take longer to born, making this type of shark more vulnerable.ately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them. Shark lifespan vary by kind and it is very different for each of them. While many types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live much longer than others.\nIn the wild, it is believed that their life expectancy is about 30 years.

Most sharks have five different types of fins, while some sharks only have four. These types of fins include: 2  Pectoral. 3  Pelvic. 4  Dorsal. 5  Anal. 6  Caudal.\nSharks have five different kinds of fins. 1  Paired pectoral fins lift the shark as it swims. 2  Paired pelvic fins stabilize the shark. 3  One or two dorsal fins also stabilize the shark. In some species, dorsal fins have spines. 4  Not all sharks have an anal fin, but it. provides stability for the sharks that do have one.\nThe anal fin is located between the pelvic and caudal fins on the bottom, or ventral, part of the shark. Caudal Fins When it comes to the shark having the ability to propel itself through the water, they utilize what is called the caudal fin. This fin, also known as the tail fin, has an upper and lower lobe that, depending on the type of shark, can vary in shape and size. The upper lobe of the caudal fin produces the majority of the shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thrusting abilities. The tail fin is one of the most important parts of the entire shark anatomy. Types Of Shark Tail Fins Because of all of these different types of fins, sharks are able to maneuver swiftly through the water while also remaining stabilized.\nThere are 440 different species of sharks in the world today classified into eight different orders described below with some examples of known sharks species for each group.", "key": "32_1", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:58.973463", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
