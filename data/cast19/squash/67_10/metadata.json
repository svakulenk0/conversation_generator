The following foods are good sources Many foods that are high in iron are recommended to be part of the diet for a person with iron deficiency anemia. The following foods are good sources of iron: red meat, egg yolks, dark leafy greens (spinach, collards), dried fruits (raisins and prunes), mollusks (clams, scallops and oysters), liver, beans, lentils, chick peas, soybeans and artichokes. Adding a variety of these foods is a good way to supplement iron in your diet.\nMost of the body's iron is found in hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues all over the body. Where to get it: There are two forms of dietary iron: heme iron (found in animal foods such as red meat, fish, and poultry) and nonheme iron (found in plant sources like lentils and beans). Chicken liver contains the most heme iron of any food, with 11 mg per serving, or 61% of your DV.\nIron rich foods: Foods such a leafy green vegetables (kale), lean red meats, beans, shellfish, nuts and fortified cereals are high in iron. The iron will be absorbed more readily if eaten with foods that contain Vitamin C such as bell peppers, parsley, broccolli, orange juice, kiwi, cooked tomatoes and strawberries.\nLessen your intake of foods that have high levels of mineral iron.

A body that lacks an adequate number of healthy red blood cells experiences a condition called anemia.\nIron deficiency can be due to a lack of iron-rich foods in the diet, such as red meat, green leafy vegetables and eggs, as well as infection, inflammation or blood loss through hemodialysis, menstruation or other causes. To treat anemia, iron levels must be known.ther ways to manage anemia. Nearly everyone with end stage renal disease (ESRD) has anemia. Before the 1990s, anemia was treated with blood transfusions. Some of the risks of transfusions included allergic reactions, iron overload and infections.\nIron is found in food in two forms, heme and non-heme iron. Heme iron, which makes up 40 percent of the iron in meat, poultry, and fish, is well absorbed. Non-heme iron, 60 percent of the iron in animal tissue and all the iron in plants (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts) is less well absorbed.Because vegan diets only contain non-heme iron, vegans should be especially aware of foods that are high in iron and techniques that can promote iron absorption.ron is found in food in two forms, heme and non-heme iron.

They contain high levels of iron. Spinach, kale, and collards are some of the best options for non-heme iron. Spinach, for instance, offers around 3.2 mg of iron in 1/2 cup. Leafy greens also offer a great variety of ways to prepare them from salads to adding them to smoothies.\nDried beans and dark green leafy vegetables are especially good sources of iron, even better on a per calorie basis than meat. Iron absorption is increased markedly by eating foods containing vitamin C along with foods containing iron. Vegetarians do not have a higher incidence of iron deficiency than do meat eaters.ortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed. Commonly eaten combinations, such as beans and tomato sauce or stir-fried tofu and broccoli, also result in generous levels of iron absorption.\nThe following foods are high in iron: 1  Meat. 2  Poultry. 3  Fish. 4  Beans. 5  Tofu. 6  Dried fruits. 7  Dark green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and chard. 8  Iron-fortified foods, such as breads and cereals.\nWhy it works: For those diagnosed with iron deficiency (a common cause of anemia, also known as low red blood cell count), getting more iron in the diet can help reduce fatigue. Red blood cells use iron to carry oxygen to the body's cells. Low iron levels can cause both physical and mental fatigue, as well as anemia. Symptoms of anemia include tiredness, lack of energy, weakness, trouble concentrating, apathy, insomnia, and loss of appetite. Spinach and other leafy greens offer a high rate of iron for an extremely low caloric intake.\nHeme vs. Non-Heme Iron. There are two forms of iron found in food: heme and non-heme. Heme iron, which is in meat, fish and poultry, is absorbed two to three times more efficiently than non-heme iron. Whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables all contain non-heme iron. To lower levels of iron, limit the heme-containing foods you eat.\nRed Meat. One of the largest groups of foods that have high amounts of iron for your body is red meats. Red meats include beef, lamb, duck and goose. Virtually every meat contains some iron that the body can use, but red meat has more iron than other meats.\nIron is found in food in two forms, heme and non-heme iron. Heme iron, which makes up 40 percent of the iron in meat, poultry, and fish, is well absorbed. Non-heme iron, 60 percent of the iron in animal tissue and all the iron in plants (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts) is less well absorbed.Because vegan diets only contain non-heme iron, vegans should be especially aware of foods that are high in iron and techniques that can promote iron absorption.ortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed.

Because vegan diets only contain non-heme iron, vegans should be especially aware of foods that are high in iron and techniques that can promote iron absorption.\nMany plant foods, including beans and spinach, contain compounds known as phytates that inhibit absorption from these sources. When you do eat vegetables containing iron, avoiding consuming coffee, tea, cocoa, calcium and high-fiber foods around the same time. These foods also inhibit absorption. Vitamin C, found in citrus fruits, cantaloupe, strawberries, leafy greens, broccoli and bell peppers, increases absorption -- so eat these veggies and fruits together with those containing iron. Iron-Rich Vegetables. Beans and legumes are veggies rich in iron. A cup of canned white beans contains 8 milligrams, 1/2 cup of lentils contains 3 milligrams and 1/2 cup of kidney beans or chickpeas contains 2 milligrams.\nPlant-based foods high in iron include beans such as soybeans, white beans and lentils, dried fruit, whole grains, dark leafy greens such as spinach, kale and collard greens, and iron fortified dried cereals and oatmeal.\n10 Foods High In Iron. 2.
