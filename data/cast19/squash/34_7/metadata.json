{"input_text": "By the  Late Bronze Age , Hittite had started losing ground to its close relative  Luwian . It appears that in the 13th century BC, Luwian was the most widely spoken language in the Hittite capital of  Hattusa . After the collapse of the Hittite Empire as a part of the more general  Late Bronze Age collapse , Luwian emerged in the Early  Iron Age  as the main language of the so-called  Syro-Hittite states  in southwestern  Anatolia  and northern  Syria .\nClimatic factors were first implicated in the Collapse as early as 1931 by Mayanists  Thomas Gann  and  J.E.S. Thompson . In The Great Maya Droughts, Richardson Gill gathers and analyzes an array of climatic, historical, hydrologic, tree ring, volcanic, geologic, lake bed, and archeological research, and demonstrates that a prolonged series of droughts probably caused the Classic Maya Collapse. The drought theory provides a comprehensive explanation, because non-environmental and cultural factors (excessive warfare, foreign invasion, peasant revolt, less trade, etc.) can all be explained by the effects of prolonged drought on Classic Maya civilization.\nBronze Age Britain  had large reserves of  tin  in  Cornwall  and  Devon , and tin is necessary to  smelt   bronze . At that time the sea level was much lower, and so tin for export could be brought across the  Solent  at low tide on carts, or possibly on boats such as those found at  Ferriby . A shortage of tin during the  Bronze Age collapse  and trade disruptions in the  Mediterranean  around 1300 BCE may have forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze.\nHowever, the Chalcolithic period ended about 2700 BC due to natural factors of ecology, with the Geok-Syur oasis getting deserted. This resulted in the migration of people to the ancient delta of the  Tedzhen River . This also lead to the Early Bronze Age Settlements at  Khapuz-depe .\nDespite the loss of territory, military weakness, and evident reduction in literacy and culture, the Kassite dynasty was the longest-lived dynasty of Babylon, lasting until 1155 BC, when Babylon was conquered by Shutruk-Nakhunte of Elam, and reconquered a few years later by the  Nebuchadnezzar I , part of the larger Late Bronze Age collapse.\nDiamond also writes about cultural factors (values), such as the apparent reluctance of the  Greenland Norse  to eat fish. Diamond also states that \"it would be absurd to claim that  environmental damage  must be a major factor in all collapses: the collapse of the  Soviet Union  is a modern counter-example, and the  destruction of Carthage  by  Rome  in 146 BC is an ancient one. It's obviously true that military or economic factors alone may suffice\".\nIn the 13th century BCE, at the end of the  Bronze Age , seafaring invaders from  Europe  and the  Aegean  known as the  Sea Peoples  entered the  Eastern Mediterranean , invading  Anatolia ,  Syria ,  Canaan ,  Cyprus  and  Egypt . The invasions by the Sea Peoples ushered the  Bronze Age Collapse , which resulted in the cultural collapse of  Mycenean Greece , the  Hittite Empire , the  New Kingdom of Egypt  and the civilizations of Canaan and Syria. The Sea Peoples are regarded as being composed of various groups of  Indo-European  peoples.\nIn the specific context of the  Middle East , a variety of factors, including population growth, soil degradation, drought, cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies, could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry (compared to arable land) to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies. In complex societies that were increasingly fragile and less resilient, the combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse.\nThe  Bronze Age  begins around 2500 BC with the first appearance of bronze objects in the archaeological record. This coincides with the appearance of the characteristic  Beaker culture ; again it is unknown whether this was brought about primarily by folk movement or by cultural assimilation, and again it may be a mixture of both. The Bronze Age sees a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual, and the rise to prominence of increasingly powerful elites, whose power was enshrined in the control of the flow of precious resources, to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects such as swords and axes, and their prowess as hunters and warriors. Settlement became increasingly permanent and intensive. Towards the end of the period, numerous examples of extremely fine metalwork begin to be found deposited in rivers, presumably for ritual reasons and perhaps reflecting a progressive shift of emphasis away from the sky and back to the earth, as a rising population increasingly put the land under greater pressure. England largely also becomes in this period bound up with the  Atlantic trade system , which created something of a cultural continuum over a large part of Western Europe. It is possible that the  Celtic languages  developed or spread to England as part of this system; by the end of the Iron Age at the very least there is ample evidence that they were spoken across the whole of England, as well as the Western parts of Britain.\nThe Mycenaean civilization started to collapse from 1200 BC. Archaeology suggests that, around 1100 BC, the palace centres and outlying settlements of the Mycenaeans' highly organized culture began to be abandoned or destroyed, and by 1050 BC, the recognizable features of Mycenaean culture had disappeared, and the population had decreased significantly. Many explanations attribute the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and the  Bronze Age collapse  to climatic or environmental catastrophe, combined with an invasion by  Dorians  or by the  Sea Peoples , or to the widespread availability of edged weapons of iron, but no single explanation fits the available  archaeological evidence .\nVarious and currently outdated theories have been proposed that postulate waves of  migration  during the  Middle Bronze Age  in the  Ancient Near East . While the turmoils that separate the Late Bronze Age from the Early Iron Age are well documented (see  Bronze Age collapse ), theories of migration during the Middle Bronze Age (20th century BCE) have little direct support.\nThe Sea Peoples  are a purported seafaring  confederation  of groups known to have attacked  ancient Egypt  prior to the  Late Bronze Age collapse . Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of  Wilhelm Max M\u00fcller : \"the most important questions of  ethnography  and the primitive history of classic nations\".\nThe  Linear B  Tablets of  Pylos  in the  Late Bronze Age  in the  Aegean  demonstrate increased slave raiding and the spread of mercenaries and migratory peoples and their subsequent resettlement. Despite this, the actual identity of the Sea Peoples has remained enigmatic and modern scholars have only the scattered records of ancient civilizations and archaeological analysis to inform them. Evidence shows that the identities and motives of these peoples were known to the Egyptians. In fact, many had sought employment with the Egyptians or were in a diplomatic relationship for a few centuries before the Late  Bronze Age Collapse . For example, select groups, or members of groups, of the Sea People, such as the Sherden or  Shardana , were used as mercenaries by Egyptian Pharaohs such as  Ramesses II .\nThe end of the Ottom\u00e1ny culture is connected with turbulent events at the end of Old Bronze Age in Central Europe, where there was a collapse of the whole \"Old Bronze Age world\" with its highly advanced culture of mighty hill-forts, rich burials, and trade over wast distances. The gradual decline in the number of fortified settlements, change of burial rites, and the decision of people to desert fortified settlements could have had several reasons, including the collapse of trade and exchange networks, the attacks of enemies, the internal collapse of society or environmental causes. The following Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age cultures are very different in their burial rites (cremation, erecting of barrows) as well as in their handling of bronze - there is an \"explosion\" in bronze working, and many bronze hoards found across all of Europe illustrate this change in quantity and quality of produced bronze objects. We see not only bronze ornaments and arms (including first examples of  sword s), but also bronze tools ( sickle s,  axe s,  adze s), which changed the everyday life of prehistoric man.\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the name given by those historians who see the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age  as violent, sudden and culturally disruptive, expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Middle East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the  Dark Age  that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite  and  Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nIncreasingly, the Iron Age in Europe is being seen as a part of the  Bronze Age collapse  in the  ancient Near East , in   ancient India  (with the post- Rigvedic   Vedic civilization ),  ancient Iran , and  ancient Greece  (with the  Greek Dark Ages ). In other regions of  Europe , the Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in  Central Europe  and the 6th century BC in  Northern Europe . The Near Eastern Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200\u20131000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous  Late Bronze Age . There is no definitive cultural break between the 13th and 12th century BC throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country,  Transjordan , and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the  Aramaean  and  Sea People  groups. There is evidence, however, that shows strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late 2nd millennium.\nPendlebury was one of the early archaeologists who engaged in environmental reconstruction of the  Bronze Age ; for example, as C. Michael Hogan notes, Pendlebury first deduced that the  settlement  at  Knossos  on  Crete  appears to have been  overpopulated  at its Bronze Age peak based upon  deforestation  practises.\nThe Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the  Cypriot  forests causing the end of the bronze trade. These forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that  charcoal  production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late Bronze Age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.\nThere is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural patterns which some scholars think may indicate an invasion (or at least a migration) into Southern Great Britain around the 12th century BC. This disruption was felt far beyond Britain, even beyond Europe, as most of the great  Near East ern empires collapsed (or experienced severe difficulties) and the  Sea Peoples  harried the entire  Mediterranean  basin around this time.  Cremation  was adopted as a burial practice, with  cemeteries  of  urns  containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record. According to  John T. Koch  and others, the Celtic languages developed during this Late Bronze Age period in an intensely trading-networked culture called the  Atlantic Bronze Age  that included  Britain, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal, but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the  Hallstatt culture .\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age , expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Near East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BCE. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite   Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BCE, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nHayasa-Azzi or Azzi-Hayasa () was a  Late Bronze Age  confederation formed between two kingdoms of  Armenian Highlands , Hayasa located South of  Trabzon  and Azzi, located north of the  Euphrates  and to the south of Hayasa. The Hayasa-Azzi confederation was in conflict with the  Hittite Empire  in the 14th century BC, leading up to the  collapse of Hatti  around 1190 BC.\nThe archaeological evidence shows a widespread  collapse of Bronze Age civilization  in the Eastern Mediterranean world at the outset of the period, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. Around then, the  Hittite  civilization suffered serious disruption and cities from  Troy  to  Gaza  were destroyed. Following the collapse, fewer and smaller settlements suggest famine and depopulation. In Greece, the  Linear B  writing of the  Greek language  used by Mycenaean bureaucrats ceased. The decoration on  Greek pottery  after about 1100 BC lacks the figurative decoration of Mycenaean ware and is restricted to simpler, generally geometric styles (1000\u2013700 BC).\nThe development of iron smelting was once attributed to the  Hittites  of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. It was believed that they maintained a monopoly on ironworking, and that their empire had been based on that advantage. Accordingly, the invading  Sea Peoples  were responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. This theory is no longer held in the common current thought of the majority of scholarship, since there is no archaeological evidence of the alleged Hittite monopoly. While there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period; and only a small number of these objects are weapons. As part of the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age, the  Bronze Age collapse  saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region. The  Ugaritic script  was in use during this time, around 1300 BC.  Ugarit  was one of the centres of the literate world.\nThe Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the  Greek Dark Ages , that lasted for more than 400 years. Other cities like  Athens  continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover. These sites in Greece show evidence of the collapse:\nDiamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbors, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and failure to adapt to  environmental issues .\nModern archaeological evidence identifies the start of large-scale iron production in around 1200 BC, marking the end of the  Bronze Age . Between 1200 BC and 1000 BC, diffusion in the understanding of iron metallurgy and use of iron objects was fast and far-flung.  Anthony Snodgrass  suggests that a shortage of tin, as a part of the  Bronze Age Collapse  and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BC, forced  metalworkers  to seek an alternative to bronze. As evidence, many bronze implements were recycled into weapons during this time. More widespread use of iron led to improved steel-making technology at lower cost. Thus, even when tin became available again, iron was cheaper, stronger, and lighter, and  forged iron implements superseded cast bronze tools permanently.\nThe Mycenaean civilization perished with the  collapse of Bronze-Age civilization  on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the  Dorian invasion , although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well. Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after  LH III C , when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the  Greek Dark Ages  of traditional historiography.\nThe growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include interruption of maritime trade by piracy by the  Sea Peoples , as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the Dorian migration or invasion.\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse was a  Dark Age  transition period in the  Aegean Region ,  Southwestern Asia  and the  Eastern Mediterranean  from the Late  Bronze Age  to the Early  Iron Age  that historians believe was violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. The  palace economy  of the Aegean Region and  Anatolia  that characterised the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the  Greek Dark Ages .\nThe collapse of the Hittite Empire is usually associated with the gradual decline of Eastern Mediterranean trade networks and the resulting  collapse of major Late Bronze Age cities  in the Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean.At the beginning of the 12th century BC,  Wilusa  ( Troy ) was destroyed and the  Hittite Empire  suffered a sudden devastating attack from the  Kaskas , who occupied the coasts around the  Black Sea , and who joined with the  Mysians . They proceeded to destroy almost all Hittite sites but  were finally defeated by the  Assyria ns beyond the southern borders near the  Tigris .   Hatti ,  Arzawa  ( Lydia ),  Alashiya  ( Cyprus ),  Ugarit  and  Alalakh  were destroyed.\nAt the end of the Bronze Age, the tin needed to make bronze could no longer be acquired With the collapse of the Bronze Age around 1200 B.C.E., trade networks fell apart. This had many consequences for Bronze Age civilizations. One of the most catastrophic was that they could no longer acquire the tin they needed to make bronze.
