{"input_text": "Social psychology often employs the experimental method in an attempt to understand human social interaction.  Social psychology conducts its experiments both inside and outside of the laboratory. One notable social psychology experiment is the  Stanford prison experiment  conducted by  Philip Zimbardo  in 1971, although the extremity of this field experiment is not prototypical of the field. Another notable study is the  Stanley Milgram  obedience experiment, often known as the  Milgram experiment .\nIn 1973, while at Stanford, Haney had the opportunity to work in support of his famed colleague, Dr.  Philip Zimbardo . Their collaboration formed what is known today as  The Stanford Prison Experiment , for which Haney served as a principal researcher.  This experience help to set in course Haney\u2019s subsequent career and work with prison systems. The simultaneously staged and real time academic drama at Stanford ingrained in Haney that.... \u201ccontext matters, prisoners are people, mistreatment has consequences\u201d. This foundation perpetuated Haney\u2019s passion regarding the psychological impact of incarceration (e.g., mental illness) and his advocacy for humanization and reform.<ref name=New York Times>\n2007.  Philip Zimbardo  (Stanford Professor, known for the  Stanford Prison Experiment )\nFormal review procedures for institutional human subject studies were originally developed in direct response to research abuses in the 20th century. Among the most notorious of these abuses were the  experiments of Nazi physicians , which became a focus of the post-World War II  Doctors' Trial , the  Tuskegee Syphilis Study , a long-term project conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the  U.S. Public Health Service , and numerous  human radiation experiments  conducted during the  Cold War .  Other controversial U.S. projects undertaken during this era include the  Milgram obedience experiment , the  Stanford prison experiment , and  Project MKULTRA , a series of classified  mind control  studies organized by the  CIA .\nP. van Lange, a  social psychologist  at the  Vrije Universiteit   Amsterdam  pointed out the similarity to the  Stanford Prison Experiment  (1971). In that experiment the participants were placed in a jail, where half played guards and the other half prisoners. In six days the experiment derailed. The guards became  aggressive ,  repressive  and  sadistic . They transformed into personalities outside their normal selves. \"From the Stanford-experiment may be concluded that human behavior is largely summoned by the local circumstances\", added his colleague J. van der Pligt, professor at the  Universiteit van Amsterdam .\"People get carried away,\" said A. Bergsma of Psychologie Magazine. \"Isolation becomes reality. They lose themselves in the experiment. There are no checks and balances. If there is no correction, they will derail one after another.\"  All experts agreed that the big reward for the winner increased the chance of accidents. But not all had a negative opinion. A. Lange, a professor of clinical psychology at the Universiteit van Amsterdam indicated that the program could produce certain insights not possible to achieve any more in socio-psychological research because the psychological well-being of the participant had been given greater importance. \"The  design  of the programme is the  wet dream  of a psychological researcher. Nowhere in the world an ethical commission will be found that would agree to such a design\", agreed psycho-physiologist A. Gaillard of the  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research .\nAccording to  Noam Chomsky , analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the  Enlightenment  era. In his 1791 book On the Limits of State Action, classical  liberal  thinker  Wilhelm von Humboldt  explained how \"whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness\" and so when the labourer works under external control, \"we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is.\" Both the  Milgram  and  Stanford experiment s have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations. Additionally, as per anthropologist  David Graeber , the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money, and the slave, another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses.) Such arrangements, according to Graeber, were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or Brazil.  C. L. R. James  argued in  The Black Jacobins  that most of the techniques of human organisation employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations.\nThe World of Abnormal Psychology is an educational video series produced by  Annenberg Media , which examines  behavioral disorder s in humans. The series is hosted by  Dr. Philip Zimbardo  of  Stanford University , who is best known for his controversial  Stanford prison experiment .\nAs per  Noam Chomsky , analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the  Enlightenment  era. In his 1791 book On the Limits of State Action, classical  liberal  thinker  Wilhelm von Humboldt  posited that \"whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness\" and so when the labourer works under external control, \"we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is.\" Both the  Milgram  and  Stanford experiment s have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.\nToday moral psychology is a thriving area of research in both philosophy and psychology, even at an  interdisciplinary  level.  For example, the psychologist  Lawrence Kohlberg  questioned boys and young men about their thought processes when they were faced with a  moral dilemma  producing one of many very useful empirical studies in the area of moral psychology. As another example, the philosopher  Joshua Knobe  recently completed an empirical study on how the way in which an ethical problem is phrased dramatically affects an individual's intuitions about the proper moral response to the problem. More conceptually focused research has been completed by researchers such as John Doris. Doris (2002) discusses the way in which  social psychological  experiments\u2014such as the  Stanford prison experiment s involving the idea of  situationism \u2014call into question a key component in  virtue ethics : the idea that individuals have a single, environment-independent moral character. As a further example,  Shaun Nichols  (2004) examines how empirical data on psychopathology suggests that  moral rationalism  is false.\nThe Stanford prison experiment was a study of the  psychological  effects of becoming a  prisoner  or  prison guard . The experiment was conducted at  Stanford University  on August 14\u201320, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  using college students. It was funded by the  U.S. Office of Naval Research  and was of interest to both the  U.S. Navy  and  Marine Corps  as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners.  The experiment is a classic study on the psychology of imprisonment and is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.\nThe Stanford prison experiment was in part a response to the  Milgram experiment  at Yale beginning in 1961 and published in 1963.\nMaslach graduated from  Radcliffe College  (1967) and earned a  Ph.D.  in Psychology at  Stanford University  (1971). Her evaluation of the  Stanford Prison Experiment  persuaded the investigator, her then future husband  Philip Zimbardo , to stop the experiment after only six days. In 1988\u201389, she was President of the Western Psychological Association; and, since 2001, she has been Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education at the  University of California, Berkeley .\nAlso, researchers from  Western Kentucky University  argued that  selection bias  may have played a role in the results. The researchers recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying \"a psychological study\" (the control group), and some with the words \"prison life\" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the \"prison study\" were higher in traits such as  social dominance ,  aggression ,  authoritarianism , etc. and were lower in traits related to  empathy  and  altruism  when statistically compared to the control group participants.\nWhile Haslam and Reicher's procedure was not a direct replication of Zimbardo's, their study casts further doubt on the generality of his conclusions. Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly into role and the idea that the dynamics of evil are in any way banal. Their research also points to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment.\nReicher collaborated with Professor  Alex Haslam  of the  University of Exeter  on the  BBC  television programme  The Experiment , which examined conflict, order, rebellion and tyranny in the behaviour of a group of individuals held in a simulated prison environment. The experiment (which became known as the BBC Prison Study) re-examined issues raised by the  Stanford Prison Experiment  (SPE) and led to a number of publications in leading psychology journals. Amongst other things, these challenged the role account of tyranny associated with the SPE as well as broader ideas surrounding the  Banality of evil , and advanced a social identity-based understanding of the dynamics of resistance.\nPsychologists  Alex Haslam  and  Steve Reicher  conducted the BBC Prison Study in 2002 and was published in 2006. This was a partial replication of the Stanford prison experiment conducted with the assistance of the  BBC , which broadcast events in the study in a documentary series called  The Experiment . Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny,  stress , and leadership. The results were published in leading academic journals such as  British Journal of Social Psychology ,  Journal of Applied Psychology ,  Social Psychology Quarterly , and  Personality and Social Psychology Review . The BBC Prison Study is now taught as a core study on the UK  A-level   Psychology  OCR syllabus.\nThe other classical study on obedience was conducted at  Stanford University  during the 1970s.  Phillip Zimbardo  was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the  Stanford Prison Experiment , college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of \"social forces\" on participants behavior. Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using  random assignment  half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing \"a psychological state of imprisonment\".\nNow a more widely recognized study since the publication of his book, The Lucifer Effect, the  Stanford Prison Experiment  is infamous for its blatant display of  aggression  in deindividuated situations. Zimbardo created a mock prison environment in the basement of  Stanford University \u2019s psychology building in which he  randomly assigned  24 men to undertake the role of either guard or prisoner. These men were specifically chosen because they had no abnormal personality traits (e.g.:  narcissistic ,  authoritarian ,  antisocial , etc.) The experiment, originally planned to span over two weeks, ended after only six days because of the sadistic treatment of the prisoners by the guards. Zimbardo attributed this behavior to deindividuation due to immersion within the group and creation of a strong  group dynamic . Several elements added to the deindividuation of both guards and prisoners. Prisoners were made to dress alike, wearing stocking caps and hospital dressing gowns, and also were identified only by a number assigned to them rather than by their name. Guards were also given uniforms and reflective glasses which hid their faces. The dress of guards and prisoners led to a type of  anonymity  on both sides because the individual identifying characteristics of the men were taken out of the equation. Additionally, the guards had the added element of  diffusion of responsibility  which gave them the opportunity to remove personal responsibility and place it on a higher power. Several guards commented that they all believed that someone else would have stopped them if they were truly crossing the line, so they continued with their behavior. Zimbardo's prison study would have not been stopped if one of Zimbardo's graduate students, Christina Maslach, had not pointed it out to him.\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) was a study of the  psychological  effects of perceived power. Specifically, the study focused on the power struggle between  prisoner s and  prison guard s. The experiment was conducted at  Stanford University  on August 14\u201320, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  using college students. It was funded by the  U.S. Office of Naval Research  and was of interest to both the  U.S. Navy  and  Marine Corps  as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners.  The experiment is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.\nBoth the Milgram and Stanford experiments were conducted in experimental circumstances. In 1966, psychiatrist Charles K. Hofling published the results of a  field experiment  on obedience in the nurse\u2013physician relationship in its natural hospital setting. Nurses, unaware they were taking part in an experiment, were ordered by unknown doctors to administer dangerous doses of a (fictional) drug to their patients. Although several hospital rules disallowed administering the drug under the circumstances, 21 out of the 22 nurses would have given the patient an overdose of medicine.\nPerhaps most damning to the traditional view of character are the results of the experiments conducted by  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s and  Philip G. Zimbardo  in 1971. In the first of these experiments, the great majority of subjects, when politely though firmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what they thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming \"victim.\" In the second, the infamous  Stanford prison experiment , the planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life had to be ended after only six days because the college students who were assigned to act as guards became sadistic and those who were the \"prisoners\" became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. These and other experiments are taken to show that if humans do have noble tendencies, they are narrow, \"local\" traits that are not unified with other traits into a wider behavioral pattern of being.\nThe genesis of the programme was the 1971  Stanford prison experiment  carried out by  Philip Zimbardo  at  Stanford University , in which a group of students were recruited to perform the roles of 'prisoner' and 'guard' as a psychological experiment to test how human beings conform to roles. That study was brought to a premature end as a result of the extreme brutality displayed by guards towards prisoners.\nHis novel Black Box (1999), which is based on a true occurrence ( Stanford prison experiment ) was adapted to a film under the name  Das Experiment  directed by  Oliver Hirschbiegel . The film was acclaimed and Giordano received for it among other prizes the  Bavarian Film Award  for Best Screenplay.\nIn  The Journal of the American Medical Association ,  Zimbardo's situational perspective received support from other social situational experiments that demonstrated the same idea and concept. Almost ten years prior to the Stanford Prison Experiment (1971),  Stanley Milgram  conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had \"teachers\" that delivered mock electric shocks to the \"learner\" for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20\u201350 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a \"confederate\" that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, \"I advise you to continue with this experiment\" or \"I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks\" and the one that caught most teachers was \"You must continue with the shocks.\" Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.\nStanford University  psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  conducts a  psychological experiment  to test the hypothesis that the personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior between them. In the experiment, Zimbardo selects fifteen male students to participate in a 14-day prison simulation to take roles as prisoners or guards. They receive $15 per day. The experiment is conducted in a mock prison located in the basement of Jordan Hall, the university's psychology department building. The students who are guards become abusive, as does Zimbardo himself. Two students who play the role of prisoners quit the experiment early, and Zimbardo abruptly stops the entire experiment after only six days.\nIn the summer of 1971 a Stanford psychology professor,  Philip Zimbardo , conducted a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard which is known as the  Stanford prison experiment . The experiment, which was funded by the  Office of Naval Research , surprised the professor by the authoritarian and brutal reaction of the \"guards\" and the passive acceptance of abuse by the \"prisoners\". The experiment was criticized as unethical and was a partial cause of the development of ethical guidelines for experiments involving human subjects.\nThe plot tells the story of the  Stanford prison experiment  in which students play the role of a prisoner or a prison guard conducted at  Stanford University  under supervision of psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  in 1971.\nIn 1971,  Stanford University   psychologist   Philip Zimbardo  conducted the  Stanford prison experiment  in which twenty-four male students were randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. The participants adapted to their roles beyond Zimbardo's expectations with prison guards exhibiting  authoritarian  status and psychologically abusing the prisoners who were passive in their acceptance of the abuse. The experiment was largely controversial with criticisms aimed toward the lack of scientific principles and a control group, and for ethical concerns regarding Zimbardo's lack of intervention in the prisoner abuse.\nZimbardo (1973) had intended that the experiment should run for a fortnight, but on the sixth day it was terminated. Christina Maslach, a recent Stanford Ph.D. brought in to conduct interviews with the guards and prisoners, strongly objected when she saw the prisoners being abused by the guards.\nA study of prisoners and guards in a simulated prison.
