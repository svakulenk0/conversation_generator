{"input_text": "Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a disorder characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), movement problems, increased susceptibility to infection, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function. The anemia in this condition begins in infancy. Since the anemia results from the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic anemia. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. When the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. The movement problems are caused by impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. This impairment leads to muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), tremors, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Affected individuals may also develop seizures. Weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. Individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells. These immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The most common infections in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. People with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often do not survive past childhood due to respiratory failure. In a few rare cases, affected individuals without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood. The deficiency is most commonly caused by mutations in TPI1, although mutations in other isoforms have been identified. A common marker for TPI deficiency is the increased accumulation of DHAP in erythrocyte extracts; this is because the defective enzyme no longer has the ability to catalyze the isomerization to GAP. The point mutation does not affect the catalysis rate, but rather, affects the assembly of the enzyme into a homodimer.\nA megaloblast is an unusually large erythroblast that can be associated with  vitamin B  deficiency (caused by  pernicious anemia  or  dietary insufficiency ),  folic acid deficiency , or both (such  anemia s are collectively called  megaloblastic anemia s). This kind of anemia leads to macrocytes (abnormally large red cells) and the condition called  macrocytosis . The cause of this cellular gigantism is an impairment in  DNA replication  that delays nuclear maturation and  cell division . Because  RNA  and  cytoplasm ic elements are synthesized at a constant rate despite the cells' impaired DNA synthesis, the cells show nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony.\nThe most common causes of  microcytic anemia  are iron deficiency (due to inadequate  diet ary intake,  gastrointestinal blood loss , or  menstrual blood loss ),  thalassemia ,  sideroblastic anemia  or  chronic disease . In  iron deficiency anemia  (microcytic anemia), it can be as low as 60 to 70 femtolitres. In some cases of  thalassemia , the MCV may be low even though the patient is not iron deficient.\nAnemia  in cancer patients can be a combined outcome caused by myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and possible cancer-related causes such as  bleeding ,  blood cell  destruction ( hemolysis ), hereditary disease, kidney dysfunction, nutritionaldeficiencies and/or  anemia of chronic disease . Treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production ( erythropoietin ),  iron supplement s, and  blood transfusion s. Myelosuppressive therapy can cause a tendency to bleed easily, leading to anemia. Medications that kill rapidly dividing cells or blood cells can reduce the number of  platelet s in the blood, which can result in  bruises  and  bleeding . Extremely low platelet counts may be temporarily boosted through  platelet transfusion s and new drugs to increase platelet counts during chemotherapy are being developed. Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed to allow platelet counts to recover.\nAbnormally low numbers of reticulocytes can be attributed to  chemotherapy ,  aplastic anemia ,  pernicious anemia , bone marrow malignancies, problems of  erythropoietin  production, various vitamin or mineral deficiencies ( iron ,  vitamin B ,  folic acid ), disease states ( anemia of chronic disease ) and other causes of anemia due to poor RBC production.\nThe causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell (RBC) production, increased RBC destruction ( hemolytic anemia s), blood loss and fluid overload ( hypervolemia ). Several of these may interplay to cause anemia eventually. Indeed, the most common cause of anemia is blood loss, but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired RBC production develops, in turn most commonly by  iron deficiency . (See  Iron deficiency anemia )\nVitamin B1 deficiency  ( thiamin  deficiency) can cause glossitis.  Vitamin B2 deficiency  (ariboflavinosis) can cause glossitis, along with  angular cheilitis ,  cheilosis ,  peripheral neuropathy  and other signs and symptoms. The glossitis in vitamin B2 deficiency is described as  magenta .   Vitamin B3 deficiency  (pellagra) can cause glossitis.  Vitamin B6 deficiency  ( pyridoxine  deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with  angular cheilitis, cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and  seborrheic dermatitis .  Folate deficiency  (vitamin B9 deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with macrocytic anemia,  thrombocytopenia ,  leukopenia ,  diarrhea ,  fatigue  and possibly  neurological  signs. Apart from pernicious anemia discussed above, any other cause of vitamin B12 deficiency can cause glossitis, which tends to be painful, smooth and shiny.\nEither hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia, or both, may cause anemia. Some well-known hemoglobin variants such as  sickle-cell anemia  and  congenital dyserythropoietic anemia  are responsible for diseases, and are considered hemoglobinopathies. However, many  hemoglobin variants  do not cause pathology or anemia, and thus are often not classed as hemoglobinopathies, because they are not considered pathologies.  Hemoglobin variants  are a part of the normal  embryonic  and  fetal  development, but may also be pathologic mutant forms of hemoglobin in a  population , caused by variations in genetics. Other variants cause no detectable  pathology , and are thus considered non-pathological variants.\nThere are three main types of anemia: that due to  blood loss , that due to decreased red blood cell production and that due to increased red blood cell breakdown. Causes of blood loss include  trauma  and  gastrointestinal bleeding , among others. Causes of decreased production include  iron deficiency , a  lack of vitamin B12 ,  thalassemia , and a number of  neoplasms of the bone marrow . Causes of increased breakdown include a number of genetic conditions such as  sickle cell anemia , infections like  malaria , and certain autoimmune diseases. It can also be classified based on the  size of red blood cells  and  amount of hemoglobin in each cell . If the cells are small, it is  microcytic anemia . If they are large, it is  macrocytic anemia  while if they are normal sized, it is  normocytic anemia . Diagnosis in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL), while in women, it must be less than 120 to 130 g/L (12 to 13 g/dL), Further testing is then required to determine the cause.\nDiamond\u2013Blackfan anemia (DBA), also known as Blackfan-Diamond anemia, inherited pure red cell aplasia and as inherited erythroblastopenia, is a  congenital   erythroid   aplasia  that usually presents in  infancy . DBA causes low  red blood cell  counts ( anemia ), without substantially affecting the other blood components (the  platelet s and the  white blood cell s), which are usually normal. This is in contrast to  Shwachman\u2013Bodian\u2013Diamond syndrome , in which the  bone marrow  defect results primarily in  neutropenia , and  Fanconi anemia , where all cell lines are affected resulting in  pancytopenia .\nIn  medicine  ( hematology ) microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) is a  microangiopathic  subgroup of  hemolytic anemia  (loss of red blood cells through destruction) caused by factors in the small blood vessels. It is identified by the finding of anemia and  schistocytes  on  microscopy  of the  blood film .\nDecrease of hemoglobin, with or without an absolute decrease of red blood cells, leads to symptoms of  anemia . Anemia has many different causes, although  iron deficiency  and its resultant  iron deficiency anemia  are the most common causes in the Western world. As absence of iron decreases heme synthesis, red blood cells in iron deficiency anemia are hypochromic (lacking the red hemoglobin pigment) and microcytic (smaller than normal). Other anemias are rarer. In  hemolysis  (accelerated breakdown of red blood cells), associated  jaundice  is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin, and the circulating hemoglobin can cause  renal failure .\nIron-deficiency anemia, also spelled iron-deficiency anaemia, is  anemia  caused by a  lack of iron . Anemia is defined as a decrease in the amount of  red blood cell s (RBCs) or  hemoglobin  in the  blood . When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include  feeling tired , weakness,  shortness of breath  or poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms which may include:  confusion ,  feeling like one is going to pass out , and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably  pale . There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause.\nHowell\u2013Jolly bodies are seen with markedly decreased splenic function. Common causes include asplenia (post-splenectomy). Spleen also is removed for therapeutic purposes in conditions like  hereditary spherocytosis , trauma to the spleen, and  autosplenectomy  caused by  sickle cell anemia . Other causes are  radiation therapy  involving the spleen, such as that used to treat  Hodgkin lymphoma .  Howell\u2013Jolly bodies are also seen in:  amyloidosis , severe  hemolytic anemia ,  megaloblastic anemia , hereditary spherocytosis,  heterotaxy  with asplenia and  myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS). Also can be seen in premature infants.\nAnemia goes undetected in many people and symptoms can be minor. The symptoms can be related to an underlying cause or the anemia itself.Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of  weakness  or  tired , and sometimes poor concentration. They may also report  shortness of breath  on exertion.  In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing  cardiac output .  The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as  palpitation s,  angina  (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent  claudication  of the legs, and symptoms of  heart failure .On examination, the signs exhibited may include  pallor  ( pale   skin , lining  mucosa ,  conjunctiva  and  nail beds ), but this is not a reliable sign.  There may be signs of specific causes of anemia, e.g.,  koilonychia  (in iron deficiency),  jaundice  (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells \u2014 in hemolytic anemia), bone deformities (found in  thalassemia  major) or  leg   ulcers  (seen in  sickle-cell disease ).In severe anemia, there may be signs of a  hyperdynamic circulation :  tachycardia  (a fast heart rate),  bounding pulse ,  flow murmurs , and  cardiac   ventricular hypertrophy  (enlargement).  There may be signs of  heart failure . Pica , the consumption of non-food items such as ice, but also paper, wax, or grass, and even hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency, although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of  hemoglobin .Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced academic performance in children of school age.  Restless legs syndrome  is more common in those with  iron-deficiency anemia .\nRiboflavin deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in  stomatitis  including painful red tongue with sore throat, chapped and fissured lips (cheilosis), and inflammation of the corners of the mouth ( angular stomatitis ).  There can be oily scaly skin rashes on the  scrotum ,  vulva ,  philtrum  of the lip, or the  nasolabial fold s.  The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot and sensitive to light.  Due to interference with iron absorption, even mild to moderate riboflavin deficiency results in an  anemia  with normal cell size and normal  hemoglobin  content (i.e. normochromic normocytic  anemia ).  This is distinct from anemia caused by deficiency of  folic acid  (B) or  cyanocobalamin  (B), which causes anemia with large blood cells ( megaloblastic anemia ). Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in birth defects including congenital heart defects and limb deformities.\nJeff, a well-known cyclist, is cycling in a non-profitable charity race, when he is unable to breathe and taken to the hospital. House finds it surprising that Jeff admitted he is taking illegal enhancement drugs. He agreed to blood doping, which is common among cyclists, to better one's athletic performance. Because red blood cells carry oxygen between the lungs and the muscles, a higher number of red blood cells can increase an athlete\u2019s endurance. While trying to figure out what cause of Jeff\u2019s respiratory distress, they find an embolus in his chest. While Dr. Chase works to remove the air bubble, Jeff begins to feel numbness in his legs, but is told that it might be due to the sedation. While his manager talks to the press, Jeff loses feeling in his legs. Dr. Cameron informs House that Jeff\u2019s red blood count is continually dropping, revealing that his body is no longer able to produce red blood cells on its own. House becomes convinced that Jeff might have lied about a specific drug that could be the cause of all of his symptoms, Erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced in the kidney that promotes the formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Adding more blood cells increases the oxygen level in the blood, thus presumably causing all of Jeff's symptoms as he fails to produce red blood cells on his own. Which is explanation for him also having anemia, caused by a chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), probably resulting from his use of blood doping. After responding to a Prednisone treatment, Jeff began losing more red blood cells to the point of requiring a transfusion. House scans Jeff's neck and a Thymoma is discovered; an extremely rare tumor on the thymus, confirming that he wasn\u2019t taking EPO, but he did have Chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia. Due to the diagnosis he can legally blood dope, or get a Thymectomy which could only bring him into a temporary remission, and then after he would have to be on medical steroids.\nMany medical conditions cause anemia. Common causes of anemia include the following: 1  Anemia from active bleeding: Loss of blood through heavy menstrual bleeding or wounds can cause anemia. 2  Gastrointestinal ulcers or cancers such as cancer of the colon may slowly ooze blood and can also cause anemia.\nBlood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion. Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells. Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.\nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death.\nSome diseases of the red blood cells are inherited. Diseases of the red blood cells include many types of anemia, a condition in which your body can't produce enough normal red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen throughout the body.People with anemia may have red blood cells that have an unusual shape or that look normal, larger than normal, or smaller than normal.ed blood cells at work. Hemoglobin is the protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide from your body, transporting it to the lungs for you to exhale. Red blood cells are made inside your bones, in the bone marrow.\nHemolytic anemia. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Hemolytic anemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular).It has numerous possible causes, ranging from relatively harmless to life-threatening.emolytic anemia.

Bleeding and anemia from poisoning. Bruising, nosebleeds, blood in the stool, and anemia are caused by rat and mouse poisons. Excessive amounts of onions and garlic, sweet clover, and bracken fern also cause anemia and possible death.\nAnemia is caused by low iron and low blood levels. The iron in your blood allows oxygen to bind to your red blood cells to transport it to the cells of your body. If you are l \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 acking iron and red blood cells, your body has less transporters to take oxygen to your cells, including your brain cells.he iron in your blood allows oxygen to bind to your red blood cells to transport it to the cells of your body.

It binds to oxygen in your lungs, transports it throughout the body, and releases it to the cells and tissues.During pregnancy, a woman's hemoglobin must transport enough oxygen to meet both her and her fetus' needs.ron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia, but vitamin deficiency, kidney disease, inherited hemoglobin disorders, and other illnesses can also cause anemia. It is also possible to have a higher than normal hemoglobin level. This is usually caused by dehydration but may also result from a variety of diseases.\n1 The major causes of this type are iron deficiency (low level iron) anemia and thalassemia (inherited disorders of hemoglobin). 2  If the red blood cells size are normal in size (but low in number), this is called normocytic anemia, such as anemia that accompanies chronic disease or anemia related to kidney disease. In general, there are three major types of anemia, classified according to the size of the red blood cells: 2  If the red blood cells are smaller than normal, this is called microcytic anemia. 3  The major causes of this type are iron deficiency (low level iron) anemia and thalassemia (inherited disorders of hemoglobin).\nAnemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors.\nAnemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated.\nThere are three main causes of anemia: 1  Blood loss, either from a sudden event or slow internal bleeding. 2  A low number of red blood cells being made by the body. 3  A high rate of red blood cells being destroyed.\nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts. Also, the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal.Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells.It helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, chest pain, weakness, and fatigue (tiredness).If you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body.he most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts. Also, the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal.\nOverview. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a reduction in the levels of red blood cells and oxygen in your body. When iron supply is low, your body begins to use up its iron stores, preventing your body from making enough red blood cells.oor absorption is just one of the causes of iron deficiency, which can lead to a form of anemia and a variety of symptoms, including muscle aches.\nThere are many different types of anemia with many different causes. A handful of symptoms are shared by nearly all types of anemia, whether you have iron deficiency anemia or Fanconi anemia. And each type of anemia shares a basic end effect: Your body does not have enough oxygen-bearing red blood cells for its needs. Hemolytic anemia. 2  Jaundice, leg ulcers, and abdominal pain are hallmarks of this type of anemia, in which red blood cells are prematurely destroyed within the body. 3  The excess hemoglobin released by this destructive process causes many of the symptoms.\nIllnesses of the red blood cells. Most people don't think about their red blood cells unless they have a disease that affects these cells. Problems with red blood cells can be caused by illnesses or a lack of iron or vitamins in your diet. Some diseases of the red blood cells are inherited. Diseases of the red blood cells include many types of anemia, a condition in which there are too few red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen throughout the body.\nAnemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen.Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.nherited disorders can affect your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production of red blood cells. Thalassemias cause the body to make fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin -- and may be treated with blood transfusions. Among people with hemolytic anemia, red blood cells are destroyed and cleaned out of the bloodstream too quickly.\nAnemia develops when the body does not produce enough red blood cells or red cells are lost due to bleeding or other causes. In people with anemia, the blood is unable to supply enough oxygen to the body. There are many possible causes of anemia.Symptoms of anemia can include: 1  Fatigue. 2  Weakness. 3  Dizziness.hysicians in the Benign Hematology Program specialize in evaluating patients with abnormal blood counts to identify the cause of their condition and create a personalized treatment plan.\n1 Anemia is caused by either a decrease in production of red blood cells or hemoglobin, or an increase in loss (usually due to bleeding) or destruction of red blood cells. 2  Some patients with anemia have no symptoms.\nCauses of anemia can be grouped into two categories: anemia caused by insufficient RBC production and anemia caused by RBCs being destroyed too soon. 1  Anemia due to inadequate red blood cell production: Several conditions can cause a reduced production of red blood cells, including: Iron deficiency anemia.\n2: Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cells. A patient's diet can be a cause of anemia. A lack of iron or vitamin-rich foods severely impacts the body's capacity to produce enough healthy red blood cells. Individuals with anemia have far fewer healthy red blood cells.\nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin).Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.

You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death.\nAll are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the mild anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems. What Causes Anemia? There are more than 400 types of anemia, which are divided into three groups: Anemia caused by blood loss; Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production; Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells Anemia Caused by Blood Loss\nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.

Red blood cells are important for the transport of oxygen-rich blood to body tissues and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Red blood cells are red because they contain an iron-rich protein known as hemoglobin, which is bright red in color. Over time, red blood cells wear out and die.The bone marrow continually makes more red blood cells. Certain foods increase production of red blood cells.olic Acid-Rich Foods. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is a B-complex vitamin that helps the body make new healthy red blood cells. Patients with low levels of folic acid often develop anemia. Patients can increase red blood cells in the body by consuming foods rich in folic acid.\nHemolytic Anemias. Rarely, anemia is due to problems that cause the red blood cells (RBCs) to die or be destroyed prematurely. Normally, RBCs live in the blood for about four months.In hemolytic anemia, this time is shortened, sometimes to only a few days.emolytic Anemias. Rarely, anemia is due to problems that cause the red blood cells (RBCs) to die or be destroyed prematurely. Normally, RBCs live in the blood for about four months.\nTreating underlying causes of iron deficiency. If iron supplements don't increase your blood-iron levels, it's likely the anemia is due to a source of bleeding or an iron-absorption problem that your doctor will need to investigate and treat.Depending on the cause, iron deficiency anemia treatment may involve:f iron supplements don't increase your blood-iron levels, it's likely the anemia is due to a source of bleeding or an iron-absorption problem that your doctor will need to investigate and treat.

Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.\nHere are some possible causes: This type of anemia can be a cause of nausea and fatigue. Achrestic anemia is very similar to pernicious anemia that is caused by the deficiency in vitamin B12. This lowers the ability of your body to produce enough red blood cells. This lowers the amount of oxygen that circulates in your body.\nLow levels of vitamin B12 are a cause of megaloblastic anemia, in which red blood cells are larger than normal. Other possible causes include folate deficiency or various metabolic disorders. Anemia should be diagnosed by a physician to address the underlying cause. A.\nIf you have anemia, your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body. The most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms.More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.lood disorders can affect any of the three main components of blood: 1  Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. 2  White blood cells, which fight infections. 3  Platelets, which help blood to clot.\nSymptoms of hemolytic anemia are similar to other forms of anemia (fatigue and shortness of breath), but in addition, the breakdown of red cells leads to jaundice and increases the risk of particular long-term complications, such as gallstones and pulmonary hypertension.emolytic anemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). It has numerous possible causes, ranging from relatively harmless to life-threatening.\nHemolytic anemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular).It has numerous possible causes, ranging from relatively harmless to life-threatening.emolytic anemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular).

Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion. Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells. Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer. Treatment includes iron pills, or rarely, blood transfusion.\nBlood cells; red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets are made by the bone marrow. These blood cells divide quickly. Chemotherapy may lead to low blood counts, causing the possibility of a variety of symptoms. The symptoms depend on the type of low blood cell count.LOW RED BLOOD CELL COUNT (Anemia, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit). Red blood cells carry oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to check your blood count.The RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit are tests to see if you have low red blood count.he symptoms depend on the type of low blood cell count. LOW RED BLOOD CELL COUNT (Anemia, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit). Red blood cells carry oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to check your blood count.\n1 Pancytopenia-a lowering of all three types of blood cells; red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells, which may lead to low red blood cell count, low blood platlet count, and/or low white blood cell count. 2  Anemia-a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBC), which may lead to low red blood count.he symptoms depend on the type of low blood cell count. LOW RED BLOOD CELL COUNT (Anemia, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit). Red blood cells carry oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to check your blood count.\nA type of hemolytic anemia called autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a rare disease that causes antibodies to be made against a person's own red blood cells. Two blood tests can check for antibodies that attack red blood cells: the direct Coombs test and the indirect Coombs test.The direct Coombs test is done on a sample of red blood cells from the body. It detects antibodies that are already attached to red blood cells.The indirect Coombs test is done on a sample of the liquid part of the blood (serum). type of hemolytic anemia called autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a rare disease that causes antibodies to be made against a person's own red blood cells. Two blood tests can check for antibodies that attack red blood cells: the direct Coombs test and the indirect Coombs test.\nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death. Blood is made up of many parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (PLATE-lets), and plasma (the fluid portion of blood).\nCommon causes of anemia include the following: 1  Anemia from active bleeding: Loss of blood through heavy menstrual bleeding or wounds can cause anemia. 2  Iron deficiency anemia: The bone marrow needs iron to make red blood cells. 3  Anemia of chronic disease: Any long-term medical condition can lead to anemia.\nMany medical conditions cause anemia. Common causes of anemia include the following: Anemia from active bleeding: Loss of blood through heavy menstrual bleeding or wounds can cause anemia. Gastrointestinal ulcers or cancers such as cancer of the colon may slowly ooze blood and can also cause anemia. Iron deficiency anemia: The bone marrow needs iron to make red blood cells.\nA. Low levels of vitamin B12 are a cause of megaloblastic anemia, in which red blood cells are larger than normal. Other possible causes include folate deficiency or various metabolic disorders.Anemia should be diagnosed by a physician to address the underlying cause.. Low levels of vitamin B12 are a cause of megaloblastic anemia, in which red blood cells are larger than normal. Other possible causes include folate deficiency or various metabolic disorders.\nFor example, anemia in dogs can be caused by flea or worm infestations, injuries, or some more serious problems such as ulcers or even cancer. This page looks at some possible causes and symptoms of dog anemia, and some natural remedies that can encourage blood growth.Anemia in dogs is a condition in which the dog does not have enough red blood cells to transport oxygen to different parts of his body.Anemia is a symptom of an underlying problem.If your dog is anemic, it is therefore important that a check-up be conducted to find out and accordingly deal with the root cause. When we think of anemia, many of us will connect the condition with iron deficiency.n many cases, anemia in dogs is as a result of blood loss caused by any of the following: 1  Parasites, such as fleas and worms; 2  Wounds and traumas; 3  Toxic or chemical poisoning.\nAnemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells.Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia.nemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells.

More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.\nABSTRACT: Anemia, common in people with cancer, can be due to the disease itself or to the associated therapy. Fatigue, the most prevalent of all symptoms experienced by cancer patients, is the primary symptom of anemia.Caused by many factors, fatigue, regardless of etiology, has an adverse impact on health-related quality of life.Anemia is among the more treatable of those causes. Prior to the development of recombinant human erythropoietin, red blood cell transfusion was the standard treatment for cancer-related anemia.aused by many factors, fatigue, regardless of etiology, has an adverse impact on health-related quality of life.

These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated.\n1 The major causes of this type are iron deficiency (low level iron) anemia and thalassemia (inherited disorders of hemoglobin). 2  If the red blood cells size are normal in size (but low in number), this is called normocytic anemia, such as anemia that accompanies chronic disease or anemia related to kidney disease. If the red blood cells size are normal in size (but low in number), this is called normocytic anemia, such as anemia that accompanies chronic disease or anemia related to kidney disease. 2  If red blood cells are larger than normal, then it is called macrocytic anemia.\nOf the mutations leading to qualitative alterations in hemoglobin, the missense mutation in the \u00ce\u00b2-globin gene that causes sickle cell anemia is the most common. The mutation causing sickle cell anemia is a single nucleotide substitution (A to T) in the codon for amino acid 6.The change converts a glutamic acid codon (GAG) to a valine codon (GTG). The form of hemoglobin in persons with sickle cell anemia is referred to as HbS.f the mutations leading to qualitative alterations in hemoglobin, the missense mutation in the \u00ce\u00b2-globin gene that causes sickle cell anemia is the most common. The mutation causing sickle cell anemia is a single nucleotide substitution (A to T) in the codon for amino acid 6.\nAnemia is not a single disease but a condition, like fever, with many possible causes and many forms. Causes of anemia include nutritional deficiencies, inherited genetic defects, medication-related side effects, and chronic disease. It can also occur because of blood loss from injury or internal bleeding, the destruction of red blood cells, or insufficient red blood cell production.\nThe most common cause. The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency. Iron is an important factor in anemia because this mineral is used to make hemoglobin. the component of red blood cells that attaches to oxygen and transports it. Red blood cells exist only to oxygenate the body m and have a life span of about 120 days.\nSometimes, anemias are subclassified based upon the size and microscopic appearance of the red blood cells. In this regard, pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia refers to an abnormally large type of red blood cell (megaloblast).Megaloblasts are produced in the bone marrow when vitamin B-12 or folic acid levels are low.Megaloblastic anemia can also be caused by other disease of the bone marrow and can be a side effect of some cancer chemotherapy drugs.ometimes, anemias are subclassified based upon the size and microscopic appearance of the red blood cells. In this regard, pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia refers to an abnormally large type of red blood cell (megaloblast).\nAnemia is not exclusively caused by parasites, there are other causes that need to be considered too. Sometimes a blood disease, asaplasmosis, is a possibility, but it will likely be best to rule out internal parasites such as worms, liver flukes, coccidia protozoa, and external parasites such as lice & ticks first.\nThere are many potential causes of anemia. Anemia is diagnosed as any condition in which there is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells. Conditions where our body does not produce enough healthy red blood cells, destroys too many red blood cells, or loses circulating red blood cells can all lead to anemia.\nAnemia can be caused by the body not making enough red blood cells. It is also caused by their loss or destruction. Several factors can cause anemia: Too little iron, vitamin B12 or folate. A shortage of folate can cause megaloblastic anemia, where red blood cells are large and pale (see Fact Sheet 121).\nBroadly, causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell (RBC) production, increased RBC destruction (hemolytic anemias), blood loss and fluid overload (hypervolemia).\nIron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia among women in their childbearing years. However, there are many other possible causes, such as bleeding ulcers, sickle cell disease and ulcerative colitis. Anemia may also be caused by significant blood loss. How anemia is treated depends on the cause.\nSecondary Aplastic Anemia. Secondary aplastic anemia occurs after exposure to. environmental factors and in certain disorders. The fol-. lowing factors have been implicated as causes of sec-. ondary aplastic anemia: chemicals, drugs, infectious. agents, radiation, rheumatic disease, and pregnancy. Chemicals.\nMicrocytic anemia is a term used to characterize any type of anemia caused due to small red blood cells in human blood. In Microcytic anemia the red blood cells are paler than usual. Microcytic anemia is the most common types of anemia which is found.Causes. In most of the cases Microcytic anemia is caused because of the deficiency of iron.Thus it is the most sought after thing when a person is contacted with Microcytic anemia.n Microcytic anemia the red blood cells are paler than usual.

Bleeding and anemia from poisoning. Bruising, nosebleeds, blood in the stool, and anemia are caused by rat and mouse poisons. Excessive amounts of onions and garlic, sweet clover, and bracken fern also cause anemia and possible death. Heart symptoms from poisoning\nMedications or substances causing Anemia. The following drugs, medications, substances or toxins are some of the possible causes of Anemia as a symptom. This list is incomplete and various other drugs or substances may cause your symptoms (see Anemia).Always advise your doctor of any medications or treatments you are using, including prescription, over-the-counter, supplements, herbal or alternative treatments.1  A-Cillin.2  Aceta with Codeine. 3  Achromycin V.edications or substances causing Anemia. The following drugs, medications, substances or toxins are some of the possible causes of Anemia as a symptom. This list is incomplete and various other drugs or substances may cause your symptoms (see Anemia).\nCauses of anemia. Different types of anemia and their causes include: Iron deficiency anemia. This is the most common type of anemia worldwide. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by a shortage of iron in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without adequate iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. Without iron supplementation, this type of anemia occurs in many pregnant women. It is also caused by blood loss, such as from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer and regular use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, especially aspirin. Vitamin deficiency anemia. In addition to iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Additionally, some people may consume enough B-12, but their bodies aren't able to process the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also known as pernicious anemia. Anemia of chronic disease.\nIf both the RDW and MCV levels are increased, there are several possible causes. One possible cause is liver disease. The liver is the largest organ in the body and is responsible for filtering (removing) harmful chemical substances, producing important chemicals for the body, and other important functions. Another cause of high RDW & MCV levels is hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which the red blood cells are destroyed earlier than they should be.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.\nThere are three main causes of anemia: blood loss, lower than normal levels of red blood cell (RBC) production, or higher than normal rates of RBC destruction. More than one of these factors can combine to cause anemia. Blood loss is the most common cause of anemia, particularly iron-deficiency anemia. Blood loss can be short term or persist over time. It can be caused by heavy menstrual periods, bleeding in the digestive or urinary tracts, surgery, trauma, or cancer.\nMacrocytic anemia can be broken into two main types: megaloblastic and nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias. Megaloblastic macrocytic anemia. Most macrocytic anemias are also megaloblastic. Megaloblastic anemia is a result of errors in your red blood cell DNA production. This causes your body to make red blood cells incorrectly. Possible causes include: vitamin B-12 deficiency; folate deficiency; some medications, such as chemotherapy drugs like hydroxyurea, antiseizure medications, and antiretroviral drugs used for people with HIV; Nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia . Nonmegaloblastic forms of macrocytic anemia may be caused by a variety of factors. These can include: chronic alcohol use disorder (alcoholism) liver disease; hypothyroidism\nMany medical conditions cause anemia. Anemia from active bleeding: Loss of blood through heavy menstrual bleeding or wounds can cause anemia. Gastrointestinal ulcers or cancers such as cancer of the colon may slowly ooze blood and can also cause anemia.\nWhat are the causes of a low blood oxygen level? The body's tissues get oxygen from red blood cells, but when a person's red blood cell count is too low, tissues are deprived of a certain amount of oxygen. Many symptoms associated with anemia are caused by lowered oxygen in the blood.\nIf your diet is lacking in certain vitamins, vitamin deficiency anemia can develop. Or vitamin deficiency anemia may develop because your body can't properly absorb the nutrients from the foods you eat. Causes of vitamin deficiency anemias, also known as megaloblastic anemias, include: Vitamin C deficiency anemia. 2  Vitamin C deficiency can develop if you don't get enough vitamin C from the foods you eat. 3  Vitamin C deficiency is also possible if something impairs your ability to absorb vitamin C from food.\nAnemia happens when your blood does not have enough red blood cells to properly carry oxygen to your organs and tissues. Because your body does not get enough oxygen, you feel tired.Feeling tired is one of the primary symptoms of anemia. Your blood contains three types of cells: white blood cells, which fight off infection; platelets, which help blood to clot; and red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs throughout your body.ecause your body does not get enough oxygen, you feel tired. Feeling tired is one of the primary symptoms of anemia.

Two common causes of iron deficiency anemia are blood loss (most common) and decreased absorption of iron from food. Blood loss \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The source of blood loss may be obvious, such as in women who have heavy menstrual bleeding or multiple pregnancies, or a known bleeding ulcer.\nDizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury.The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. Low iron levels (anemia). 2  Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. 3  Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).\n1 Anemia from active bleeding: Loss of blood through heavy menstrual bleeding or wounds can cause anemia. 2  Gastrointestinal ulcers or cancers such as cancer of the colon may slowly ooze blood and can also cause anemia.\nSymptoms. PNH gets its name from one of its more common symptoms. About half of people with PNH pass dark or bright red blood in their urine at night or in the morning. Paroxysmal means sudden, nocturnal means at night, and hemoglobinuria means  blood in the urine ..PNH symptoms are caused by: 1  Broken red blood cells.2  Too few red blood cells (which can cause anemia). 3  Blood clots in your veins.aroxysmal means sudden, nocturnal means at night, and hemoglobinuria means  blood in the urine .. PNH symptoms are caused by: 1  Broken red blood cells. 2  Too few red blood cells (which can cause anemia).\nPossible causes of anemia include: 1  Certain medicines. 2  Destruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems) 3  Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis, or rheumatoid arthritis.\nBlood is composed of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood platelets. These cells and cell fragments are suspended in blood plasma. Abnormal amounts of these components can lead to several symptoms and health problems. These abnormalities can also be caused by an underlying disease.nemia develops when the body does not produce enough red blood cells or red cells are lost due to bleeding or other causes. In people with anemia, the blood is unable to supply enough oxygen to the body. There are many possible causes of anemia. Symptoms of anemia can include: 1  Fatigue.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells.

In people with anemia, the blood is unable to supply enough oxygen to the body. There are many possible causes of anemia. Symptoms of anemia can include: 1  Fatigue. 2  Weakness. 3  Dizziness.\nAnother possible cause of low blood oxygen saturation is anemia, which occurs when the red blood cells don't have adequate hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that acts as the oxygen carrier, according to the National Anemia Action Council. Anemia has many causes.\nSickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make hemoglobin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color. Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body.In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance.emoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.\nWhat is myelophthisic anemia? Myelophthisic anemia occurs when bone marrow wastes away (phthisis). What causes myelophthisic anemia? Myelophthisic anemia can be caused by a tumor that metastasizes (spreads) into the bone marrow, an inflammatory process (Tuberculosis, lupus etc.) or a lipid storage disease. Breast and prostate cancer are cancers that can commonly spread to the bones.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells.
