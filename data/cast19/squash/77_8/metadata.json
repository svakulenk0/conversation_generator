Traditionally, hospitality is very important.\nOther ingredients often added to bigos include  onion s, diced and browned in lard together with the meat, and dried forest  mushrooms  that are precooked separately in boiling water. The stew is usually seasoned with salt,  black pepper corns,  allspice ,  juniper berries  and  bay leaves . Some recipes also call for  caraway ,  clove s,  garlic ,  marjoram ,  mustard seed s,  nutmeg ,  paprika  and  thyme . The tart flavor of sauerkraut may be enhanced by adding some dry  red wine  or beet sour (fermented  beetroot  juice that is also a traditional ingredient of  borscht ), which may impart a reddish hue to the stew. Bigos is often slightly sweetened with sugar,  honey ,  raisin s,  prune s or plum butter known in Polish as  powid\u0142a .\nBigos (; , , or \u0431\u0456\u0433\u0443\u0441, ), also known in English as hunter's stew, is a  Polish  dish of finely chopped meat of various kinds stewed with  sauerkraut  and shredded fresh cabbage. The dish is also traditional for  Belarusian ,   Ukrainian  and  Lithuanian  cuisine.\nTraditionally, bigos is stewed in a cauldron over an open fire or in a large pot on a stove, but it may also be prepared in an electric  slow cooker . The contents should be stirred from time to time, to prevent scorching, which may impart a bitter taste to the entire batch. Bigos is considered best after it has been repeatedly refrigerated and reheated to allow the flavors to fuse.\nThe stew is typically dished up with  rye bread  or boiled potatoes. In a fancier setting, it may be served in stoneware bowls,  puff pastry  shells or  bread bowl s. Bigos, especially when enjoyed outdoor, is traditionally paired with shots of chilled  vodka , either clear or flavored. Varieties of flavored vodka that match well with bigos include  \u017cubr\u00f3wka  ( bison grass ), ja\u0142owc\u00f3wka (juniper),  pio\u0142un\u00f3wka  ( wormwood ),  Goldwasser  (various herbs) and  starka  (oak-aged). If served at home or in a restaurant, the stew may be washed down with beer, red wine or  Riesling .\nThe Polish national dishes are  bigos  ;  pierogi  ;  kielbasa ;  kotlet schabowy    breaded cutlet ;  go\u0142\u0105bki    cabbage roll s;  zrazy    roulade ;  piecze\u0144  roast ; sour  cucumber soup  (zupa og\u00f3rkowa, ); mushroom soup, (zupa grzybowa,  quite different from the North American  cream of mushroom ); zupa pomidorowa  tomato soup  ;  ros\u00f3\u0142   variety of meat broth;  \u017curek   sour rye soup;  flaki    tripe soup ;  barszcz   and  ch\u0142odnik   among others.\nBigos made entirely of meat and exotic spices was affordable only to the affluent Polish  nobility . The 18th century saw the development of a poor man's version of the dish, known as bigos hultajski, or \"rascal's bigos\", in which vinegar and lemon juice were replaced with cheaper sauerkraut as the source of tartness. Sauerkraut and cabbage also acted as a filler allowing to reduce the amount of meat in the dish. Rascal's bigos became common during the reign of King  Augustus III of Poland  (r. 1734\u20131763). Over the course of the 19th century, its rise in popularity continued as the proportion of meat decreased in favor of sauerkraut, eventually superseding all other kinds of bigos and losing the disparaging epithet in the process.\nThe Polish national dishes are  bigos  ;  pierogi  ;  kie\u0142basa ;  kotlet schabowy   (type of  breaded cutlet );  go\u0142\u0105bki   (type of  cabbage roll );  zrazy   (type of  roulade );  roast  () ; sour  cucumber soup  () ; mushroom soup, ()  (quite different from the North American  cream of mushroom );  tomato soup  () ;  ros\u00f3\u0142   (variety of meat broth);  \u017curek   (sour rye soup);  flaki   (variety of  tripe soup ); and  barszcz   among others.\nIn Poland, kie\u0142basa is often served garnished with fried onions, and \u2013 in the form of cut pieces \u2013 smoked kie\u0142basa can be served cold, hot, boiled, baked or grilled.
