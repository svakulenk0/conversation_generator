{"input_text": "In Germany, \"regular\" bologna is sometimes referred to as Mortadella, and is mostly identical and made out of the same meats as its American counterpart, although it often contains  pistachio s. The original, larger, and less finely ground Mortadella is then called italienische Mortadella.\nThe Romans called the sausage farcimen mirtatum (myrtle sausage), because the sausage was flavoured with  myrtle  berries, a popular spice before  pepper  became available to European markets.  Anna Del Conte  (The Gastronomy of Italy 2001) found a sausage mentioned in a document of the official body of meat preservers in Bologna dated 1376 that may be mortadella.\nThe berries, whole or ground, have been used as a pepper substitute. They contribute to the distinctive flavor of  Mortadella  sausage and the related American  Bologna sausage .\nMortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy. This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film La mortadella starring  Sophia Loren . The title for the United States release was  Lady Liberty .\nAfter  Mr. Burns  gets teased about his old car by the kids at  Springfield Elementary School , he sends  Homer  to pick  up a brand new  Lamborg otti   Faste rossa  car (a parody of the Lamborghini Gallardo) in  Italy . The family flies over on  Alitalia , and have a great time touring the country, despite Homer and  Bart 's mockery of the culture and  history of Italy  (causing an embarrassed  Lisa  to pretend to be  Canadian  so no one will assume that she is part of the family, though this backfires when Homer brings in an American flag to smooch off the other passengers). After two huge wheels, one made of  Mortadella  and the other of cheese lands on their car and crushes the hood, they slowly push it into a small (fictional)  Tuscan  village nearby called Salsiccia ( sausage ), and are told that the mayor speaks English.\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's  prosciutto ,  culatello  and  Felino salami , Piacenza's  pancetta ,  coppa  and salami, Bologna's  mortadella  and  salame rosa , Modena's  zampone ,  cotechino  and  cappello del prete   and  Ferrara 's  salama da sugo .

Crescentina  best known as  tigella  is the typical thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena and it is usually filled in with the typical cunza (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include  zuppa inglese  (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and  Alchermes  liqueur) and  panpepato  (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include  Sangiovese  from Romagna,  Lambrusco  from  Reggio Emilia  or  Modena ,  Cagnina di Romagna ,  Gutturnio  and  Trebbiano  from  Piacenza .\nBologna sausage, sometimes phonetically spelled baloney (), known in Europe as a Lyoner, is a  sausage  derived from  mortadella : a similar-looking, finely ground pork sausage containing cubes of  lard , originally from the Italian city of  Bologna  (). U.S. Government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground and without visible pieces of lard. Aside from  pork , bologna can alternatively be made out of  chicken ,  turkey ,  beef ,  venison , combined or  soy protein . Unlike the mortadella, bologna is not an Italian product and several differences among process and ingredients are seen. Typical seasoning for bologna includes  black pepper ,  nutmeg ,  allspice ,  celery seed ,  coriander , and like mortadella,  myrtle berries  give it its distinctive flavor.\nA mortadella sandwich is any sandwich using  mortadella , a large Italian sausage, and is a very popular  sandwich  in  Brazil  especially  S\u00e3o Paulo . The sandwich is made from nearly a half of a pound of mortadella  sausage ,  Provolone  cheese,  sourdough bread ,  mayonnaise  and  Dijon mustard .\nAlso from  Teramo  are the spreadable sausages flavored with nutmeg, liver sausages tasting of garlic and spices.

Mortadella di Campotosto is another product famous in Abruzzo; is a small mortadella, longish oval-shape. Inside, it is dark red, with a white column of fat. They are generally sold two tied together. Together, they are about as big as two cupped hands put together. Another name for the mortadella in Italian is \"coglioni di mulo\" (donkey's balls.); using meat from the shoulder and loin and trimmings from making prosciutto, mixed with fat. In all, it is 80% lean meat, of which 25% will be prosciutto (ham), and 20% pancetta. The meat is finely minced, and mixed with seasonings (salt, pepper, white wine.)

In  Poland , mortadela slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional  pork chop s.\nHorse meat is used in a variety of recipes: as a stew called pastissada (typical of  Verona ), served as steaks, as  carpaccio , or made into  bresaola . Thin strips of horse meat called sfilacci are popular . Horse fat is used in recipes such as  pezzetti di cavallo . Horse meat sausages and salamis are traditional in various places .

Donkey  is also cooked, for example as a stew called stracotto d'asino and as meat for sausages e.g. mortadella d'asino . The  cuisine of Parma  features a horsemeat  tartare  called pesto di cavallo, as well as various cooked dishes.\nOn 8th Avenue and 28th Street, in the Chelsea area of Manhattan, (NYC), two friends from Italy decided to open an Italian Deli,  . Salumeria is a place where fresh meats are being processed and sold which are called.In 1925 they opened the business and called it Italian Salumeria Biellese-Groceries and Charcuterie. They made many of the Italian dry cured salted meats such as  salame  (Cured or cooked stuffed in an intestine casing),  capocollo  (cured neck meat made spicy and non spicy),  mortadella  (Cooked, baloney like meat with large fat chunks),  zampino  (Cooked, salami like meat, stuffed in the pork skin of the leg casing rather than an intestine casing),  testa     (head cheese. Made of all scraps mixed with gelatine then stuffed in a casing),  sausages  (salame like meat, stuffed in small and large intestine casings), and other deli items.. Salumeria Biellese supplied restaurants with their famous on the premises made sausages. They also prepared cooked meats such as roast beef, roast pork, sausages in tomato sauce, etc. Today Salumeria Biellese moved to the corner of 8th Avenue and 29th street. It is still a classic Italian Salumeria/Deli but added seating for those who chose to eat in. The menu has home cooked meals and hot and cold sandwiches, salads, etc.The owners expanded their production line with the opening of a factory in New Jersey. The partners also opened an Italian Restaurant called Biricchino at 260 west 29th street Manhattan.This business grew with the growing population of New York City and surrounding areas. Salumeria Biellese was selected as a recipient in the Slow food NYC with a seal of approval in 2010.This business is almost 100 years (in 2025) in the same area on 8th Avenue in NYC.Today the business is located at 8th Ave. and 29th street one block north from the former location.\nMortadella originated in  Bologna , the capital of  Emilia-Romagna ; elsewhere in Italy it may be made either in the Bolognese manner or in a distinctively local style. The mortadella of  Prato  is a  Tuscan  speciality flavoured with pounded  garlic . The mortadella of  Amatrice , high in the  Apennines  of northern  Lazio , is unusual in being lightly smoked. Because it originated in Bologna, this contributed to the naming of the American sausage meat \" bologna \".\nIn  Puerto Rico , people consume \"smoked mortadella,\" but some confuse it with commercial salami, or with salami cotto, because cafeterias, panaderias, colmados and restaurant buy the bulk of whole smoked mortadella. While salami may contain pork, beef, veal and small pieces of fat uniformly distributed within the sausage, mortadella has the traditional larger chunks, not so uniformly distributed. Its diameter is much larger than that of hard salami and more closely resembles salami cotto (cooked) in size, hence the confusion of some people. It is smaller in diameter than the traditional mortadella de Bologna because the smoking process causes some shrinkage. It is best served at room temperature to bring out its rich flavour.\nMortadella () is a large  Italian sausage  or  luncheon meat  ( salume  ) made of finely hashed or ground, heat-cured  pork , which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat (principally the hard fat from the neck of the pig).

It has given its name to the well-known  Bolognese sauce , a meat based pasta sauce called in Italy  rag\u00f9  alla bolognese but in the city itself just rag\u00f9 as in  Tagliatelle  al rag\u00f9. Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured  pork  meats such as  prosciutto ,  mortadella  and  salumi  is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include  Pignoletto  dei Colli Bolognesi,  Lambrusco  di Modena and  Sangioves e di Romagna.  Tagliatelle  with  rag\u00f9 ,  lasagne ,  tortellini  served in broth, and mortadella, the original  Bologna sausage , are among the local specialties. Traditional Bolognese desserts are often linked to holidays, such as fave dei morti, multi-coloured almond paste cookies made for  All Saints' Day , jam-filled raviole cookies that are served on  Saint Joseph's Day , and carnival sweets known as sfrappole, a light and delicate fried pastry topped with powder sugar. Torta di riso, a custard-like cake made of almonds, rice and amaretto, is made throughout the year.\nMortadella is also very popular in  Argentina ,  Bolivia ,  Peru ,  Brazil ,  Ecuador ,  Chile ,  Colombia ,  Uruguay  and  Venezuela , thanks to the Italian immigrants who settled in these countries in the early 20th century. The normal spelling in these countries, however, is mortadela, and its recipe is quite similar to the traditional Italian, with additional pepper grains.\nCh\u1ea3 l\u1ee5a  or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish  b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n .\nMaddalena Ciarrapico arrives in New York City from Italy to get married and bringing with her a gift of  mortadella  (large Italian pork sausage) from her co-workers from the sausage factory where she used to work, for her fianc\u00e9.   But she is refused permission to bring the mortadella  into the country because of the ban on meat that may contain food-borne diseases.  An indignant Maddalena refuses to hand the sausage over, staying in the customs office at the airport, sparking a diplomatic incident in which she attracts widespread sympathy and support.\nMortadella is very popular in  Spain  and  Portugal , where a variety with  pepper  and  olive s is widely consumed, especially in sandwiches. Sometimes, in eastern Spain, the standard mortadella is referred to as mortadela italiana (Italian mortadella), because there is a local variant named catalana.\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's  prosciutto ,  culatello  and  Felino  salami, Piacenza's  pancetta ,  coppa  and salami, Bologna's  mortadella  and salame rosa, Modena's  zampone ,  cotechino  and  cappello del prete   and  Ferrara 's  salama da sugo .

Many see her as a kind of opposing faction to the local Camorra, taking as many of the people she grew up with under her wing as she can and trying to make their life better piece by piece, person by person as opposed to the ideologists Elena is now familiar with.  Though often reading the same competitiveness into Lila that Elena herself is driven by , after an  enormous earthquake , she comes to realize how truly different they are. While Elena herself is in harmony with the wild nature of the universe, Lila is desperate to tame and control it.\nMortadella Bologna has  Protected Geographical Indication  status under  European Union law . The zone of production is extensive: as well as  Emilia-Romagna  and the neighbouring regions of  Piedmont ,  Lombardy ,  Veneto ,  Marche  and  Tuscany , it includes Lazio and  Trentino .\nThe meat in Mortadella is usually pork.
