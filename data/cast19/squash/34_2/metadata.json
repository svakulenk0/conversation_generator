{"input_text": "By the  Late Bronze Age , Hittite had started losing ground to its close relative  Luwian . It appears that in the 13th century BC, Luwian was the most widely spoken language in the Hittite capital of  Hattusa . After the collapse of the Hittite Empire as a part of the more general  Late Bronze Age collapse , Luwian emerged in the Early  Iron Age  as the main language of the so-called  Syro-Hittite states  in southwestern  Anatolia  and northern  Syria .\nArchaeological evidence for early settlement suggests that there were occupation sites scattered throughout the area, rather than a village or town. There is evidence of Neolithic settlers in the form of stone axes and arrowheads, as well as the waste left by tool-making. Shards of  Early Bronze Age  pottery have been found, and in 1747, a hoard of spearheads and bronze rapiers were found on Crowle Moor, suggesting that settlement continued through the third, second and first millennia BCE. It continued through the  Romano-British  period, with finds in the parish suggesting a number of farmsteads, similar to those found in excavations at nearby  Sandtoft  during the construction of the  M180 motorway . The grouping together of individual settlements to form a community probably took place in the  Anglo-Saxon  period.\nOver time, construction and maintenance of roads and many other human acts, along with acts of nature such as earthquakes, movement of water, and  tectonic  shift can obliterate or damage the monumented locations of land boundaries. The land surveyor is often compelled to consider other evidence such as fence locations, wood lines, monuments on neighboring properties, and people's recollections. This other evidence is known as extrinsic evidence and is a fairly common principle. Extrinsic evidence is defined as evidence outside the writings, in this case evidence outside of the deed. Extrinsic evidence is held to be of equal value to evidence from another source.\nExcavations on the estate in 2002 revealed evidence from all periods of human cultural development.The earliest evidence of human activity is a Neolithic polished stone axe that was discovered in a small pit with the remains of a pot that appears to be of Middle Bronze Age. The first evidence of settlement consists of traces of oval and circular dwelling structures from the Early Bronze Age (around 4,000 years old).  The Iron Age gives some pottery evidence but none of settlement. Two burials have been found dating to the Roman period, although they seem to be in the native rather than Roman tradition.  Traces of Saxon settlement, rare in Hertfordshire, have been found. There are  remains of at least eight  grubenhause , sunken-floored buildings that are typical of this period. Medieval pottery contemporary with the building of the first manor house have been found in ditches.\nDespite the loss of territory, military weakness, and evident reduction in literacy and culture, the Kassite dynasty was the longest-lived dynasty of Babylon, lasting until 1155 BC, when Babylon was conquered by Shutruk-Nakhunte of Elam, and reconquered a few years later by the  Nebuchadnezzar I , part of the larger Late Bronze Age collapse.\nAlthough Homer refers to a union of the Greek kingdoms under the leadership of the king of Mycenea during the  Trojan War , there is no evidence that these kingdoms were dominated by a central power. Most of the Mycenean palaces were destroyed at the end of the 13th century BC. The Greek tradition relates this destruction to the Dorians, but it is suggested that the  Dorian invasion  was only one of the causes of the Bronze Age collapse in the Eastern  Mediterranean , as there is no evidence that the newcomers established a different civilization. The destruction was followed by the  Greek Dark Ages  with very poor archaeological findings, when most occupied areas were deserted, but some areas like  Attica  occupied by the Ionians remained untouched by the invaders. Several Greek tribes moved to regions of Greece where they acquired different names, and population groups moved through the islands to the western coasts of Asia Minor where they kept their native names Aeolians, Ionians and Dorians.\nGaza enjoyed demographic and economic growth again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle Tell as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization and all of the cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd century BCE. In its place emerged semi-nomadic cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the  Early Bronze Age IV . An urban center known as  Tell al-Ajjul  began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the  Middle Bronze Age , Tell as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in  Canaan ite territory, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite  Hyksos , a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. This city was destroyed about a century later, when the Hyksos were routed from Egypt. Egypt settled Gaza once again and Tell al-Ajjul rose for the third time in the 15th century BCE. The city finally ceased to exist in the 14th century, at the end of the Bronze Age.\nIn the 13th century BCE, at the end of the  Bronze Age , seafaring invaders from  Europe  and the  Aegean  known as the  Sea Peoples  entered the  Eastern Mediterranean , invading  Anatolia ,  Syria ,  Canaan ,  Cyprus  and  Egypt . The invasions by the Sea Peoples ushered the  Bronze Age Collapse , which resulted in the cultural collapse of  Mycenean Greece , the  Hittite Empire , the  New Kingdom of Egypt  and the civilizations of Canaan and Syria. The Sea Peoples are regarded as being composed of various groups of  Indo-European  peoples.\nDuring the late Bronze Age the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement. The first wave consisted of  Mycenaean Greek  traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC. A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the  Bronze Age collapse  of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050 BC, with the island's predominantly Greek character dating from this period. Cyprus occupies an important role in  Greek mythology  being the birthplace of  Aphrodite  and  Adonis , and home to  King Cinyras ,  Teucer  and  Pygmalion . Beginning in the 8th century BC  Phoenician colonies  were founded on the south coast of Cyprus, near present-day  Larnaca  and  Salamis .\nThe most eminent of early biblical archaeologists was  William F. Albright , who believed that he had identified the Patriarchal age in the period 2100\u20131800 BC, the Intermediate  Bronze Age , the interval between two periods of highly developed urban culture in ancient  Canaan . Albright argued that he had found evidence of the  sudden collapse  of the previous Early Bronze Age culture, and ascribed this to the invasion of migratory  pastoral nomads  from the northeast whom he identified with the  Amorites  mentioned in Mesopotamian texts. According to Albright, Abraham was a wandering Amorite who migrated from the north into the central highlands of Canaan and the Negev with his flocks and followers as the Canaanite city-states collapsed. Albright,  E. A. Speiser  and  Cyrus Gordon  argued that although the texts described by the documentary hypothesis were written centuries after the Patriarchal age, archaeology had shown that they were nevertheless an accurate reflection of the conditions of the 2nd millennium BC: \"We can assert with full confidence that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were actual historical individuals.\"\nThe first excavations at Tel \u2018Afula, carried out in 1948, found Late Chalcolithic\u2013Early Bronze Age remains. Tombs from the Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age II, Late Bronze Age\u2013Iron Age I and Roman period were discovered near the municipal water tower. Archaeologists discovered the Crusader-Mamluk fortress on the southern peak of the  tell , a Byzantine olive press and evidence of an Early Bronze Age settlement near the northern peak.\nThe Mycenaean civilization started to collapse from 1200 BC. Archaeology suggests that, around 1100 BC, the palace centres and outlying settlements of the Mycenaeans' highly organized culture began to be abandoned or destroyed, and by 1050 BC, the recognizable features of Mycenaean culture had disappeared, and the population had decreased significantly. Many explanations attribute the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and the  Bronze Age collapse  to climatic or environmental catastrophe, combined with an invasion by  Dorians  or by the  Sea Peoples , or to the widespread availability of edged weapons of iron, but no single explanation fits the available  archaeological evidence .\nVarious and currently outdated theories have been proposed that postulate waves of  migration  during the  Middle Bronze Age  in the  Ancient Near East . While the turmoils that separate the Late Bronze Age from the Early Iron Age are well documented (see  Bronze Age collapse ), theories of migration during the Middle Bronze Age (20th century BCE) have little direct support.\nThe  Bronze Age Collapse  from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a  dark age  for the entire  Near East ,  North Africa ,  Asia Minor ,  Caucasus ,  Mediterranean , and  Balkan  regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.\nThe end of the Ottom\u00e1ny culture is connected with turbulent events at the end of Old Bronze Age in Central Europe, where there was a collapse of the whole \"Old Bronze Age world\" with its highly advanced culture of mighty hill-forts, rich burials, and trade over wast distances. The gradual decline in the number of fortified settlements, change of burial rites, and the decision of people to desert fortified settlements could have had several reasons, including the collapse of trade and exchange networks, the attacks of enemies, the internal collapse of society or environmental causes. The following Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age cultures are very different in their burial rites (cremation, erecting of barrows) as well as in their handling of bronze - there is an \"explosion\" in bronze working, and many bronze hoards found across all of Europe illustrate this change in quantity and quality of produced bronze objects. We see not only bronze ornaments and arms (including first examples of  sword s), but also bronze tools ( sickle s,  axe s,  adze s), which changed the everyday life of prehistoric man.\nBronze Age collapse theories have described aspects of the end of the Age in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean region, the  Mycenaean  administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy. Several Minoan  client states  lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the  breadbasket  of the Minoan empire, the area north of the  Black Sea , also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some capacity to cultivate crops.\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the name given by those historians who see the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age  as violent, sudden and culturally disruptive, expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Middle East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the  Dark Age  that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite  and  Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nIncreasingly, the Iron Age in Europe is being seen as a part of the  Bronze Age collapse  in the  ancient Near East , in   ancient India  (with the post- Rigvedic   Vedic civilization ),  ancient Iran , and  ancient Greece  (with the  Greek Dark Ages ). In other regions of  Europe , the Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in  Central Europe  and the 6th century BC in  Northern Europe . The Near Eastern Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200\u20131000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous  Late Bronze Age . There is no definitive cultural break between the 13th and 12th century BC throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country,  Transjordan , and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the  Aramaean  and  Sea People  groups. There is evidence, however, that shows strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late 2nd millennium.\nThe Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the  Cypriot  forests causing the end of the bronze trade. These forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that  charcoal  production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late Bronze Age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.\nThere is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural patterns which some scholars think may indicate an invasion (or at least a migration) into Southern Great Britain around the 12th century BC. This disruption was felt far beyond Britain, even beyond Europe, as most of the great  Near East ern empires collapsed (or experienced severe difficulties) and the  Sea Peoples  harried the entire  Mediterranean  basin around this time.  Cremation  was adopted as a burial practice, with  cemeteries  of  urns  containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record. According to  John T. Koch  and others, the Celtic languages developed during this Late Bronze Age period in an intensely trading-networked culture called the  Atlantic Bronze Age  that included  Britain, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal, but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the  Hallstatt culture .\nThe  Thera eruption  occurred around the Aegean Collapse,  north of Crete. Speculation include a  tsunami  from Thera (more commonly known today as Santorini) destroyed Cretan cities. A tsunami may have destroyed the Cretan  navy  in its home harbour, which then lost crucial naval battles; so that in the  LMIB/LMII  event (c. 1450 BC) the cities of  Crete  burned and the  Mycenaean civilization  took over  Knossos . If the eruption occurred in the late 17th century BC (as most chronologists now think) then its immediate effects belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition, and not to the end of the Late Bronze Age; but it could have triggered the instability that led to the collapse first of Knossos and then of Bronze Age society overall. One such theory looks to the role of Cretan expertise in administering the empire, post-Thera. If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, then the Mycenaeans may have made political and commercial mistakes in administering the Cretan empire.\nThe Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of  ironworking  technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in the present  Bulgaria  and  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.\nRobert Drews describes the collapse as \"the worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\" A number of people have spoken of the cultural memories of the disaster as stories of a \"lost  golden age \".  Hesiod  for example spoke of Ages of Gold, Silver, and Bronze, separated from the modern harsh cruel world of the Age of Iron by the  Age of Heroes . Rodney Castledon even suggests that memories of the Bronze Age collapse even influenced  Plato 's story of  Atlantis  in  Timaeus  and the  Critias .\nSyrian sites previously showed evidence of trade links with  Mesopotamia  ( Assyria  and  Babylonia ),  Egypt  and the  Aegean  in the Late Bronze Age. Evidence, at  Ugarit , shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of Merneptah (ruled 1213\u20131203 BC) and even the fall of  Chancellor Bay  (died 1192 BC). The last Bronze Age king of the  Semitic  state of Ugarit,  Ammurapi , was a contemporary of the  Hittite  king  Suppiluliuma II . The exact dates of his reign are unknown.\nMore recently, it has been shown how the diversion of midwinter storms from the Atlantic to north of the Pyrenees and the Alps, bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean, was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse.\nUsing the  Palmer Drought Index  for 35 Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern weather stations, it was shown that a drought of the kind that persisted from January 1972 would have affected all of the sites associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse. Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socioeconomic problems and led to wars.\nThe development of iron smelting was once attributed to the  Hittites  of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. It was believed that they maintained a monopoly on ironworking, and that their empire had been based on that advantage. Accordingly, the invading  Sea Peoples  were responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. This theory is no longer held in the common current thought of the majority of scholarship, since there is no archaeological evidence of the alleged Hittite monopoly. While there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period; and only a small number of these objects are weapons. As part of the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age, the  Bronze Age collapse  saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region. The  Ugaritic script  was in use during this time, around 1300 BC.  Ugarit  was one of the centres of the literate world.\nThe Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the  Greek Dark Ages , that lasted for more than 400 years. Other cities like  Athens  continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover. These sites in Greece show evidence of the collapse:\nThe growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include interruption of maritime trade by piracy by the  Sea Peoples , as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the Dorian migration or invasion.\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse was a  Dark Age  transition period in the  Aegean Region ,  Southwestern Asia  and the  Eastern Mediterranean  from the Late  Bronze Age  to the Early  Iron Age  that historians believe was violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. The  palace economy  of the Aegean Region and  Anatolia  that characterised the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the  Greek Dark Ages .\nThe collapse of the Hittite Empire is usually associated with the gradual decline of Eastern Mediterranean trade networks and the resulting  collapse of major Late Bronze Age cities  in the Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean.At the beginning of the 12th century BC,  Wilusa  ( Troy ) was destroyed and the  Hittite Empire  suffered a sudden devastating attack from the  Kaskas , who occupied the coasts around the  Black Sea , and who joined with the  Mysians . They proceeded to destroy almost all Hittite sites but  were finally defeated by the  Assyria ns beyond the southern borders near the  Tigris .   Hatti ,  Arzawa  ( Lydia ),  Alashiya  ( Cyprus ),  Ugarit  and  Alalakh  were destroyed.\nThe decline of Bronze-Age civilizations in Egypt, Greece and Mesopotamia has been attributed to a long-term drought that began around 2000 bc. Now palaeoclimatologists propose that a similar fate was followed by the enigmatic Indus Valley Civilization, at about the same time.", "key": "34_2", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.024928", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
