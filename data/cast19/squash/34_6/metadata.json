{"input_text": "Periods of rapid climate change generally saw a collapse of this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with  subsistence agricultural  foodstuffs; and transhumance  pastoralism  became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms. During the periods of the collapse of  Akkadian Empire  in  Mesopotamia  and the  First Intermediate Period of Egypt , the  Hyksos  invasions and the end of the Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late  Bronze Age collapse , trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree  Assyria , withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the  Philistine  and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from  Kadesh Barnea , through  Hebron ,  Lachish ,  Jerusalem ,  Bethel ,  Samaria ,  Shechem ,  Shiloh  through  Galilee  to  Jezreel ,  Hazor  and  Megiddo . Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from  Eilath ,  Timna ,  Edom  ( Seir ),  Moab ,  Ammon  and thence to the Aramean states of  Damascus  and  Palmyra . Earlier states (for example the Philistines and  Tyrians  in the case of  Judah  and  Samaria , for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.\nBronze Age Britain  had large reserves of  tin  in  Cornwall  and  Devon , and tin is necessary to  smelt   bronze . At that time the sea level was much lower, and so tin for export could be brought across the  Solent  at low tide on carts, or possibly on boats such as those found at  Ferriby . A shortage of tin during the  Bronze Age collapse  and trade disruptions in the  Mediterranean  around 1300 BCE may have forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze.\nIn the 13th century BCE, at the end of the  Bronze Age , seafaring invaders from  Europe  and the  Aegean  known as the  Sea Peoples  entered the  Eastern Mediterranean , invading  Anatolia ,  Syria ,  Canaan ,  Cyprus  and  Egypt . The invasions by the Sea Peoples ushered the  Bronze Age Collapse , which resulted in the cultural collapse of  Mycenean Greece , the  Hittite Empire , the  New Kingdom of Egypt  and the civilizations of Canaan and Syria. The Sea Peoples are regarded as being composed of various groups of  Indo-European  peoples.\nThe Ancient  Levant  had been initially dominated by a number of indigenous  Semitic speaking peoples ; the  Canaan ites, the  Amorites  and  Assyria ns, in addition to Indo-European powers; the  Luwians ,  Mitanni  and the  Hittites . However, during the collapse of the Late Bronze Age, the coastal regions came under attack from a collection of nine seafaring tribes known as the  Sea Peoples . The transitional period is believed by historians to have been a violent, sudden and culturally disruptive time. During this period, the Eastern Mediterranean saw the fall of the  Mycenaean Kingdoms , the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the  New Kingdom of Egypt  in Syria and Canaan.\nThe  Bronze Age  begins around 2500 BC with the first appearance of bronze objects in the archaeological record. This coincides with the appearance of the characteristic  Beaker culture ; again it is unknown whether this was brought about primarily by folk movement or by cultural assimilation, and again it may be a mixture of both. The Bronze Age sees a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual, and the rise to prominence of increasingly powerful elites, whose power was enshrined in the control of the flow of precious resources, to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects such as swords and axes, and their prowess as hunters and warriors. Settlement became increasingly permanent and intensive. Towards the end of the period, numerous examples of extremely fine metalwork begin to be found deposited in rivers, presumably for ritual reasons and perhaps reflecting a progressive shift of emphasis away from the sky and back to the earth, as a rising population increasingly put the land under greater pressure. England largely also becomes in this period bound up with the  Atlantic trade system , which created something of a cultural continuum over a large part of Western Europe. It is possible that the  Celtic languages  developed or spread to England as part of this system; by the end of the Iron Age at the very least there is ample evidence that they were spoken across the whole of England, as well as the Western parts of Britain.\nThe end of the Ottom\u00e1ny culture is connected with turbulent events at the end of Old Bronze Age in Central Europe, where there was a collapse of the whole \"Old Bronze Age world\" with its highly advanced culture of mighty hill-forts, rich burials, and trade over wast distances. The gradual decline in the number of fortified settlements, change of burial rites, and the decision of people to desert fortified settlements could have had several reasons, including the collapse of trade and exchange networks, the attacks of enemies, the internal collapse of society or environmental causes. The following Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age cultures are very different in their burial rites (cremation, erecting of barrows) as well as in their handling of bronze - there is an \"explosion\" in bronze working, and many bronze hoards found across all of Europe illustrate this change in quantity and quality of produced bronze objects. We see not only bronze ornaments and arms (including first examples of  sword s), but also bronze tools ( sickle s,  axe s,  adze s), which changed the everyday life of prehistoric man.\nBronze Age collapse theories have described aspects of the end of the Age in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean region, the  Mycenaean  administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy. Several Minoan  client states  lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the  breadbasket  of the Minoan empire, the area north of the  Black Sea , also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some capacity to cultivate crops.\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the name given by those historians who see the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age  as violent, sudden and culturally disruptive, expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Middle East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the  Dark Age  that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite  and  Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nIncreasingly, the Iron Age in Europe is being seen as a part of the  Bronze Age collapse  in the  ancient Near East , in   ancient India  (with the post- Rigvedic   Vedic civilization ),  ancient Iran , and  ancient Greece  (with the  Greek Dark Ages ). In other regions of  Europe , the Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in  Central Europe  and the 6th century BC in  Northern Europe . The Near Eastern Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200\u20131000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous  Late Bronze Age . There is no definitive cultural break between the 13th and 12th century BC throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country,  Transjordan , and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the  Aramaean  and  Sea People  groups. There is evidence, however, that shows strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late 2nd millennium.\nThere is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural patterns which some scholars think may indicate an invasion (or at least a migration) into Southern Great Britain around the 12th century BC. This disruption was felt far beyond Britain, even beyond Europe, as most of the great  Near East ern empires collapsed (or experienced severe difficulties) and the  Sea Peoples  harried the entire  Mediterranean  basin around this time.  Cremation  was adopted as a burial practice, with  cemeteries  of  urns  containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record. According to  John T. Koch  and others, the Celtic languages developed during this Late Bronze Age period in an intensely trading-networked culture called the  Atlantic Bronze Age  that included  Britain, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal, but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the  Hallstatt culture .\nCommon factors that may contribute to societal collapse are economical, environmental, social and cultural, and disruptions in one domain sometimes cascade into others.  In some cases a natural disaster (e.g.  tsunami ,  earthquake , massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a  Malthusian catastrophe ,  overpopulation  or  resource depletion  might be the proximate cause of collapse.  Significant inequity may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a  revolution . The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures.   Jared Diamond  suggests that societies have also collapsed through deforestation, loss of soil fertility, restrictions of trade and/or rising endemic violence.\nPeriodic breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons. The demands for labor has from time to time led to population increases that push the limits of the ecological carrying capacity, and should a period of climatic instability ensue, collapsing central government and declining populations can occur. Alternatively, military vulnerability to invasion from marginal hill tribes or nomadic pastoralists has led to periods of trade collapse and neglect of irrigation systems. Equally, centripetal tendencies amongst city states has meant that central authority over the whole region, when imposed, has tended to be ephemeral, and localism has fragmented power into tribal or smaller regional units. These trends have continued to the present day in Iraq.\nAn ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by  smelting  its own  copper  and alloying with  tin ,  arsenic , or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Copper-tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in  Western Asia  before trading in bronze began in the  third millennium BC . Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the  Neolithic  period, with the  Chalcolithic  serving as a transition. Although the  Iron Age  generally followed the Bronze Age, in some areas (such as  Sub-Saharan Africa ), the Iron Age intruded directly on the Neolithic from outside the region.\nThe  Thera eruption  occurred around the Aegean Collapse,  north of Crete. Speculation include a  tsunami  from Thera (more commonly known today as Santorini) destroyed Cretan cities. A tsunami may have destroyed the Cretan  navy  in its home harbour, which then lost crucial naval battles; so that in the  LMIB/LMII  event (c. 1450 BC) the cities of  Crete  burned and the  Mycenaean civilization  took over  Knossos . If the eruption occurred in the late 17th century BC (as most chronologists now think) then its immediate effects belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition, and not to the end of the Late Bronze Age; but it could have triggered the instability that led to the collapse first of Knossos and then of Bronze Age society overall. One such theory looks to the role of Cretan expertise in administering the empire, post-Thera. If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, then the Mycenaeans may have made political and commercial mistakes in administering the Cretan empire.\nThe gradual breakdown and transformation of economic and social linkages and infrastructure resulted in increasingly localized outlooks. This breakdown was often fast and dramatic as it became unsafe to travel or carry goods over any distance; there was a consequent collapse in trade and manufacture for export. Major industries that depended on trade, such as large-scale pottery manufacture, vanished almost overnight in places like Britain.  Tintagel  in  Cornwall , as well as several other centers, managed to obtain supplies of Mediterranean luxury goods well into the 6th century, but then lost their trading links. Administrative, educational and military infrastructure quickly vanished, and the loss of the established  cursus honorum  led to the collapse of the schools and to a rise of illiteracy even among the leadership. The careers of  Cassiodorus  (died c. 585) at the beginning of this period and of  Alcuin of York  (died 804) at its close were founded alike on their valued literacy. For the formerly Roman area, there was another 20 percent decline in population between 400 and 600, or a one-third decline for 150-600. In the 8th century, the volume of trade reached its lowest level. The very small number of  shipwreck s found that dated from the 8th century supports this (which represents less than 2 percent of the number of shipwrecks dated from the 1st century). There were also reforestation and a retreat of agriculture that centered around 500.\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age , expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Near East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BCE. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite   Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BCE, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nThe archaeological evidence shows a widespread  collapse of Bronze Age civilization  in the Eastern Mediterranean world at the outset of the period, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. Around then, the  Hittite  civilization suffered serious disruption and cities from  Troy  to  Gaza  were destroyed. Following the collapse, fewer and smaller settlements suggest famine and depopulation. In Greece, the  Linear B  writing of the  Greek language  used by Mycenaean bureaucrats ceased. The decoration on  Greek pottery  after about 1100 BC lacks the figurative decoration of Mycenaean ware and is restricted to simpler, generally geometric styles (1000\u2013700 BC).\nThe Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the  Greek Dark Ages , that lasted for more than 400 years. Other cities like  Athens  continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover. These sites in Greece show evidence of the collapse:\nThe Sea People invasions are often listed among the causes or symptoms of the  Bronze Age collapse .  Ramesses had fought the Sea Peoples in southern  Lebanon , at the  Battle of Djahy . Ramesses III describes a great movement of peoples in the East from the Mediterranean, which caused a massive destruction of the former great powers of the Levant, Cyprus and Anatolia:\nThe coupled breakdown of economic, cultural and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse. In his book  Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed ,  Jared Diamond  proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.\nDiamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbors, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and failure to adapt to  environmental issues .\nModern archaeological evidence identifies the start of large-scale iron production in around 1200 BC, marking the end of the  Bronze Age . Between 1200 BC and 1000 BC, diffusion in the understanding of iron metallurgy and use of iron objects was fast and far-flung.  Anthony Snodgrass  suggests that a shortage of tin, as a part of the  Bronze Age Collapse  and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BC, forced  metalworkers  to seek an alternative to bronze. As evidence, many bronze implements were recycled into weapons during this time. More widespread use of iron led to improved steel-making technology at lower cost. Thus, even when tin became available again, iron was cheaper, stronger, and lighter, and  forged iron implements superseded cast bronze tools permanently.\nThe Mycenaean civilization perished with the  collapse of Bronze-Age civilization  on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the  Dorian invasion , although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well. Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after  LH III C , when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the  Greek Dark Ages  of traditional historiography.\nThe growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include interruption of maritime trade by piracy by the  Sea Peoples , as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the Dorian migration or invasion.\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse was a  Dark Age  transition period in the  Aegean Region ,  Southwestern Asia  and the  Eastern Mediterranean  from the Late  Bronze Age  to the Early  Iron Age  that historians believe was violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. The  palace economy  of the Aegean Region and  Anatolia  that characterised the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the  Greek Dark Ages .\nThe collapse of the Hittite Empire is usually associated with the gradual decline of Eastern Mediterranean trade networks and the resulting  collapse of major Late Bronze Age cities  in the Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean.At the beginning of the 12th century BC,  Wilusa  ( Troy ) was destroyed and the  Hittite Empire  suffered a sudden devastating attack from the  Kaskas , who occupied the coasts around the  Black Sea , and who joined with the  Mysians . They proceeded to destroy almost all Hittite sites but  were finally defeated by the  Assyria ns beyond the southern borders near the  Tigris .   Hatti ,  Arzawa  ( Lydia ),  Alashiya  ( Cyprus ),  Ugarit  and  Alalakh  were destroyed.\nIt is thought that the increase in piracy and raiding associated with the  Bronze Age collapse , possibly produced by the  Peoples of the Sea , brought the trading system of oxhide ingots to an end. It was only with the recovery of Phoenician trade in the 10th and 9th centuries BC that saw a return to prosperity, and the appearance of real coinage, possibly first in Anatolia with  Croesus  of  Lydia  and subsequently with the Greeks and Persians. In Africa, many forms of value store have been used, including beads, ingots,  ivory , various forms of weapons, livestock, the  manilla currency , and ochre and other earth oxides. The manilla rings of  West Africa  were one of the currencies used from the 15th century onwards to sell slaves.  African currency  is still notable for its variety, and in many places various forms of  barter  still apply.\nAt the end of the Bronze Age, the tin needed to make bronze could no longer be acquired With the collapse of the Bronze Age around 1200 B.C.E., trade networks fell apart. This had many consequences for Bronze Age civilizations. One of the most catastrophic was that they could no longer acquire the tin they needed to make bronze. Differences Between Iron and Bronze\nWith the mysterious end of the Mycenaean civilization during the Bronze Age Collapse around 1200 BCE (possibly through earthquake, invasion or in-fighting) came the so-called Dark Ages and it would be many centuries before Greek culture would finally regain the heights of the late Bronze Age.\nA 12th-century inscription describes Ramesses III\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defeat of the Sea Peoples. The Sea Peoples, a range of groups including the Philistines, led raids on the Eastern Mediterranean during the period of the Bronze Age collapse and are often cited as the reason for the collapse.", "key": "34_6", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.033934", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
