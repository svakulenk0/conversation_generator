{"input_text": "The idea that  Benjamin Franklin  preferred the turkey as the national bird of the United States comes from a letter he wrote to his daughter Sarah Bache on January 26, 1784. The main subject of the letter is a criticism of the  Society of the Cincinnati , which he likened to a  chivalric order , which contradicted the ideals of the newly founded American  republic . In one section of the letter, Franklin remarked on the appearance of the  bald eagle  on the Society's crest:\nContrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that  Benjamin Franklin  ever publicly supported the  wild turkey  (Meleagris gallopavo), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the  Society of the Cincinnati , he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior. In the letter Franklin states:\nThe  bald eagle  has inspired millions of Americans across the nation since June 20, 1782. The American Eagle Day was celebrated ideally for the recovery and restoration of this exclusive bird. On June 28, 2007, the Department of the Interior has taken the bald eagle off the endangered and threatened species list. In addition, these birds have become a national symbol. The second Constitutional congress decided upon using American bald eagles as the great seal of the United States. There were many disagreements with the choice of national symbol. For example, one of the  founding fathers ,  Benjamin Franklin  quoted, \"I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country, he is a bird of bad moral character...Besides he is a rank coward...\" He thought that the national bird should have been a  wild turkey , because it is \"A bird of courage\".  In contrast, John F. Kennedy stated, \"The Founding Fathers made an appropriate choice when they selected the bald eagle as the emblem of the nation. The fierce beauty and proud independence of this great bird aptly symbolizes the strength and freedom of America.\"\nMint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross had long been an admirer of Benjamin Franklin, and wished to see him on a coin. In 1933, Sinnock had designed a medal featuring Franklin, which may have given her the idea.  Franklin had opposed putting portraits on coins; he advocated proverbs about which the holder could profit through reflection. In a 1948 interview, Ross noted that Franklin only knew of living royalty on coins, and presumably would feel differently about a republic honoring a deceased founder.  Indeed, Franklin might have been more upset at the reverse design: as  numismatic  writer Jonathan Tepper noted, \"Had Benjamin Franklin known that he would be appearing on a half dollar with an eagle, he most likely would have been quite upset.  He detested the eagle, and numismatic lore has it that he often referred to it as a scavenger. Given the practical man that he was, Franklin proposed the wild turkey as our national bird.\"\nThe wild turkey is a native bird of North America. As a result, Benjamin Franklin claimed this made the turkey a more suitable national bird for the United States than the bald eagle.

The Indians used the feathers in ceremonies, and they twisted and plaited the feathers with twine to form blankets.\n1 After this, the congress was called the Congress of the Confederation. 2  In the First Continental Congress, Patrick Henry, a delegate from Virginia, made the bold statement that I am not a Virginian, I am an American.3  At the time of the congress, there were around 2.5 million people living in the United States.
