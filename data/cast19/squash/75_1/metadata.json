{"input_text": "Quercus laevis, the turkey oak, is a member of the  red oak  group of  oak s. It is native to the southeastern United States, occurring on the coastal plain from  Virginia  south to  central Florida , and west to southeast  Louisiana . The name turkey oak derives from the resemblance of the leaves to a turkey's foot. A  Turkish  and southern  Europe an species  Quercus cerris  is also commonly referred to as Turkey oak, so Quercus laevis is sometimes referred to as American turkey oak to distinguish it from the European species.\nThe common names for  Meleagris gallopavo  (the  wild turkey  of North America, but best known worldwide from the  domesticated turkey ), in other languages also frequently reflect its exotic origins, seen from a European viewpoint, and confusion about where it actually comes from. See  Turkey (bird)  for the  etymology  of the English name and the scientific name Meleagris.\nIn the early days of the  Europe an colonisation of  North America , the native  wild turkey  (Meleagris gallopavo) was confused with this species. This led to the  English  name of the American bird, since  Turkey  and  Guinea  were equally far-off and exotic places. The word meleagris,  Greek  for guineafowl, is also shared in the scientific names of the two species, although for the guineafowl it is the species name, whereas for the turkey, it is the name of the genus and (in an altered state) the family.\nThe book reveals that  turkeys  can tell us about cultural issues and reveal something about being American. The book is about the history of turkeys and it has turkey  recipes . The history of the bird has to do with such things as turkey bones found in 3700 BC and the  domestication  of turkeys into Europe by explorers of the  New World . The recipes are from the 16th through the 19th century. The book also talks about the efforts to stop the wild turkey from becoming  extinct .\nThe wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is an upland ground bird native to  North America  and is the heaviest member of the diverse  Galliformes . It is the same  species  as the  domestic turkey , which was originally derived from a southern Mexican  subspecies  of wild turkey (not the related  ocellated turkey ). Although native to North America, the turkey probably got its name from the domesticated variety being imported to Britain in ships coming from the  Levant  via Spain. The British at the time therefore associated the wild turkey with the country  Turkey  and the name prevails.\nThere are two theories for the derivation of the name \"turkey\" for this bird, according to  Columbia University  professor of  Romance language s  Mario Pei . One theory is that when Europeans first encountered turkeys in America, they incorrectly identified the birds as a type of  guineafowl , which were already being imported into Europe by  Turkey merchant s via  Constantinople  and were therefore  nickname d Turkey coqs. The name of the North American bird thus became \"turkey fowl\" or \"Indian turkeys,\" which was then shortened to just \"turkeys\".\nIn many countries, the names for turkeys have different derivations. Ironically, many of these names incorporate an assumed  India n origin, such as diiq Hindi (\"Indian rooster\") in  Arabia n countries, dinde (\"from India\") in  French , Indjushka (\"bird of India\") in  Russia , indyk in  Poland , and Hindi (\"India\") in  Turkey . These are thought to arise from the thought that  Christopher Columbus  had originally believed that he had reached India rather than the Americas on his voyage.  In Portuguese a turkey is a peru; the name is thought to derive from the eponymous country Per\u00fa.\nThe fact that the word turkey refers to both a country (Turkey) and a bird (turkey) in English is completely incidental. Turkey was not named after turkeys or vice versa. Tu \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 rkey is just the English version of the Turkish name Tuerkiye, t\u00c3\u00bcrkiye literally: Meaning land of The tuerk.

By the way Turks also mistakenly viewed this bird an animal of exotic east and named it Hindi, a reference to India.est Answer: The English name for Turkey is derived from the Medieval Latin Turchia (c.1369).

Turkey is low in fat and high in protein.\nAlthough the wild turkey, as a species, had nothing to do with the country of Turkey, it is certain that the word turkey derives from that land.
