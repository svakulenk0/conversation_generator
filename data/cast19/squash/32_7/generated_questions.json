The earliest known fossils of the great white shark are about 16 million years old. However, the  phylogeny  of the great white is still in dispute. The original hypothesis for the great white's origins is that it shares a common ancestor with a  prehistoric  shark, such as the  C. megalodon. C. megalodon had teeth that were superficially not too dissimilar with those of great white sharks, but its teeth were far larger. Although cartilaginous skeletons don't fossilize, C. megalodon is estimated to have been considerably larger than the great white shark, estimated at up to  and. Similarities among the physical remains and the extreme size of both the great white and C. megalodon led many scientists to believe these sharks were closely related, and the name Carcharodon megalodon was applied to the latter. However, a new hypothesis proposes that the C. megalodon and the great white are distant relatives (albeit sharing the family  Lamnidae ). The great white is also more closely related to an ancient  mako shark,  Isurus hastalis, than to the C. megalodon, a theory that seems to be supported with the discovery of a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae of the extinct  transitional species   Carcharodon hubbelli  in 1988 and published on 14 November 2012.
