{"input_text": "The longfin mako shark (Isurus paucus) is a  species  of  mackerel shark  in the family  Lamnidae , with a probable worldwide distribution in  temperate  and  tropical  waters. An uncommon species, it is typically lumped together under the name \" mako \" with its better-known relative, the  shortfin mako shark  (I. oxyrinchus). The longfin mako is a pelagic species found in moderately deep water, having been reported to a depth of . Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad  pectoral fin s of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the shortfin mako.\nThe biology of the longfin mako is little-known; it is somewhat common in the western Atlantic and possibly the central Pacific, while in the eastern Atlantic, it is rare and outnumbered over 1000-fold by the shortfin mako in fishery landings. The longfin mako's slender body and long, broad pectoral fins evoke the  oceanic whitetip shark  (Carcharhinus longimanus) and the  blue shark  (Prionace glauca), both slow-cruising sharks of upper oceanic waters. This  morphological  similarity suggests that the longfin mako is less active than the shortfin mako, one of the fastest and most energetic sharks. Like the other members of its family, this species possesses  blood vessel   countercurrent exchange  systems called the  rete mirabilia  (Latin for \"wonderful net\", singular rete mirabile) in its trunk musculature and around its eyes and brain. This system enables other mackerel sharks to conserve  metabolic heat  and maintain a higher body temperature than their environments, though whether the longfin mako is capable of the same is uncertain.\nCertain species of fish maintain elevated body temperatures.  Endothermic   teleost s (bony fish) are all in the suborder  Scombroidei  and include the  billfish es, tunas, and one species of \"primitive\"  mackerel  (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family  Lamnidae  \u2013 shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark \u2013 are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family  Alopiidae  ( thresher sharks ). The degree of endothermy varies from the  billfish , which warm only their eyes and brain, to  bluefin tuna  and  porbeagle shark s who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20 \u00b0C above ambient water temperatures. See also  gigantothermy . Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central  nervous system  processing, and higher rates of  digestion .\nWhile fins from many shark species are used in the trade, certain shark species have been identified over the centuries as supplying the tastiest and most succulent fins. The shark-like rays (the sawfishes and  shovelnose ray s) supply the highest quality fin. As observed by one of the leading treatises on shark trade, \"The ... fins ... from the white-spotted guitarfish [ Rhynchobatus  spp.] are considered to be most valuable. The preferred shark species for fins are  tiger ,  mako , sawfish,  sandbar ,  bull ,  hammerhead ,  blacktip ,  porbeagle ,  thresher  and  blue shark .\" The fins from the critically endangered sawfishes \"are highly favored in Asian markets and are some of the most valuable shark fins.\" Sawfishes are now protected under the highest protection level of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ), Appendix I, but given the great volume of the shark fin trade, and that detached shark fins are difficult to identify, it is unlikely that CITES protection will prevent sawfish fins from entering the trade.\nThe most significant longfin mako catches are by Japanese tropical longline fisheries, and those sharks occasionally enter  Tokyo  markets. From 1987 to 1994, United States fisheries reported catches (discarded, as this species is worthless on the North American market) of 2\u201312 tons per year. Since 1999, retention of this species has been prohibited by the U.S.  National Marine Fisheries Service   Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic sharks. Longfin makos were once significant in the Cuban longline fishery, comprising a sixth of the shark landings from 1971 to 1972; more recent data from this fishery are not available. The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable due to its uncommonness, low reproductive rate, and susceptibility to shark fishing gear. It has also been listed under Annex I of the  Convention on Migratory Species   Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding . In the North Atlantic, stocks of the shortfin mako have declined 40% or more since the late 1980s, and concerns exist that populations of the longfin mako are following the same trend.\nOf all studied sharks, the shortfin mako has one of the largest  brain:body ratios . This large brain size prompted New Zealand Sealife Australia and New Zealand senior curator Craig Thorburn of Auckland, New Zealand, and film-maker Mike Bhana to investigate the intelligence of the mako. From tests involving shape differentiation to electroreception tests and individual recognition, they discovered makos are fast-learning sharks, able to determine whether or not the researchers were threatening. The sharks involved in the study (while never the same individuals) after initial caution showed unique and never before seen behaviors, such as refusing to roll back their eyes during feeding and allowing themselves to be briefly restrained and touched while being offered bait. Shortfin makos also do not rely on electroreception when hunting, unlike the great white shark, based on tests involving wired fiberglass fish designed to emit weak electrical signals resembling real fish of similar size. Instead, they rely on smell, hearing, and most prominently, vision. The results this research were featured on a documentary presented by  Shark Week  in 1999 called \"The Mako Shark: Swift, Smart and Deadly\".\nThe shortfin mako shark is cylindrical in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits  countershading , with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally and white ventrally. The line of demarcation between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the shortfin mako shark, but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one lateral keel on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the makos from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus  Lamna .\nThe most common marine fish in the Sound include  porgy , butterfish,  winter flounder ,  summer flounder ,  windowpane flounder ,  fourspot flounder , northern and striped  sea robin ,  little skate , menhaden, Atlantic silversides,  black seabass ,  blackfish  (tautog),  cunner ,  bluefish , and  smooth dogfish . Frequently  Atlantic bonito  and  false albacore , both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore.  Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing.  Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations.  Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous.  Anadromous fishes include  striped bass ,  white perch , alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory  shad .  Although several shark species likely infrequently wander in and out of the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area.  These are the  sand tiger shark , the  sandbar shark , the  spiny dogfish  and the  smooth dogfish .\nIsurus is a  genus  of  mackerel shark s in the family  Lamnidae , commonly known as the mako sharks.\nShortfin mako sharks over  have interior teeth considerably wider and flatter than smaller makos, which enables them to prey effectively upon  dolphin s,  swordfish , and other sharks. An amateur videotape, taken in Pacific waters, shows a moribund  pantropical spotted dolphin  whose tail was almost completely severed being circled by a shortfin mako. Makos also tend to scavenge long-lined and netted fish.\n21.  Isurus oxyrinchus  (Rafinesque, 1809). Shortfin mako shark.\nThe shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), also known as the blue pointer or bonito shark, is a large  mackerel shark . It is commonly referred to as the mako shark, as is the  longfin mako shark  (Isurus paucus).\nA commonly referred to transition is the evolution of Isurus hastalis, the Extinct Giant Mako, into the  Great White shark , Carcharodon carcharias. There exist teeth that are believed to represent the transition between the two species. These teeth, from Carcharodon sp. are characterised by the wider, flatter crowns of the Extinct Giant Mako. However, they also exhibit partial, fading serrations, which are more pronounced near the root, and disappear towards the tip of the tooth - serrations being found in Great Whites but not Extinct Giant Makos.\nFamily  Lamnidae  \u2013 Makos, Mackerel sharks\nThe shortfin mako shark is the fastest species of shark. Its speed has been recorded at  with bursts of up to .  This speed aids in leaping, with heights of  approximately  having been recorded. These characteristics have made the shortfin mako a highly sought-after  game fish  worldwide. Some cases of shortfin mako jumping into a boat after having been hooked have been reported.\nMako fishing is a predominate activity around the world.  As one of the fastest species in the water they offer acrobatic flips, fast runs, and heavy fights that entertain anglers.  Traditionally the sharks are hooked through the use of  chum  and baitcasters however fly fishing for them has become more popular, particularly in  San Diego .  There one of 3 known worldwide mako rookeries is located.  A cottage industry of fishing in this rookery has emerged, specifically catch and release with charter operations out of Mission Bay  For many years the mass commercial boats hunted them for restaurant catch but through the efforts of many local fishing companies and national organizations like Orvis this has been deterred\nIn August 2004, a record  mako shark  was caught off the coast of Yarmouth during the Yarmouth Shark Scramble. It weighed  and set a new Canadian record. It is considered one of the largest mako sharks ever caught.\nShark meat is a  seafood  consisting of the flesh of  shark s. Its consumption by humans has been mentioned since fourth century CE literature. Several sharks are fished for human consumption, such as  porbeagle s, shortfin  mako shark ,  requiem shark , and  thresher shark , among others. Shark meat is popular in Asia, where it is often consumed  dried ,  smoked , or  salted . Shark meat is consumed regularly in Japan, India, Sri Lanka, areas of Africa and Mexico. In western cultures, shark meat is sometimes considered as an inferior food, although its popularity has increased in Western countries.\nThe shortfin mako shark is a fairly large species of shark. An average adult specimen measures around  in length and weigh from . The species is  sexually dimorphic , with females typically larger than males. The largest shortfin mako shark taken on hook-and-line was , caught off the coast of California on June 3, 2013. Larger specimens are known, with a few large, mature females exceeding a length of  and a weight of . The longest verified length for a Shortfin Mako, caught off of the coast of  France  in September 1973, was . It can attain bursts of speed up to . A specimen caught off the coast of  Italy  and examined in an Italian fish market in 1881 was reported to weigh an extraordinary  at a length of . Growth rates appear to be somewhat accelerated in the shortfin mako in comparison to other species in the  lamnid  family.\nWell-known species such as the  great white shark ,  tiger shark ,  blue shark ,  mako shark , and the  hammerhead shark  are  apex predator s\u2014organisms at the top of their underwater  food chain . Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.\n\"Mako\" comes from the  M\u0101ori language , meaning either the shark or a shark tooth. It may have originated in a  dialect al variation as it is similar to the common words for shark in a number of  Polynesian languages \u2014mak\u014d in the  K\u0101i Tahu  M\u0101ori dialect, mang\u014d in other M\u0101ori dialects, \"mago\" in  Samoan , ma'o in  Tahitian , and mano in  Hawaiian . The first written usage is in  Lee  and  Kendall's  Grammar and vocabulary of the language of New Zealand (1820), which simply states, \"M\u00e1ko; A certain fish\".  Richard Taylor's  A leaf from the natural history of New Zealand (1848) is more elaborate: \"Mako, the shark which has the tooth so highly prized by the Maoris\".In 1809,  Constantine Rafinesque  gave the shortfin mako the scientific name Isurus oxyrinchus ( isurus  means \"the same tail\", oxyrinchus means \"pointy snout\").\nLongfin mako sharks are  predator s that feed on small  schooling   bony fish es and  cephalopod s. Whether this shark is capable of elevating its body temperature above that of the surrounding water like the other members of its family is uncertain, though it possesses the requisite physiological adaptations. Reproduction in this species is  aplacental viviparous , meaning the  embryo s hatch from eggs inside the  uterus . In the later stages of development, the unborn young are fed nonviable eggs by the mother ( oophagy ). The litter size is typically two, but may be as many as eight. The longfin mako is of limited  commercial value , as its meat and fins are of lower quality than those of other pelagic sharks; it is caught unintentionally in low numbers across its range. The  International Union for Conservation of Nature   has assessed this species as  vulnerable  due to its rarity, low reproductive rate, and continuing  bycatch  mortality.\nThe  sister species  relationship between the longfin and shortfin makos has been confirmed by several  phylogenetic  studies based on  mitochondrial DNA . In turn, the closest relative of the two mako sharks is the  great white shark  (Carcharodon carcharias). Fossil teeth belonging to the longfin mako have been recovered from the Muddy Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of  Hamilton , Australia, and from Mizumani Group in  Gifu Prefecture , Japan. Both deposits date to the  Middle Miocene   epoch  (15\u201311 million years ago (Mya).\nThe shortfin mako shark feeds mainly upon  cephalopods  and bony fish including  mackerel s,  tuna s,  bonito s, and  swordfish , but it may also eat other sharks,  porpoise s,  sea turtle s, and  seabirds . They hunt by lunging vertically up and tearing off chunks of their preys' flanks and fins. Makos swim below their prey, so they can see what is above and have a high probability of reaching prey before it notices. In Ganzirri and Isola Lipari,  Sicily , shortfin makos have been found with  amputated   swordfish  bills impaled into their head and gills, suggesting swordfish seriously injure and likely kill them. In addition, this location, and the late spring and early summer timing, corresponding to the swordfish's  spawning  cycle, suggests they hunt while the swordfish are most vulnerable, typical of many predators.\nThe great white shark came into existence during the mid- Miocene  epoch. The earliest known fossils of the great white shark are about 16 million years old. However, the  phylogeny  of the great white is still in dispute. The original hypothesis for the great white's origins is that it shares a common ancestor with a  prehistoric  shark, such as the  C. megalodon . C. megalodon had teeth that were superficially not too dissimilar with those of great white sharks, but its teeth were far larger. Although cartilaginous skeletons do not fossilize, C. megalodon is estimated to have been considerably larger than the great white shark, estimated at up to  and . Similarities among the physical remains and the extreme size of both the great white and C. megalodon led many scientists to believe these sharks were closely related, and the name Carcharodon megalodon was applied to the latter. However, a new hypothesis proposes that the C. megalodon and the great white are distant relatives (albeit sharing the family  Lamnidae ). The great white is also more closely related to an ancient  mako shark ,  Isurus hastalis , than to the C. megalodon, a theory that seems to be supported with the discovery of a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae of the extinct  transitional species   Carcharodon hubbelli  in 1988 and published on 14 November 2012. In addition, the new hypothesis assigns C. megalodon to the genus Carcharocles, which also comprises the other megatoothed sharks;  Otodus  obliquus is the ancient representative of the extinct Carcharocles lineage.\nBased on analyses of observer data collected from 2005 to 2009, 22 shark species were observed captured in the Marshall Islands longline tuna fishery, with 80% of the shark catch representing five species:  blue shark ( Prionace glauca ), silky shark ( Carcharhinus falciformis ), bigeye thresher shark ( Alopias superciliosus ), pelagic thresher shark (A. pelagicus) and oceanic whitetip shark ( Carcharhinus longimanus ) (Bromhead et al., 2012). Based on 2009 observer data, sharks and rays compose about 18% of total catch by weight by the Marshall Islands longline fishery.   Elasmobranch  species composition is 30% blue shark, 13% silky shark, 10% mako shark, 9% oceanic whitetip shark, and 37% other combined sharks and rays. Bromhead et al. (2012) found that in 2009, the most recent year of available observer data, the fishery had discontinued the use of fishing gear and methods known to be employed to target sharks (using large pieces of fish meat as bait, and placing baited hooks near the surface by attaching branchlines to floats), which had been employed in previous years of the study period (2005-2008).  In 2011 the Marshall Islands adopted a law that prohibits targeting sharks and prohibits the retention of sharks (see  shark sanctuary ).\nISAF  statistics records 42 shortfin  attacks  on humans between 1980 and 2010, three of which were fatal, along with 20 boat attacks. This mako is regularly blamed for attacks on humans and, due to its speed, power, and size, it is certainly capable of injuring and killing people. However, this species will not generally attack humans and does not seem to treat them as prey. Most modern attacks involving shortfin mako sharks are considered to have been provoked due to harassment or the shark being caught on a fishing line. Sharks can be attracted to spear fishermen carrying a stuck fish, and may slap them with  cavitation  bubbles from a swift tail flick. Divers who have encountered shortfin makos note, prior to an attack, they  swim in a figure-eight pattern and approach with mouths open.\nShortfin mako sharks, as with most other sharks, are aged by sectioning vertebrae \u2014 one of the few bony structures in sharks \u2014 and counting growth bands. The age of shortfin mako, and therefore important parameters, such as age at sexual maturity and longevity, were severely underestimated until 2006 (e.g. claims of sexual maturity at 4\u20136 years, claims of longevity as low as 11 years), because of a poorly supported belief that shortfin mako sharks deposited two growth bands per year in their vertebrae. This belief was overturned by a landmark study which proved that shortfin mako sharks only deposit one band in their vertebrae per year, as well as providing validated ages for numerous specimens. Natanson et al. (2006) aged 258 shortfin mako specimens and recorded:\nDrifting FADs are widespread in the  Atlantic ,  Pacific  and  Indian  ocean  purse seine  fisheries. They catch over 1 million tons of tuna (nearly one-third of the global tuna total) and over 100,000 tons of by-catch in the vicinity of FADs as of 2005.  Skipjack  Katsuwonus pelamis,  Bigeye tuna  Thunnus obesus and  yellowfin  Thunnus albacares tuna are the three primary tropical tuna species that FADs target. Other fish include  albacore ,  dolphin fish ,  wahoo ,  blue marlin ,  striped marlin ,  mako shark ,  silky shark ,  whitetip shark ,  galapagos shark , mackerel, and   bonito .\nCommon threshers are well regarded by  sports fishers  as one of the strongest fighting sharks alongside the  shortfin mako shark  (Isurus oxyrhinchus), and are ranked as  game fish  by the  International Game Fish Association  (IGFA). They are pursued by anglers using  rod and reel  off California, South Africa, and elsewhere. Frank Mundus has called thresher sharks \"exceedingly stubborn\" and \"pound for pound, a harder fish to whip\" than the mako. Fishing for the common thresher is similar to that for the mako; the recommended equipment is a  rod and a big-game reel holding at least 365 m (400 yd) of  line. The ideal method is  trolling  with baitfish, either deep or allowing it to drift.\nDuring the three weeks following the policy's implementation, 66 sharks were caught. Almost 75 per cent of the sharks caught on drum lines were under the target three metre size. Of the 49 undersized sharks, nine were found dead on the hooks and 40 were released alive. Fisheries officers patrolling beaches in Perth and a contractor in the South-West killed 17 sharks longer than three metres. Figures released on 18 February by Fisheries Minister Ken Baston showed 95 per cent of sharks caught were tiger sharks \u2013 a total of 63 animals. According to the State Government's SharkSmart website, tiger sharks \"may only have been responsible for one shark bite in WA since 1980\". Two Mako sharks have also been found dead on the drum lines.\nIn 2008  Deadly 60  was commissioned, followed by the Live n Deadly offshoot, the aim of which was to inspire children to get outside and interested in wildlife and adventure; his live wildlife question and answer appearances attracted up to 14,000 people per event. In the \"Deadly\" programmes he searched for predators that were \"Not just deadly to me, but deadly in their own world\". He dived outside of the cage with  great white ,  bull ,  great hammerhead ,  mako  and  tiger shark s, caught  king cobra s,  black mamba s and lanceheads, had a  redback spider  crawl across his hand and was bitten by a  caiman  whilst searching for  anaconda  in an Argentinian swamp. The programmes were transmitted on  Nat Geo Wild ,  Animal Planet  and  BBC  to 157 countries worldwide. The fourth season of the series, Deadly Pole to Pole was filmed in 2013\u20132014 from the  Arctic circle  to  Antarctica , journeying south through the Americas. The scenarios included being hunted by a polar bear whilst kayaking in  Svalbard , filming feeding sharks and eagles using timeslice technology, exploring flooded caves and the insides of a glacier, and catching dozens of species of snake and crocodile. He was bitten by a shark but was saved by a chain-mail shark suit. The finale was diving underneath Antarctic icebergs alongside predatory  leopard seal .\nCarcharocles  proponents point out that the great white shark is closely related to the ancient shark  Isurus hastalis , the \"broad tooth  mako \", rather than to C. megalodon. One reason cited by paleontologist Chuck Ciampaglio is that the dental  morphometrics  (variations and changes in the physical form of objects) of I. hastalis and C. carcharias are remarkably similar. Another reason cited is that C. megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than C. carcharias teeth. Further evidence linking the great white shark more closely to ancient mako sharks, rather than to C. megalodon, was provided in 2009 \u2013 the fossilized remains of a form of the great white shark about 4 million years old were excavated from southwestern  Peru  in 1988. These remains demonstrate a likely shared ancestor of modern  mako  and great white sharks.\nThe family Lamnidae also includes the  great white shark  and the  porbeagle . Mako sharks are capable of swimming at speeds up to , and jumping up to  into the air. The  great white shark  is also closely related to an ancient mako shark, Isurus hastalis.\nShortfin mako sharks consume 3% of their weight each day and take about 1.5\u20132.0 days to digest an average-sized meal. By comparison, the  sandbar shark , an inactive species, consumes 0.6% of its weight a day and takes 3 to 4 days to digest it. An analysis of the stomach contents of 399 male and female mako sharks ranging from  suggest makos from  Cape Hatteras  to the  Grand Banks  prefer  bluefish , constituting 77.5% of their diet by volume. The average capacity of the stomach was 10% of the total weight. Shortfin mako sharks consumed 4.3% to 14.5% of the available bluefish between  Cape Hatteras  and  Georges Bank .\nThe range of  tiger shark  (Galeocerdo cuvier),  oceanic whitetip shark  (Carcharhinus longimanus) and mako shark ( Isurus ) includes the ocean around Tuvalu. The mako is known as rokea in the  Tuvaluan  language.\nIrrespective of the cause of their ultimate extinction, during the long time of their existence the pseudotooth birds furnished  prey  for large predators themselves. Few if any birds that coexisted with them were large enough to harm them while airborne; as evidenced by the Early Eocene  Limnofregata , the  frigatebird s coevolved with the Pelagornithidae and may well have harassed any of the small species for food on occasion, as they today harass albatrosses. From the Middle Miocene or Early Pliocene of the Lee Creek Mine, some remains of pseudotooth birds which probably fell victim to  shark s while feeding are known. The large members of the abundant Lee Creek Mine shark fauna that hunted near the water's surface included the  broadnose sevengill shark  (Notorynchus cepedianus),  Carcharias  sand tiger sharks, Isurus and Cosmopolitodus  mako shark s,  Carcharodon  white sharks, the  snaggletooth shark  Hemipristis serra,  tiger shark s (Galeocerdo),  Carcharhinus  whaler sharks, the  lemon shark  (Negaprion brevirostris) and  hammerhead shark s (Sphyrna), and perhaps (depending on the bird fossils' age) also  Pristis  sawfishes,  Odontaspis  sand tiger sharks, and  Lamna  and  Parotodus benedeni  mackerel sharks. It is notable that fossils of smaller diving birds \u2013 for example auks,  loon s and  cormorant s \u2013 as well as those of albatrosses are much more commonly found in those shark  pellet s than pseudotooth birds, supporting the assumption that the latter had quite low population densities and caught much of their food in mid-flight.\nThe fins are added for their texture. Not all sharks are edible. Most commonly consumed shark varieties are dogfishes, catsharks, sand sharks, makos, and smoothhounds. Mako fish is a delicacy for their meat is salmon-coloured having a very fine quality. Mako liver is used to prepare oil that is rich in vitamins. The skin of the shark is made into leather and the fins are added to shark fin soup. However, the meat can be eaten with its nutrient value only when cooked properly.\nFacts about Great White Sharks, Tiger Sharks, Bull Sharks, Whale Sharks, Bull Shark, Hammerhead Shark, Mako Shark and more. Sharks are a large group of fish that have inhabited the oceans for over 400 million years, even before dinosaurs populated our planet.\nAmong the most dangerous to humans are: Great white; Tiger shark; Bull shark; Oceanic White tip; Gray sharks (territorial?) Mako; Only a few species consider people as prey. They usually attack mistaking humans for marine animals on which they feed (mammals or sea turtles). Most of the other sharks attack are provoked (feeding, spearfishing, bleeding, etc.) Sharks don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many predators.\nShortfin mako shark. The shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), also known as the blue pointer or bonito shark, is a large mackerel shark. It is commonly referred to as the mako shark, as is the longfin mako shark (Isurus paucus).\nThe shortfin mako shark, I. oxyrinchus, is the better known of the two makos. The longfin mako shark, I. paucus, closely resembles the shortfin mako, and the two species swim in many of the same waters. The shortfin mako shark is likely the fastest swimmer of all sharks and one of the swiftest of all fishes.\nThe family Lamnidae also includes the great white shark and the porbeagle. Mako sharks are capable of swimming at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph), and jumping up to 7 m (23 ft) into the air. The great white shark is also closely related to an ancient mako shark, Isurus hastalis.\nFor other uses, see Mako shark (disambiguation). Isurus is a genus of mackerel sharks in the family Lamnidae, commonly known as the mako sharks. The two living species are the common shortfin mako shark (I. oxyrinchus) and the rare longfin mako shark (I. paucus).\nMako Shark. Mako Shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Isurus oxyrinchus. The shortfin mako shark also is known as the blue pointer and bonito shark. It is a fast speed-swimming shark that has been called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe peregrine falcon of the sharks\u00e2\u0080\u009d in allusion to the fastest bird in the world.\nMako shark. Mako shark (genus Isurus), any of two species of swift, active, potentially dangerous sharks of the mackerel shark family, Isuridae. The shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) is found in all tropical and temperate seas, and the longfin mako (I. paucus) is scattered worldwide in tropical seas.\nDescription & Behavior. Shortfin mako sharks, Isurus oxyrinchus (Rafinesque, 1810), aka makos, shortfins, short-finned makos, blue pointers, mackerel sharks, blue dynamites, bonitos, spriglios, palomas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are truly beautiful animals. They are well-adapted and active pelagic (open water) sharks.\nSome sharks are fast and some sharks are slow, but the great majority cruise at very low speeds. While great whites, blues, and makos are capable of a great speed burst, most sharks swim at around 1.5 miles per hour when they're not actively chasing prey or attempting to escape from a dangerous situation. This speed falls about in line with the average human swim speed, which is between 1 and 2 miles per hour.\nThey have numerous sets of replaceable teeth. Well-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and the hammerhead shark are apex predators\u00e2\u0080\u0094organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.\nToday, there are only two living species of Mako remaining. They are called the Longfin Makos and the Shortfin Makos. The largest is the Longfin with a length of about 4.5 meters (14ft) and adults weigh in around 170 kilograms (375 pounds). Shortfin sharks are usually about half this size and weight.\nThe mako shark has a very pretty dark blue color on top. It is white underneath which allows it to blend in and stay hidden when it is hunting for food. It has a unique nose that has a point to it like a cone. They are very big sharks in reference to their weight which can be up to 1,000 pounds.\nShark Week. The shortfin mako shark is the fastest shark in the ocean.

Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.\nSince then, sharks have diversified into over 500 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (39 ft) in length.hey have several sets of replaceable teeth.

Teeth have serrated edges, are close together. with overlapping bases on the upper front jaw. The new IGFA 528 lb. blue shark record is. going to be hard to beat.That shark is about at. maximum weight for a blue shark.\nSome common kinds of shark include the hammerhead shark, the great white shark, the tiger shark, and the mako shark.\nThe world's most dangerous shark is the Bull Shark. The world's biggest shark is the Whale Shark (a shark is a fish). The Whale Shark can be up to 53 feet long and weight more than 13 ton.(The Blue Whale is a mammal that is why it is not the biggest fish.).The world's fastest shark is the Mako Shark.he world's most dangerous shark is the Bull Shark.

Pelagic sharks are shortfin makos and whale sharks. Deep water sharks, such as catsharks, goblin sharks and megamouth sharks, stay in cold water all year round.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\nGenus: Mako sharks. Mako shark is better known as grey-blue shark.

Shark color can vary from grey-blue and blue to light gray, almost white. The predator has no swim bladder, and the only reason why it does not sink is because it is in constant motion throughout its life.The Mako sharks main diet consists of large marine fish: scomber, tuna, mackerel, herring and others.enus: Mako sharks.

This ancient order is called mackerel sharks, or Lamniformes, and includes a wide range of species from megamouths to makos, and threshers to goblin sharks.\nAnswer: In a race among the sharks, the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) would be the winner. The robust, streamlined shortfin mako shark is reported to have been clocked at 22 mph, although some sources say it can reach up to 60 mph.This may be because it is capable of chasing even quicker fish, the sailfish and swordfish, which can reach speeds over 60 mph (when leaping).The mako can also perform giant leaps of up to 20 feet out of the water.

This is also true of other sharks such as hammerhead, porbeagle, thresher, and blue sharks.lthough anglers can legally retain a 54 inch shortfin mako shark, both male and female shortfin mako sharks reach sexual maturity at sizes larger than 54 inches fork length (73 and 108 in fork length, respectively). This is also true of other sharks such as hammerhead, porbeagle, thresher, and blue sharks.\nWhale sharks are slow swimmers and their top speed is no more than 5 miles (8 kilometers per hour) probably due to the fact that whale shark is the biggest fish in the world. It reaches a length of 40 ft (12 m) and weighs up to 13 tons (12 metric tons).Great white sharks are one of the fast movers in water.ormally sharks swim at a speed of less than 5 kph but few species such as mako sharks are able to cruise at a speed of 48 kph.

Their teeth are moderately long, smooth-edged, without basal cusplets. Their gill slits are long, extending partially onto the top of their heads.\nLongfin mako sharks, Isurus paucus, likely feed on pelagic squids and schooling fishes. The diet of shortfin makos is relatively well known and includes a wide variety of teleosts (bony fishes) and cephalopods.\nBlue sharks eat a significant amount of squid, while tiger sharks are known to eat sea turtles. Smooth dogfish sharks eat crabs and lobsters, and hammerhead sharks prefer stingrays. Some sharks that are quick and large enough also hunt sea mammals. Great white sharks, tiger sharks and mako sharks have been known to eat sea lions, seals, dolphins, porpoises and sea birds. They also prey on large fish like mackerel and tuna. The largest shark, the whale shark, doesn't hunt for its food.\nThe mako shark, also called shortfin mako shark or blue pointer, is the fastest of all shark species, and can reach an average speed of 22 mph, though scientists have found one particularly spry specimen traveling at an astonishing 43 mph.\nWORLD\u00e2\u0080\u0099S BIGGEST SHARK.

On average, there are only about 100 shark attacks each year and only 10 of those result in a human death. You should check it out from their perspective, though! People kill thousands of sharks in a year for sport and for food. Shark skins are used to make products like any other leather would be. Up until the 1950's, shark livers were used as a vitamin A supplement. Shark fin soup and shark steaks are both eaten in many countries (Mako, seen in the top photo, is the most popular in the United States).\nWell-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and the hammerhead shark are apex predators\u00e2\u0080\u0094organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.\nMako sharks are the fastest of all sharks. A Shortfin mako has been reliably clocked at 31 mph (50 Km/hr), and is thought to have achieved even faster bursts of speed! For comparison, an Olympic swimmer can swim at speeds around 5 mph.\nIn the Miocene, the Isurus (Mako) genus branches into the modern mako shark sand the White shark lineage. Distribution: Great Whites are found globally in near-shore and off-shore temperate waters. Sometimes they can be found in tropical waters, but are not found in arctic waters.\n2.5 - 4.2 m (8 - 13 feet) Shortfin Makos are slightly smaller than Longfin makos. The largest Longfin mako accurately measured had a length of 13.7 feet. Diet: Fish. The diet of a Mako shark is almost entirely fish, smaller sharks, and sometimes squid.\nThe Cosmopolitodus genus (White Sharks) eventually leads into the Great White Shark, Carcharodon Carcharias. Also in the Miocene, the Isurus genus branches into the modern mako sharks, Isurus paucus and Isurus oxyrhincus.\nA question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. There are currently two species of mako recognized, the Longfin (Isurus paucus) and the Shortfin (I. oxyrinchus).\nMore on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n1. Shark. This means any type of meat eating shark such as Longfin Mako, Shortfin Mako, Blacktip, or common Thresher shark. Because sharks are at or near the top of the food chain, they consume other types of fish as their main source of food.\nNot surprisingly, Shortfin Makos are able to catch even the fastest of fishes  there is a record of a 750-pound (340-kilogram) Mako with a whole 120-pound (54.5-kilogram) Broadbill Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in its stomach; however, it is uncertain whether the shark out-sprinted or out-maneuvered the swordfish.", "key": "32_7", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:58.991946", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
