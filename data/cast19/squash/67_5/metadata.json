{"input_text": "Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a disorder characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), movement problems, increased susceptibility to infection, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function. The anemia in this condition begins in infancy. Since the anemia results from the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic anemia. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. When the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. The movement problems are caused by impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. This impairment leads to muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), tremors, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Affected individuals may also develop seizures. Weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. Individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells. These immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The most common infections in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. People with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often do not survive past childhood due to respiratory failure. In a few rare cases, affected individuals without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood. The deficiency is most commonly caused by mutations in TPI1, although mutations in other isoforms have been identified. A common marker for TPI deficiency is the increased accumulation of DHAP in erythrocyte extracts; this is because the defective enzyme no longer has the ability to catalyze the isomerization to GAP. The point mutation does not affect the catalysis rate, but rather, affects the assembly of the enzyme into a homodimer.\nThe most common causes of  microcytic anemia  are iron deficiency (due to inadequate  diet ary intake,  gastrointestinal blood loss , or  menstrual blood loss ),  thalassemia ,  sideroblastic anemia  or  chronic disease . In  iron deficiency anemia  (microcytic anemia), it can be as low as 60 to 70 femtolitres. In some cases of  thalassemia , the MCV may be low even though the patient is not iron deficient.\nA  complete blood count  may reveal anemia, which commonly is caused by blood loss leading to iron deficiency (a microcytic anemia) or by  vitamin B  deficiency (a macrocytic anemia), usually caused by ileal disease impairing vitamin B absorption. Rarely autoimmune hemolysis may occur.  Ferritin  levels help assess if iron deficiency is contributing to the anemia.  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  (ESR) and  C-reactive protein  help assess the degree of inflammation, which is important as ferritin can also be raised in inflammation. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation may be more easily interpreted in inflammation. Anemia of chronic disease results in a normocytic anemia. Other causes of anemia include medication used in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, like azathioprine, which can lead to cytopenia, and sulfasalazine, which can also result in  folate deficiency . Testing for  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  antibodies (ASCA) and  antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies  (ANCA) has been evaluated to identify inflammatory diseases of the intestine and to differentiate Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, increasing amounts and levels of serological antibodies such as ASCA, antilaminaribioside [Glc(\u03b21,3)Glb(\u03b2); ALCA], antichitobioside [GlcNAc(\u03b21,4)GlcNAc(\u03b2); ACCA], antimannobioside [Man(\u03b11,3)Man(\u03b1)AMCA], antiLaminarin [(Glc(\u03b21,3))3n(Glc(\u03b21,6))n; anti-L] and antichitin [GlcNAc(\u03b21,4)n; anti-C] associate with disease behavior and surgery, and may aid in the prognosis of Crohn's disease.\nThe diagnosis of hemolytic anemia can be suspected on the basis of a constellation of symptoms and is largely based on examination of a  peripheral blood smear  and a number of laboratory studies. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include those that can occur in all anemias as well as the specific consequences of hemolysis. All anemias can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased ability to exercise when severe. Symptoms specifically related to hemolysis include  jaundice  and dark colored urine due to the presence of  hemoglobin  (hemaglobinuria). When restricted to the morning hemaglobinuria may suggest  paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria . Direct examination of blood under a microscope in a  peripheral blood smear  may demonstrate red blood cell fragments called  schistocytes , red blood cells that look like spheres ( spherocytes ), and/or red blood cells missing small pieces ( bite cell s). An increased number of newly made red blood cells ( reticulocytes ) may also be a sign of  bone marrow  compensation for anemia. Laboratory studies commonly used to investigate hemolytic anemia include blood tests for breakdown products of red blood cells,  bilirubin  and  lactate dehydrogenase , a test for the free hemoglobin binding protein  haptoglobin , and the direct  Coombs test  to evaluate  antibody  binding to red blood cells suggesting  autoimmune hemolytic anemia .\nNutritional anemia refers to types of  anemia  that can be directly attributed to nutritional disorders.\nMacrocytic anemia can be further divided into \"megaloblastic anemia\" or \"nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia\". The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells. The megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes). The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e. unimpaired DNA globin synthesis,) which occur, for example, in alcoholism.In addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B deficiency include  peripheral neuropathy  and  subacute combined degeneration of the cord  with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology. Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and  glossitis .The treatment for vitamin B-deficient anemia was first devised by  William Murphy , who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease.  George Minot  and  George Whipple  then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the  vitamin B  from the liver. All three shared the 1934  Nobel Prize in Medicine .\nAnemia is often first shown by routine blood tests, which generally include a  complete blood count  (CBC) which is performed by an instrument which gives an output as a series of index numbers. A sufficiently low  hemoglobin  (Hb) by definition makes the diagnosis of anemia, and a low  hematocrit  value is also characteristic of anemia. Further studies will be undertaken to determine the anemia's cause. If the anemia is due to iron deficiency, one of the first abnormal values to be noted on a CBC, as the body's iron stores begin to be depleted, will be a high  red blood cell distribution width  (RDW), reflecting an increased variability in the size of  red blood cells  (RBCs). In the course of slowly depleted iron status, an increasing RDW normally appears even before anemia appears.\nSpherocytosis is an auto- hemolytic   anemia  (a  disease of the blood ) characterized by the production of spherocytes ( red blood cell s (RBCs)) or erythrocytes that are sphere-shaped rather than bi-concave disk shaped.  Spherocytes are found in all hemolytic anemias to some degree.  Hereditary spherocytosis  and  autoimmune hemolytic anemia  are characterized by having only spherocytes.\nThere are three main types of anemia: that due to  blood loss , that due to decreased red blood cell production and that due to increased red blood cell breakdown. Causes of blood loss include  trauma  and  gastrointestinal bleeding , among others. Causes of decreased production include  iron deficiency , a  lack of vitamin B12 ,  thalassemia , and a number of  neoplasms of the bone marrow . Causes of increased breakdown include a number of genetic conditions such as  sickle cell anemia , infections like  malaria , and certain autoimmune diseases. It can also be classified based on the  size of red blood cells  and  amount of hemoglobin in each cell . If the cells are small, it is  microcytic anemia . If they are large, it is  macrocytic anemia  while if they are normal sized, it is  normocytic anemia . Diagnosis in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL), while in women, it must be less than 120 to 130 g/L (12 to 13 g/dL), Further testing is then required to determine the cause.\nCongenital hypoplastic anemia (or constitutional aplastic anemia) is a type of  aplastic anemia  which is primarily due to a congenital disorder.\nDiamond\u2013Blackfan anemia (DBA), also known as Blackfan-Diamond anemia, inherited pure red cell aplasia and as inherited erythroblastopenia, is a  congenital   erythroid   aplasia  that usually presents in  infancy . DBA causes low  red blood cell  counts ( anemia ), without substantially affecting the other blood components (the  platelet s and the  white blood cell s), which are usually normal. This is in contrast to  Shwachman\u2013Bodian\u2013Diamond syndrome , in which the  bone marrow  defect results primarily in  neutropenia , and  Fanconi anemia , where all cell lines are affected resulting in  pancytopenia .\nIn  medicine  ( hematology ) microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) is a  microangiopathic  subgroup of  hemolytic anemia  (loss of red blood cells through destruction) caused by factors in the small blood vessels. It is identified by the finding of anemia and  schistocytes  on  microscopy  of the  blood film .\nFinch's research on how iron metabolizes in the blood helped with blood disorders characterized by either an excess or inadequate supply of iron in the blood stream, such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and also focused his work on further understanding  Erythropoiesis , a process by which red blood cells are produced. During a period in which little was known about iron-deficiency anemia, how often it occurred or the principles of iron metabolism, Finch made significant findings in his research at the University of Washington throughout his 60-year tenure using radioisotopes to measure the body's production of red cells and their life span. He was able to discover how iron is incorporated in hemoglobin, and was able to aid doctors in expanding their abilities from simply detecting iron-deficiency anemia to detecting different types of anemia in an increasingly accurate manner. Finch has published Scientific Journal articles specifically pertaining to Erythropoiesis and anemia such as Erythropoiesisin Pernicious Anemia (1953), Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia in the Adult (1957), The Diagnosing of Iron deficiency Anemia (1964), Pathophysiologic Aspects of Sickle Cell Anemia (1972), and Erythroid Marrow Function in Anemic Patients (1987). Additional articles included: The Effect of Erythroid Hyperplasia on iron balance (1988), and Intact Transferrin Receptors in Human Plasma and Their Relation to Erythropoisis in blood (1990). Transferrin , a blood plasma protein for iron ion delivery, was additionally a huge topic for Finch in the 1980s as seen in his publications from that time period. He researched and published studies on transferrin in the blood such as intact transferrin receptors in human plasma, human deferric transferrin's interaction with reticulocytes, the uptake and release of iron in human transferrin, rat transferrin and gene expression, the iron binding sites of human transferrin, its saturation, and clinical implications.\nSideroblastic anemia or sideroachrestic anemia is a form of  anemia  in which the bone marrow produces ringed sideroblasts rather than healthy  red blood cell s (erythrocytes). In sideroblastic anemia, the body has iron available but cannot incorporate it into  hemoglobin , which red blood cells need to transport oxygen efficiently. The disorder may be caused either by a  genetic disorder  or indirectly as part of  myelodysplastic syndrome , which can evolve into  hematological malignancies  (especially  acute myelogenous leukemia ).\nDecrease of hemoglobin, with or without an absolute decrease of red blood cells, leads to symptoms of  anemia . Anemia has many different causes, although  iron deficiency  and its resultant  iron deficiency anemia  are the most common causes in the Western world. As absence of iron decreases heme synthesis, red blood cells in iron deficiency anemia are hypochromic (lacking the red hemoglobin pigment) and microcytic (smaller than normal). Other anemias are rarer. In  hemolysis  (accelerated breakdown of red blood cells), associated  jaundice  is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin, and the circulating hemoglobin can cause  renal failure .\nAnemia of chronic disease as it is now understood is to at least some degree separate from the anemia seen in  renal failure  in which anemia results from poor production of  erythropoietin , or the anemia caused by some drugs (like  AZT , used to treat  HIV  infection) that have the side effect of inhibiting  erythropoiesis . In other words, not all anemia seen in people with chronic disease should be diagnosed as anemia of chronic disease. On the other hand, both of these examples show the complexity of this diagnosis: HIV infection itself can produce anemia of chronic disease, and renal failure can lead to inflammatory changes that also can produce anemia of chronic disease.\nIron-deficiency anemia, also spelled iron-deficiency anaemia, is  anemia  caused by a  lack of iron . Anemia is defined as a decrease in the amount of  red blood cell s (RBCs) or  hemoglobin  in the  blood . When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include  feeling tired , weakness,  shortness of breath  or poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms which may include:  confusion ,  feeling like one is going to pass out , and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably  pale . There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause.\nIron-deficiency anemia is characterized by the sign of  pallor  (reduced oxyhemoglobin in skin or mucous membranes), and the symptoms of  fatigue , lightheadedness, and weakness. None of the symptoms (or any of the others below) are sensitive or specific. Pallor of mucous membranes (primarily the  conjunctiva ) in children indicates anemia with the best correlation to the actual disease, but in a large study was found to be only 28% sensitive and 87% specific (with high predictive value) in distinguishing children with anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) <11.0 g/dl] and 49% sensitive and 79% specific in distinguishing severe anemia (Hb < 7.0 g/dl). Thus, this sign is reasonably predictive when present, but not helpful when absent, as only one-third to one-half of children who are anemic (depending on severity) will show pallor. Iron-deficiency must be diagnosed by laboratory testing.\nCongenital hemolytic anemia (or hereditary hemolytic anemia) refers to  hemolytic anemia  which is primarily due to  congenital disorder s.\nHemolytic anemia refers to an anemia, a low red cell count or hemoglobin count, that is due to the excessive destruction of red cells. Lytic means destruction, in this case the destruction of red blood cells.There are many different hemolytic anemias, and this group includes sickle cell anemia.Hemolytic anemias are much less common than iron deficiency anemia, but are nonetheless important, largely because of the terrible effects of sickle-cell anemia. The normal red blood cell lives between 90 to 120 days.here are many different hemolytic anemias, and this group includes sickle cell anemia. Hemolytic anemias are much less common than iron deficiency anemia, but are nonetheless important, largely because of the terrible effects of sickle-cell anemia.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 ANEMIA (noun). The noun ANEMIA has 3 senses: 1. a deficiency of red blood cells. 2. a lack of vitality. 3. genus of terrestrial or lithophytic ferns having pinnatifid fronds; chiefly of tropical America. Familiarity information: ANEMIA used as a noun is uncommon.\nBlood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion. Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells. Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.\nSome diseases of the red blood cells are inherited.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Hemolytic anemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular).\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Normally, red blood cells last for about 120 days before the body gets rid of them. In hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.emolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow is unable to replace the red blood cells that are being destroyed. Immune hemolytic anemia occurs when the immune system mistakenly sees your own red blood cells as foreign substances. Antibodies then develop against the red blood cells.\nmedical Definition of anemia 1: a condition in which the blood is deficient in red blood cells, in hemoglobin, or in total volume \u00e2\u0080\u0094 see aplastic anemia, hyperchromic anemia, hypochromic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, microcytic anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 compare oligocythemia\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells.

Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal range in human red blood cells is 11 - 15%.If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with MCV results to figure out what the cause of the anemia might be. It is mainly used to differentiate between iron deficiency anemia, in which RDW is elevated, and other microcytic anemias.ormal range in human red blood cells is 11 - 15%.

A vitamin B12 test measures the amount of vitamin B12 in the blood. The body needs this B vitamin to make blood cells and to maintain a healthy nervous system. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products such as meat, shellfish, milk, cheese, and eggs.Most people who eat animal products are not likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiency anemia unless their bodies can't absorb it from food. vitamin B12 test is used to: 1  Check for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. 2  Diagnose the cause of certain types of anemia, such as megaloblastic anemia. 3  Help find the cause of dementia or other nervous system symptoms, such as tingling or numbness of the arms or legs (peripheral neuropathy). 4  See if vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is present after a ...\nThere are several types of anemia such as iron deficiency anemia (the most common type), sickle cell anemia, vitamin B12 anemia, pernicious anemia, and aplastic anemia. Symptoms of anemia may include. fatigue, malaise, hair loss, palpitations, menstruation, and.\nRed blood cells are also known as RBCs, red cells, red blood corpuscles (an archaic term), haematids, erythroid cells or erythrocytes (from Greek erythros for red and kytos for hollow vessel, with-cyte translated as cell in modern usage).lood diseases involving the red blood cells include: 1  Anemias (or anaemias) are diseases characterized by low oxygen transport capacity of the blood, because of low red cell count or some abnormality of the red blood cells or the hemoglobin.\nAnemia is caused by low iron and low blood levels.

The most common form, which accounts for at least 60 percent of all cases, is sickle cell anemia. The other common forms are sickle-hemoglobin C disease and sickle beta thalassemia. Sickle cell anemia tends to be the most serious form of the disease. Q. I have heard of anemia. What is the difference between sickle cell anemia and anemia? Sickle cell anemia is a very severe form of anemia. Anemia is a commonly known condition that occurs when the body does not produce enough red blood cells. In sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells die off too quickly and are abnormally shaped like crescents, or sickles.\nTest Overview. A vitamin B12 test measures the amount of vitamin B12 in the blood. The body needs this B vitamin to make blood cells and to maintain a healthy nervous system. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products such as meat, shellfish, milk, cheese, and eggs.Most people who eat animal products are not likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiency anemia unless their bodies can't absorb it from food. Check for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. 2  There are several risk factors for this anemia, such as those who have had stomach or intestinal surgery, small intestine problems, or people with a family history of this anemia. 3  Diagnose the cause of certain types of anemia, such as megaloblastic anemia.\nCongenital normocytic anemia is caused by the breaking up of red blood cells. Sickle cell disease is a congenital disorder of red blood cells. The most common cause of the acquired form of normocytic anemia is a long-term (chronic) disease.Chronic diseases that can cause normocytic anemia include kidney disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroiditis.Some medicines can cause you to have normocytic anemia, but this does not happen often.t means you have normal-sized red blood cells, but you have a low number of them. The presence of normal-sized red blood cells tells your doctor that you have normocytic anemia rather than another kind of anemia. For example, when anemia is caused by having too little iron in your diet, you have small red blood cells.\nThe definition of anemia is a medical condition in which the blood does not have enough red blood cells or hemoglobin. A person who constantly feels weak and does not eat enough red meat is an example of someone who may be suffering from anemia.\nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts. Also, the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal.Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells.It helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, chest pain, weakness, and fatigue (tiredness).If you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body.he most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness).

If you have severe anemia, you may need a transfusion of blood that matches your type. When the body's production of red blood cells doesn't work right, anemia may be treated or cured with a transplant.\nAmong the types of anemia that can be inherited are: 1  Sickle-cell anemia. 2  People with sickle-cell anemia have a gene that causes the blood protein hemoglobin to form abnormally.ome people are born with genetic abnormalities that can cause certain types of anemia, including sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and Fanconi anemia.\nLow hemoglobin means that a person's hemoglobin level when measured, is below the lowest limits of normal for their age and sex (see above normal range of values). For example, a 19 year old male would have low hemoglobin if the detected blood value was below 13.6 g/dl.Another term frequently used in place of low hemoglobin is anemia, or the person is described as being anemic. Some of the more common causes of anemia are as follows:1  Nutritional (iron, folic acid, or vitamin B 12 deficiency [ pernicious anemia 2  ]).

Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the mild anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems. What Causes Anemia? There are more than 400 types of anemia, which are divided into three groups: Anemia caused by blood loss; Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production; Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells Anemia Caused by Blood Loss\nIron-deficiency anemia is anemia caused by a lack of iron. Anemia is defined as a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague, including feeling tired, weakness, shortness of breath, or poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms, including: confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes no\nAnemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin.

Some common causes of fatigue include: Anemia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When you have low red blood cell counts in your bloodstream, your body has to work harder to deliver oxygen to your cells, causing fatigue. Iron deficiency is also associated with fatigue. If you're diagnosed with anemia, then it's important to understand the cause in order to correct the problem. Bleeding from the colon or stomach are frequent causes of anemia in older adults. It would be prudent to investigate whether colon cancer at an early treatable stage could be the cause of new onset anemia and be cured. Monthly blood loss in menstruating women and frequent blood donations are other causes of anemia.\nWhat is anemia? Anemia is a condition that occurs when the amount of hemoglobin in a person's blood drops below normal. A decrease in hemoglobin is often associated with a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) and hematocrit.\nAnemia is a lower than normal red blood cell count or the lack of hemoglobin in your red blood cells, resulting in a wide range of symptoms. Anemia can cause fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, and a number of other symptoms. There are several different types of anemia, such as dietary deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia and megaloblastic anemia.\nAnemia. Anemia is a disorder that affects the red blood cells in your body, reducing the number of them or the amount of hemoglobin they carry. When there are less red blood cells than normal or if they are not functioning properly it can result in serious effects on your health.\nAnemia is when you do not have enough red blood cells. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin which is needed to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. There are several common blood tests that may be used to diagnose anemia. A red blood cell count can measure the number of red blood cells that you have. Hemoglobin can also be measured. These two tests are included in a complete blood count or CBC. A CBC can also tell the size of the red blood cells. Once anemia is suspected by either a low hemoglobin or red blood cell count, other blood tests may be done to see what kind of anemia you have. By checking an iron level and ferritin, your doctor will be able to tell how much iron you have in your body.\nSickle cell anemia.

Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body.nemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated.\n1 The major causes of this type are iron deficiency (low level iron) anemia and thalassemia (inherited disorders of hemoglobin). 2  If the red blood cells size are normal in size (but low in number), this is called normocytic anemia, such as anemia that accompanies chronic disease or anemia related to kidney disease. If the red blood cells size are normal in size (but low in number), this is called normocytic anemia, such as anemia that accompanies chronic disease or anemia related to kidney disease. 2  If red blood cells are larger than normal, then it is called macrocytic anemia.\nDefinition.

Anemia is a condition in which the amount of hemoglobin in the blood, or the number of red blood cells, is reduced to below-normal levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein found in red blood cells that aids the transport of oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues.\nCauses of anemia. Different types of anemia and their causes include: Iron deficiency anemia. This is the most common type of anemia worldwide. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by a shortage of iron in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without adequate iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. Without iron supplementation, this type of anemia occurs in many pregnant women. It is also caused by blood loss, such as from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer and regular use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, especially aspirin. Vitamin deficiency anemia. In addition to iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Additionally, some people may consume enough B-12, but their bodies aren't able to process the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also known as pernicious anemia. Anemia of chronic disease.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.\nIron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is a type of blood disorder. The red blood cells in your body contain hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout your body. Your body needs iron to build enough healthy red blood cells and keep your hemoglobin at the right level. If your body lacks the right amount of iron, you could become anemic. As a woman, it's not unusual to have anemia, especially when you're of childbearing age. Iron deficiency is by far the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy and accounts for 75 to 95 percent of all cases. But it's not the only cause: You could also develop anemia from not getting enough folic acid or vitamin B12, by losing a lot of blood, or from having certain diseases or inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia.\nAnemia. Anemia is a condition in which you body produces too few red blood cells or each cell contains too little hemoglobin.

Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.\nMedical Definition of anemia. 1  1: a condition in which the blood is deficient in red blood cells, in hemoglobin, or in total volume\u00e2\u0080\u0094see aplastic anemia, hyperchromic anemia, hypochromic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, microcytic anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia; compare oligocythemia. 2  2: ischemia.\nanemia [(uh-nee-mee-uh)] A condition in which the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen is decreased because of too few red blood cells in circulation or because of too little hemoglobin.\nAnemia is a general term that refers to a deficiency in red blood cells (the red blood cell count), or a deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood cells themselves. There are several types of anemias, and iron deficiency anemia is one of them.\nCauses of Canine Anemia. There are three general categories of anemia in companion animals: anemia due to blood loss (hemorrhagic or iron-deficiency anemia), anemia due to destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), and anemia due to insufficient production of red blood cells (aplastic anemia).\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Different types of anemia include: Anemia due to B12 deficiency. Anemia due to folate deficiency.\nRed blood cells at work. Hemoglobin is the protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide from your body, transporting it to the lungs for you to exhale. Red blood cells are made inside your bones, in the bone marrow.ome diseases of the red blood cells are inherited. Diseases of the red blood cells include many types of anemia, a condition in which your body can't produce enough normal red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen throughout the body.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms.More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion. Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells. Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia.lood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms.\nThe various causes of different types of anemia will be discussed in later chapters, but first it is important to consider what all anemias and people with anemia have in common. As stated earlier, anemia is the condition characterized by an abnormal decrease in the body's total red blood cell mass. There are two possibilities as to what happens then to the blood's physical properties. The first is that, as the mass of red cells goes down, so does the total volume of blood.\nMedical Definition of ANEMIA. 1. : a condition in which the blood is deficient in red blood cells, in hemoglobin, or in total volume\u00e2\u0080\u0094see aplastic anemia, hyperchromic anemia, hypochromic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, microcytic anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia; compare oligocythemia.2. : ischemia.. : a condition in which the blood is deficient in red blood cells, in hemoglobin, or in total volume\u00e2\u0080\u0094see aplastic anemia, hyperchromic anemia, hypochromic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, microcytic anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia; compare oligocythemia. 2. : ischemia.\nFull Definition of ANEMIA. 1. a: a condition in which the blood is deficient in red blood cells, in hemoglobin, or in total volume b: ischemia.. : a condition in which the blood is deficient in red blood cells, in hemoglobin, or in total volume\u00e2\u0080\u0094see aplastic anemia, hyperchromic anemia, hypochromic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, microcytic anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia; compare oligocythemia. 2. : ischemia.\nWhat is myelophthisic anemia? Myelophthisic anemia occurs when bone marrow wastes away (phthisis). What causes myelophthisic anemia? Myelophthisic anemia can be caused by a tumor that metastasizes (spreads) into the bone marrow, an inflammatory process (Tuberculosis, lupus etc.) or a lipid storage disease. Breast and prostate cancer are cancers that can commonly spread to the bones.\nAnemia facts. Anemia is a medical condition in which the red blood cell count or hemoglobin is less than normal. For men, anemia is typically defined as hemoglobin level of less than 13.5 gram/100 ml and in women as hemoglobin of less than 12.0 gram/100 ml.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion. Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells.\nDrugs associated with Iron Deficiency Anemia. The following drugs and medications are in some way related to, or used in the treatment of this condition. What is Iron Deficiency Anemia: Iron deficiency anemia is a decrease in the red cells of the blood caused by too little iron.\nInstead of being round or disk-shaped, the red blood cells can be oval. Vitamin B 12 deficiency anemia and folate deficiency anemia are the most common causes of megaloblastic anemia. Pernicious anemia is a subtype of B 12 deficiency.he condition is caused by one of the following: Vitamin B 12 deficiency caused by a lack of intrinsic factor in gastric (stomach) secretions--intrinsic factor is necessary for absorption of vitamin B 12. This type of B 12 deficiency anemia is technically pernicious anemia.\nWhat is anemia? Anemia is a condition that occurs when the amount of hemoglobin in a person's blood drops below normal. A decrease in hemoglobin is often associated with a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) and hematocrit. Hemoglobin is contained within RBCs and is necessary to transport and deliver oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia. Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body does not have enough iron. Iron helps make red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia. Red blood cells bring oxygen to the body's tissues. Healthy red blood cells are made in your bone marrow.", "key": "67_5", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.229740", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
