In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism.

In the 1920s,  Ronald Fisher,  J.B.S. Haldane  and  Sewall Wright  combined Darwin's theory of natural selection with statistical models of  Mendelian genetics, founding the discipline of population genetics. In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge population genetics, the observations of field naturalists on the distribution of species and sub species, and analysis of the fossil record into a unified explanatory model. The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as  Theodosius Dobzhansky  and  Ernst Mayr, advanced the understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work  Genetics and the Origin of Species  helped bridge the gap between genetics and field  biology  by presenting the mathematical work of the population geneticists in a form more useful to field biologists, and by showing that wild populations had much more genetic variability with geographically isolated subspecies and reservoirs of genetic diversity in recessive genes than the models of the early population geneticists had allowed for. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr emphasised the importance of subspecies reproductively isolated by geographical barriers in the emergence of new species. The paleontologist  George Gaylord Simpson  helped to incorporate  paleontology  with a statistical analysis of the fossil record that showed a pattern consistent with the branching and non-directional pathway of evolution of organisms predicted by the modern synthesis.", "qas": [{"id": "question_350", "question": "What is the modern synthesis?", "answers": [{"text": "The modern evolutionary synthesis is the outcome of a merger of several different scientific fields to produce a more cohesive understanding of evolutionary theory.", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_351", "question": "Who is George Gaylord Simpson?", "answers": [{"text": "In the 1920s,  Ronald Fisher,  J.B.S.
