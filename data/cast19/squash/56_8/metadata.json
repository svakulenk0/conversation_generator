{"input_text": "In a large population, \"intermarriages\" ( crossing ) would even out these variations and explain why species appeared constant, but  reproductive isolation  of a small sub-group could lead to  divergence  and  geographic speciation : \"animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances\", as in the various species he had seen of  Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises  and  mockingbird s, the  Falkland Fox  and the  Chiloe fox , the \" Inglish  and  Irish Hare \". What Darwin called \" inosculation \" would abruptly introduce a clear distinction between even the most closely related species, explaining the  rheas  which remained distinct species with overlapping territories.<ref>\nThe  evolution of sexual reproduction  as well as its maintenance, is another mystery in biology. The purpose of  sexual reproduction  is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (\ufb01tness disadvantage) in relation to  asexual reproduction .  Mating type s (types of  gamete s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of  anisogamy  (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy. It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary  mating system , and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism.  Charles Darwin  was the first to suggest that  sexual selection  drives  speciation  (the formation of  species ); without sexual reproduction it is unlikely that complex life would have evolved.\nRomanes's and Darwin's relationship developed quickly and they became close friends. This relationship began when Romanes became Darwin's research assistant during the last eight years of Darwin\u2019s life. The association Romanes had with Darwin was essential in Darwin's later works. Therefore, Darwin confided volumes of unpublished work which Romanes later used to publish papers. Like Darwin, Romanes's theories were met with skepticism and were not accepted initially. The majority of Romanes's work attempted to make a connection between  animal consciousness  and  human consciousness . Some problems were encountered during his research that he addressed with the development of  physiological selection . This was Romanes's answer to three objections to Darwin\u2019s  isolation theory  of speciation. These were: species characteristics that have no evolutionary purpose; the widespread fact of inter-specific sterility; and the need for varieties to escape the swamping effects of inter-crossing after permanent species are established. At the end of his career the majority of his work was directed towards the development of a relationship between intelligence and placement on an evolutionary tree. Romanes believed that the further along an organism was on an evolutionary standpoint, the more likely that organism would be to possess a higher level of functioning.\nIn 1858  Charles Darwin  and  Alfred Russel Wallace  published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's  On the Origin of Species  (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed  common descent  and a branching  tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of  natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from  animal husbandry ,  biogeography ,  geology ,  morphology , and  embryology .\nAdaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology, such as the different species of  Darwin's finches . The other is  speciation  (species-splitting or  cladogenesis ), caused by  geographical isolation  or some other mechanism. A favorite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of  cichlid   fish  in African lakes, where the question of reproductive isolation is much more complex.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s,  Mendel's  theory of inheritance and Darwin's theory of evolution by  natural selection  were joined in what was called the  modern evolutionary synthesis . This conjunction of theories also had a large impact on how biologists think about species.  Edward Poulton  anticipated many ideas on species that today are well accepted, and that were later more fully developed by  Theodosius Dobzhansky  and  Ernst Mayr , two of the architects of the modern synthesis. Dobzhansky's 1937 book articulated the genetic processes that occur when incipient species are beginning to diverge. In particular, Dobzhansky described the critical role, for the formation of new species, of the evolution of  reproductive isolation .\nWest-Eberhard was among the first scientists  to reexamine  Charles Darwin 's ideas in  The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex  about  sexual selection  and identify the key importance he gave to the \u201csocial competition for mates\u201d as a factor in evolution    and  speciation . She has noted how sexual selection can trap animals into  sexual reproduction .\nIt is widely appreciated that  sexual selection  could drive speciation in many clades, independently of  natural selection . However the term \u201cspeciation\u201d, in this context, tends to be used in two different, but not mutually exclusive senses. The first and most commonly used sense refers to the \u201cbirth\u201d of new species. That is, the splitting of an existing species into two separate species, or the budding off of a new species from a parent species, both driven by a biological \"fashion fad\" (a preference for a feature, or features, in one or both sexes, that do not necessarily have any adaptive qualities). In the second sense, \"speciation\" refers the wide-spread tendency of sexual creatures to be grouped into clearly defined species, rather than forming a continuum of  phenotype s both in time and space - which would be the more obvious or logical consequence of natural selection. This was indeed recognized by  Darwin  as problematic, and included in his  On the Origin of Species  (1859), under the heading \"Difficulties with the Theory\". There are several suggestions as to how  mate choice  might play a significant role in resolving  Darwin\u2019s dilemma .\nAn early attempt by  William Ernest Castle  to unify the laws of mendelian inheritance with Darwin's theory of speciation invoked the idea that species become distinct from one another as one species or the other acquires a novel mendelian factor. Castle's conclusion was based on the observation that novel traits that could be studied in the lab and that show mendelian inheritance patterns reflect a large deviation from the wild type, and Castle believed that acquisition of such features is  the basis of \"discontinuous variation\" that characterizes speciation. Interestingly, Darwin discussed the inheritance of similar mutant features but did not invoke them as a requirement of speciation. Instead Darwin used the emergence of such features in breeding populations as evidence that mutation can occur at random within breeding populations, which is a central premise of his model of selection in nature. Later in his career, Castle would refine his model for speciation to allow for small variation to contribute to speciation over time. He also was able to demonstrate this point by selectively breeding laboratory populations of rats to obtain a hooded phenotype over several generations.\nThe apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of  evolution  that  Charles Darwin  called it an \"abominable mystery\". However, the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin, and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as  Archaefructus , along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular  seed fern s, have been proposed as the  ancestors  of flowering plants, but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. Some older fossils, such as the upper  Triassic   Sanmiguelia , have been suggested. Based on current evidence, some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms in the  Triassic  period (245\u2013202 million years ago). Fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the Middle Triassic (247.2\u2013242.0 Ma) suggests an older date for their origin.  A close relationship between angiosperms and  gnetophyte s, proposed on the basis of  morphological  evidence, has more recently been disputed on the basis of  molecular evidence  that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other  gymnosperm s.\nCharles Darwin 's famous book  On the Origin of Species  (1859) offered an explanation as to how species  evolve , given enough time. Although Darwin did not provide details on how species can split into two, he viewed  speciation  as a  gradual process . If Darwin was correct, then, when new incipient species are forming, there must be a period of time when they are not yet distinct enough to be recognized as species. Darwin's theory suggested that there was often not going to be an objective fact of the matter, on whether there were one or two species.\nThe crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by  An Essay on the Principle of Population  (1798) by  Thomas Robert Malthus , Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a \"struggle for existence\" in which favorable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism. Darwin developed his theory of \"natural selection\" from 1838 onwards and was writing up his \"big book\" on the subject when  Alfred Russel Wallace  sent him a version of virtually the same theory in 1858. Their  separate papers  were presented together at a 1858 meeting of the  Linnean Society of London . At the end of 1859, Darwin's publication of his \"abstract\" as On the Origin of Species explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of  concepts of evolution .  Thomas Henry Huxley  applied Darwin's ideas to  human s, using  paleontology  and  comparative anatomy  to provide strong evidence that humans and  ape s shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the  universe .\nMany of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin's theory of evolution with  Mendel 's theories of inheritance and genetics. Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky , called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that \" Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs. Nevertheless, some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today:  Louis Pasteur , for example, opposed the theory of  spontaneous generation  with  biogenesis , an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on  chemical evolution  and  abiogenesis . Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for  adaptation  and speciation. He defined natural selection as the \"principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is preserved.\" The concept was simple but powerful: individuals best adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce. As long as there is some variation between them and that variation is  heritable , there will be an inevitable selection of individuals with the most advantageous variations. If the variations are heritable, then differential reproductive success leads to a progressive evolution of particular populations of a species, and populations that evolve to be sufficiently different eventually become different species.\n'Female Cosmetic Coalitions' is a conceptual approach linking (a)  Darwin's theory of evolution  by natural and  sexual selection , (b) research into  sexual signalling  by wild-living monkeys and apes, (c) the fossil record of  encephalization  in human evolution, (d) recent archaeological discoveries of  red ochre  pigments dating back to the speciation in Africa of Homo sapiens around 250,000 years ago and (e) modern  hunter-gatherer  ethnography. These seemingly divergent topics are brought together in a co-authored publication attempting to explain why the world today is populated by modern Homo sapiens instead of by the equally large-brained, previously successful Neanderthals. An account of exhaustive archaeological testing of the FCC theory, including robust debate between specialists, is '''this article''' published in the journal Current Anthropology in 2016.\nMegaevolution describes the most dramatic events in  evolution . It is no longer suggested that the evolutionary processes involved are necessarily special, although in some cases they might be. Whereas  macroevolution  can apply to relatively modest changes that produced diversification of  species  and  genera  and are readily compared to  microevolution , \"megaevolution\" is used for great changes. Megaevolution has been extensively debated because it has been seen as a possible objection to  Charles Darwin 's theory of gradual evolution by  natural selection .\nEarly in his career, Gould and  Niles Eldredge  developed the theory of  punctuated equilibrium , according to which evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly, alternating with longer periods of relative evolutionary stability. Although Gould coined the term \"punctuated equilibria\" the idea was first presented in Eldredge's doctoral dissertation on  Devonian   trilobite s and in an article published the previous year on  allopatric speciation . According to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar \"in the central logic of  Darwinian theory .\" Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was \"of great interest to biology generally,\" it merely modified  neo-Darwinism  in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before. Other biologists emphasize the theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been \"unexpected by most evolutionary biologists\" and \"had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology.\"\nHis most important publication was  Variation and Evolution in Plants , which combined  genetics  and  Darwin's  theory of  natural selection  to describe plant  speciation . It is regarded as one of the main publications which formed the core of the  modern evolutionary synthesis  and still provides the conceptual framework for research in plant evolutionary biology; according to  Ernst Mayr , \"Few later works dealing with the evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by Stebbins' work.\" He also researched and wrote widely on the role of  hybridization  and  polyploidy  in speciation and plant evolution; his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field.\nDarwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. His thinking changed from the view that  species formed in isolated populations only , as on islands, to an emphasis on  speciation without isolation ; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new  ecological niche s. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in  fancy pigeon  breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son  Francis ) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.\nAs well as Darwin, the Reverend  J.T. Gulick  also found Wagner's theories overstated. Gulick was apparently responding to  David Starr Jordan , who approved of Wagner's geographic speciation ideas in a paper which is often cited as providing early support of geographical speciation. Jordan later wrote a brief note of correction agreeing with some of Gulick's criticisms:\nAt approximately the same time,  Charles Darwin  developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small,  random variation s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms (\" speciation \").\nThe modern evolutionary synthesis is the outcome of a merger of several different scientific fields to produce a more cohesive understanding of evolutionary theory. In the 1920s,  Ronald Fisher ,  J.B.S. Haldane  and  Sewall Wright  combined Darwin's theory of natural selection with statistical models of  Mendelian genetics , founding the discipline of population genetics. In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge population genetics, the observations of field naturalists on the distribution of species and sub species, and analysis of the fossil record into a unified explanatory model. The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as  Theodosius Dobzhansky  and  Ernst Mayr , advanced the understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work  Genetics and the Origin of Species  helped bridge the gap between genetics and field  biology  by presenting the mathematical work of the population geneticists in a form more useful to field biologists, and by showing that wild populations had much more genetic variability with geographically isolated subspecies and reservoirs of genetic diversity in recessive genes than the models of the early population geneticists had allowed for. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr emphasised the importance of subspecies reproductively isolated by geographical barriers in the emergence of new species. The paleontologist  George Gaylord Simpson  helped to incorporate  paleontology  with a statistical analysis of the fossil record that showed a pattern consistent with the branching and non-directional pathway of evolution of organisms predicted by the modern synthesis.\nSpeciation is the  evolution ary process by which reproductively isolated biological populations evolve to become distinct  species . The biologist  Orator F. Cook  coined the term 'speciation' in 1906 for the splitting of lineages or \" cladogenesis ,\" as opposed to \" anagenesis \" or \"phyletic evolution\" within lineages.  Charles Darwin  was the first to describe the role of  natural selection  in speciation in his 1859 book  The Origin of Species . He also identified  sexual selection  as a likely mechanism, but found it problematic.\nBirds have  wing s which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the  extinct   moa s and  elephant bird s. Wings, which evolved from  forelimb s, gave birds the ability to  fly , although further  speciation  has led to the loss of  flight  in  flightless bird s, including  ratite s,  penguin s, and diverse  endemic island species of birds . The  digestive  and  respiratory system s of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins, and also members of the  duck family , have further evolved for  swimming . Birds, specifically  Darwin's finches , played an important part in the  inception of Darwin's theory  of  evolution  by  natural selection .\nThe modern understanding of evolution began with the 1859 publication of  Charles Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species . In addition,  Gregor Mendel 's work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of  genetics . Fossil discoveries in  paleontology , advances in  population genetics  and a global network of scientific research have provided further details into the mechanisms of evolution. Scientists now have a good understanding of the origin of new species ( speciation ) and have observed the speciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal  scientific theory  that  biologist s use to understand life and is used in many disciplines, including  medicine ,  psychology ,  conservation biology ,  anthropology ,  forensics ,  agriculture  and other  social-cultural  applications.\nSome modern experts such as  Ernst Mayr ,  Jerry Coyne  and  H. Allen Orr , argue that Wagner pioneered the idea of geographical speciation, and that Darwin had not appreciated it. However, Wagner's \"migration theory\" was based on a rather simple, Lamarckian idea of evolution. Wagner argued in letters to Darwin that the latter had missed a vital geographic component in understanding the evolution of new species. Darwin at first responded in a friendly way to these letters, and agreed that geographic isolation was important (although not the only cause of speciation), and pointed out that he had in fact dealt with geographic speciation in  The Origin of Species . Wagner in his later articles totally rejected the importance of natural selection. He again pointed out the importance of intercrossing in preventing divergence, and thus for geographic separation in allowing divergence. Wagner argued that Darwin had not understood this, although these ideas are present in  The Origin of Species .  Darwin found Wagner's increasingly hysterical tone and one-sided argument upsetting, and wrote across his copy of Wagner's 1875 paper \"most wretched rubbish.\"\nMicroevolution is a credibly observed scientific phenomenon. What Creationists do not believe in is Darwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s macroevolutionary extrapolation of microevolution. Unlike microevolution, there is no true scientific evidence for macroevolution, and, in fact, there is significant evidence against it. The distinction between microevolution and macroevolution is, therefore, an important one for those interested in the creation-vs.-evolution debate.
