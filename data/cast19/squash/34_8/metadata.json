{"input_text": "The  Bronze Age collapse  that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay, and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined, falling into the comparative obscurity of the  Third Intermediate Period of Egypt . The  25th dynasty  of  Nubian  rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC, and in 525 BC, Egypt fell under  Persian rule .\nThe Iron Age (c. 1300 \u2013 600 BC) was characterised by the widespread use of iron and steel. It is also an age known for the development of alphabets and early literature. It formed the last phase of  Pre-history , spanning the period between the  collapse of the Bronze Age  and the rise of classical civilisation. In Anatolia the dissolution of the Hittite Empire was replaced by regional  Neo-Hittite  powers, including Troad, Ionia, Lydia, Caria and  Lycia  in the west,  Phrygia , centrally and Cimmeria and Urartu in the north east, while the  Assyrians  occupied much of the south east.\nAfter 1180 BC, during the  Late Bronze Age collapse , the Hittite empire disintegrated into several independent  Syro-Hittite states , subsequent to losing much territory to the  Middle Assyrian Empire  and being finally overrun by the  Phrygians , another Indo-European people who are believed to have migrated from the  Balkans . The Phrygian expansion into southeast Anatolia was eventually halted by the Assyrians, who controlled that region.\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the name given by those historians who see the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age  as violent, sudden and culturally disruptive, expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Middle East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the  Dark Age  that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite  and  Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nAfter 1180s BCE, amid general turmoil in the  Levant  associated with the sudden arrival of the  Sea Peoples , and the  collapse of the Bronze Age  the empire disintegrated into several independent  Syro-Hittite  (Neo-Hittite) city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BCE. In the West, Greeks were arriving on the Anatolian coast, and the  Kaskas  along the northern Black Sea coast. Eventually  Hattusha  itself was destroyed around 1200 BCE and the age of Empires shifted to that of regional states as the Bronze Age transitioned into the Iron Age.\nThe 10th century BC started the first day of  1000 BC  and ended the last day of  901 BC . This period followed the  Bronze Age collapse  in the  Near East , and the century saw the  Early Iron Age  take hold there. The  Greek Dark Ages  which had come about in 1200 BC continued. The  Neo-Assyrian Empire  is established towards the end of the 10th century BC. In  Iron Age India , the  Vedic period  is ongoing. In  China , the  Zhou Dynasty  is in power. The  European Bronze Age  continued with  Urnfield culture .  Japan  was inhabited by an evolving  hunter-gatherer  society during the  Jomon period .\nThe Hittites () were an  Ancient Anatolian people  who established an empire centered on  Hattusa  in north-central  Anatolia  around 1600 BC. This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under  Suppiluliuma I , when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern  Levant  and  Upper Mesopotamia . Between the 15th and 13th centuries BC the  Hittite Empire  came into conflict with the  Egyptian Empire ,  Middle Assyrian Empire  and the empire of the  Mitanni  for control of the  Near East . The  Assyrians  eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire, while the remainder was sacked by  Phrygian  newcomers to the region. After c. 1180 BC, during the  Bronze Age collapse , the Hittites splintered into several independent \" Neo-Hittite \" city-states, some of which survived until the 8th century BC before succumbing to the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age , expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Near East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BCE. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite   Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BCE, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nThe  Arameans  were a Northwest Semitic semi-nomadic and pastoralist people who originated in what is now modern Syria (Biblical Aram) during the Late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. Large groups migrated to Mesopotamia, where they intermingled with the native Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) population. The Aramaeans never had a unified empire; they were divided into independent kingdoms all across the Near East. After the Bronze Age collapse, their political influence was confined to a number of Syro-Hittite states, which were entirely absorbed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the 8th century BC.\nThe city became one of the most important centres in the Hittite Empire, during the Late Bronze Age, and reached its apogee around the 11th century BC.  While the Hittite empire fell to the  Sea Peoples  during the  Bronze Age collapse , Carchemish survived the Sea People's attacks to continue to be  the capital of an important  Neo-Hittite  kingdom in the  Iron Age , and a trading center. Although Ramesses III states in an inscription dating to his 8th Year from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple that Carchemish was destroyed by the Sea Peoples, the city evidently survived the onslaught. King Kuzi-Tesup I is attested in power here and was the son of  Talmi-Teshub  who was a contemporary of the last Hittite king,  Suppiluliuma II . He and his successors ruled a \"mini-empire\" stretching from Southeast Asia Minor to Northern Syria and the West bend of the Euphrates under the title \"Great King\". This suggests that Kuzi-Tesub saw himself as the true heir of the line of the great Suppiliuma I and that the central dynasty at Hattusa was now defunct. This powerful polity lasted from c.1175 to 975 BC when it began losing control of its farther possessions and became gradually a more local city state centered around Carchemish.\nWidely considered to be one of the  cradles of civilization  by the  Western world ,  Bronze Age , Mesopotamia included  Sumer  and the  Akkadian ,  Babylonia n, and  Assyria n empires, all native to the territory of modern-day Iraq. In the  Iron Age , it was controlled by the  Neo-Assyrian  and  Neo-Babylonian Empire s.\nAssyria was a major  Mesopotamia n  East Semitic-speaking  kingdom and  empire  of the  ancient Near East . It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC, until its collapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the  Early  to  Middle Bronze Age  through to the late  Iron Age .\nIn Egypt, Ramesses III was fighting to save his country and Empire in the midst of the Bronze Age collapse, a prolonged period of region-wide droughts, crop failures, depopulation, and collapse of urban centers.  It is likely that the Nile irrigated lands remained fruitful and would have been highly desirable to Egypt\u2019s neighbors. During this chaotic time, a new warlike group of people from the north, the Sea People, repeatedly attacked and plundered various Near Eastern powers.\nThe region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and  civilization . During the Early and Middle  Bronze Age , independent  Canaan ite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt,  Mesopotamia ,  Phoenicia ,  Minoan  Crete, and Syria. During  Late Bronze Age  1550\u20131400  BCE , the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian  New Kingdom  who held power until the 1178 BCE  Battle of Djahy (Canaan)  during the wider  Bronze Age collapse . Modern archaeologists dispute parts of the Biblical tradition, the latest thinking being that the Israelites emerged from a dramatic social transformation that took place in the people of the central hill country of Canaan around 1200 BCE, with no signs of violent invasion or even of peaceful infiltration of a clearly defined ethnic group from elsewhere. The  Philistines , part of  Sea Peoples  of Southern Europe, arrived and mingled with the local population, and according to Biblical tradition, the  United Kingdom of Israel  was established in 1020 BCE and split within a century to form the northern  Kingdom of Israel , and the southern  Kingdom of Judah . The region became part of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire  from c. 740 BCE, which was itself replaced by the  Neo-Babylonian Empire  in c. 627 BCE. A war with Egypt culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonian king  Nebuchadnezzar II  and the local leaders were  deported to Babylonia , only to be allowed to return under the  Achaemenid Empire .\nThe Hittites, who established an extensive empire in the  Middle East  in the 2nd millennium BCE, are by far the best known members of the Anatolian group. The history of the Hittite civilization is known mostly from  cuneiform  texts found in the area of their kingdom, and from diplomatic and commercial correspondence found in various archives in  Egypt  and the  Middle East . Despite the use of Hatti for their core territory, the Hittites should be distinguished from the  Hattians , an earlier people who inhabited the same region (until the beginning of the 2nd millennium). The Hittite military made successful use of  chariot s. Although belonging to the  Bronze Age , they were the forerunners of the  Iron Age , developing the manufacture of  iron  artifacts from as early as the 14th century, when letters to foreign rulers reveal the latter's demand for iron goods. The Hittite empire reached its height during the mid-14th century under  Suppiluliuma I , when it encompassed an area that included most of  Asia Minor  as well as parts of the northern  Levant  and  Upper Mesopotamia . After 1180 BCE, amid the  Bronze Age Collapse  in the  Levant  associated with the sudden arrival of the  Sea Peoples , the kingdom disintegrated into several independent \" Neo-Hittite \" city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BCE. The lands of the Anatolian peoples were successively invaded by a number of peoples and empires at high frequency: the  Phrygians ,  Bithynians ,  the  Medes , the  Persians , the  Greeks , the  Galatian Celts ,  Romans  and the  Oghuz Turks . Many of these invaders settled in Anatolia, in some cases causing the extinction of the Anatolian languages. By the  Middle Ages , all the Anatolian languages (and the cultures accompanying them) were extinct, although there may be lingering influences on the modern inhabitants of Anatolia, most notably  Armenians .\nMeli-Shipak II  (1188\u20131172 BC) seems to have had a peaceful reign. Despite not being able to regain northern Babylonia from Assyria, no further territory was lost, Elam did not threaten, and the  Late Bronze Age collapse  now affecting the  Levant ,  Canaan ,  Egypt , the  Caucasus , Anatolia,  Mediterranean ,  North Africa  and  Balkans  seemed to have little impact on Babylonia (or indeed Assyria).\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse was a  Dark Age  transition period in the  Aegean Region ,  Southwestern Asia  and the  Eastern Mediterranean  from the Late  Bronze Age  to the Early  Iron Age  that historians believe was violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. The  palace economy  of the Aegean Region and  Anatolia  that characterised the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the  Greek Dark Ages .\nThe collapse of the Hittite Empire is usually associated with the gradual decline of Eastern Mediterranean trade networks and the resulting  collapse of major Late Bronze Age cities  in the Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean.At the beginning of the 12th century BC,  Wilusa  ( Troy ) was destroyed and the  Hittite Empire  suffered a sudden devastating attack from the  Kaskas , who occupied the coasts around the  Black Sea , and who joined with the  Mysians . They proceeded to destroy almost all Hittite sites but  were finally defeated by the  Assyria ns beyond the southern borders near the  Tigris .   Hatti ,  Arzawa  ( Lydia ),  Alashiya  ( Cyprus ),  Ugarit  and  Alalakh  were destroyed.\nHLuwian appears as early as the 14th century BC in names and titles on seals and sealings at Hattusas. Texts first appear in the 13th century. Payne refers to the Bronze Age HLuwian as Empire Luwian. All Hittite and CLuwian came to an end at 1200, but the concept of a \"fall\" of the Hittite Empire must be tempered in regard to the south, where the civilization of a number of  Syro-Hittite states  went on uninterrupted, using HLuwian, which Payne calls Iron-Age Luwian and dates 1000\u2013700 BC. Presumably these autonomous \"Neo-Hittite\"\" heads of state no longer needed to report to Hattusas. These states using HLuwian disappeared at the  Late Bronze Age collapse  about 1200 BC. HLuwian caches come from ten city states in northern Syria and southern Anatolia:  Cilicia ,  Charchamesh ,  Tell Akhmar ,  Maras ,  Malatya ,  Commagene ,  Amuq ,  Aleppo ,  Hama , and  Tabal .\nAssyria was a major Mesopotamian kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East and the Levant. It existed as a state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its collapse between 612 BC and 609 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. From the end of the seventh century BC to the mid-seventh century AD, it survived as a geopolitical entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although a number of Neo-Assyrian st\nWidely considered to be the cradle of civilization by the Western world, Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires, all native to the territory of modern-day Iraq.
