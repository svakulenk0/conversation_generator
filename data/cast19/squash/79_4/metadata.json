{"input_text": "In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar 's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to  Raipur  in 1877. In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the  Presidency College  entrance examination.  He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the  Vedas , the  Upanishads , the  Bhagavad Gita , the  Ramayana , the  Mahabharata  and the  Puranas . Narendra was trained in  Indian classical music , and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the  General Assembly's Institution  (now known as the Scottish Church College). In 1881 he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of  David Hume ,  Immanuel Kant ,  Johann Gottlieb Fichte ,  Baruch Spinoza ,  Georg W. F. Hegel ,  Arthur Schopenhauer ,  Auguste Comte ,  John Stuart Mill  and  Charles Darwin . He became fascinated with the  evolutionism  of  Herbert Spencer  and corresponded with him, translating Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature.  William Hastie  (principal of General Assembly's Institution) wrote, \"Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students' Some accounts have called Narendra a shrutidhara (a person with a prodigious memory).\nThe  naturalism  of  natural selection  conflicted with presumptions of  purpose in nature  and while this could be reconciled by  theistic evolution , other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable.  Herbert Spencer  had already incorporated  Lamarckism  into his popular philosophy of progressive  free market  human society. He popularised the terms evolution and  survival of the fittest , and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.\nThe early sociology of  Herbert Spencer  came about broadly as a reaction to Comte.  Writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms (although Spencer was a proponent of  Lamarckism  rather than Darwinism).\nIn the play, the use of the expression \"survival of the fittest\" is attributed to Darwin; in reality it was first coined by  Herbert Spencer  in his Principals of Biology (1864).\nHerbert Spencer  (1820\u20131903), the English philosopher, was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the  Darwinian revolution  in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before  Darwin  published anything on the subject. Encouraged by his friend and follower  Edward L. Youmans , Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term \"sociology\" in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal  International Monthly ,  Franklin H. Giddings  (1855\u20131931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that \"first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest\" in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States,  Charles Horton Cooley , stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology \"probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since.\" It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including  \u00c9mile Durkheim , defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim\u2019s  Division of Labour in Society  is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable  biologist , Spencer coined the term \" survival of the fittest \" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a  laissez-faire  style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the  United States  and  England . Although Spencer's work is rarely discussed in contemporary sociological theory, his work has been adapted and changed, and resurfaces in various contemporary forms.\nThe early sociology of  Herbert Spencer  came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms.\nThe word evolution is forever associated in the popular mind with  Charles Darwin \u2019s  Theory of Evolution , which professes, among other things, that man as a species developed diachronically from some ancestor among the  Primate s who was also ancestor to the  Great Apes , as they are popularly termed, and yet this term was not a  neologism  of Darwin\u2019s. He took it from the cultural milieu, where it meant etymologically \u201cunfolding\u201d of something heterogeneous and complex from something simpler and more homogeneous.  Herbert Spencer , a contemporary of Darwin, applied the term to the universe, including philosophy and what Tylor would later call culture. This view of the universe was generally termed evolutionism, while its exponents were evolutionists.\nPositivism arrived in Britain well after science's lead had departed.  British positivism, found in  Victorian  ethics of  utilitarianism , for instance  J S Mill 's, and later in the  social evolutionism  of  Herbert Spencer , associated science with moral improvement, but rejected science as political leadership.  For Mill, all explanations held the same logical structure\u2014thus, society could be explained by natural laws\u2014yet Mill criticized \"scientific politics\".  From its outset, then, sociology was pulled between moral reform versus administrative policy.\nHerbert Spencer  (27 April 1820 \u2013 8 December 1903) was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including  \u00c9mile Durkheim , defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's  Division of Labour in Society  is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable  biologist , Spencer coined the term \" survival of the fittest \". While Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a  laissez-faire  style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the  United States  and  England .\nClassical social evolutionism is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte and of Herbert Spencer (coiner of the phrase \" survival of the fittest \"). In many ways, Spencer's theory of \" cosmic evolution \" has much more in common with the works of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of Charles Darwin. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as social evolutionism. Although he wrote that societies over time progressedand that progress was accomplished through competitionhe stressed that the individual rather than the  collectivity  is the  unit of analysis  that evolves; that, in other words, evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon. Nonetheless, the publication of Darwin's works proved a boon to the proponents of sociocultural evolution, who saw the ideas of biological evolution as an attractive explanation for many questions about the development of society.\nA course entitled \"sociology\" was taught for the first time in the United States in 1875 by  William Graham Sumner , drawing upon the thought of Comte and  Herbert Spencer  rather than the work of Durkheim. In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the  University of Kansas , lectured by  Frank Blackmar . The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 and the first full-fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the  University of Chicago  by  Albion W. Small  (1854\u20131926), who in 1895 founded the  American Journal of Sociology . American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology.  George Herbert Mead  and  Charles H. Cooley  were influential in the development of  symbolic interactionism  and  social psychology  at the University of Chicago, while  Lester Ward  emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883.\nThe Scottish philosopher and evolutionist  Herbert Spencer , who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.He wrote to a friend, \"I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived.\"He wrote, \"The  births, deaths,  and  marriages of  kings, and other like  historic trivialities, are  committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but  because society considers them parts of  a good education.\"In his essay What  Knowledge Is of Most Worth? he wrote:\nHerbert Spencer  was a 19th-century English philosopher who developed ideas about the unifying concept of evolution across the natural and social sciences. Spencer is the first to develop a theory of  cultural evolution  and is considered by some to be the father of  Social Darwinism . It is also he and not Darwin who coined the phrase  survival of the fittest . Much of the  positivist  ideas of progress that dominated the social science philosophy of Spencer and subsequent Social Darwinists has been criticized by present-day  sociologists , but such ideas continue to be one of the major critiques made by creationists against evolution in general, even though strict biological evolution does not depend on it nor offer any type of endorsement of so-called \"social Darwinism\" or its derivative philosophies such as  eugenics .\nPrus'  metaphor  of  society -as- organism , which he uses implicitly in \"Mold of the Earth\" and explicitly in the introduction to his novel  Pharaoh , was borrowed from the  sociological  writings of  Herbert Spencer , who had invented the expression \" survival of the fittest \" and exerted the greatest influence on Prus' thinking.\nLeading intellectuals also shaped the progressive mentality. In Dynamic Sociology (1883)  Lester Frank Ward  laid out the philosophical foundations of the Progressive movement and attacked the  laissez-faire  policies advocated by  Herbert Spencer  and  William Graham Sumner . In  The Theory of the Leisure Class  (1899),  Thorstein Veblen  attacked the \"conspicuous consumption\" of the wealthy. Educator  John Dewey  emphasized a child-centered philosophy of pedagogy, known as  progressive education , which affected schoolrooms for three generations.\nA broad historical paradigm in both sociology and  anthropology , functionalism addresses the  social structure , referred to as  social organization  in among the classical theorists, as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by  Herbert Spencer ) is to regard  norm s and  institution s as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as  Marcel Mauss ,  Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski  and  Radcliffe-Brown . It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of  social evolutionism , in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As  Giddens  states: \"Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects).\"\nJohn Stuart Mill ,  Auguste Comte , and  Herbert Spencer  appear among the influences on the English historical economists. The second half of  Queen Victoria's  reign saw the triumph of  evolutionary  concepts in the  sciences   ( geology ,  biology , and  sociology ) and a transition from a \" coal  and  iron \" based  manufacturing  economy to one based on  communication ,  urbanization ,  finance , and  empire .  The rise of  the historical school of jurisprudence  provided  \"allies in the struggle against the dominance of the abstract theory.\" Historical economists viewed  classical  and  neoclassical economics  as too formal and as a rationalization of free-trade policies in a  colonial  and  imperial  setting.\nWard is most often remembered for his relentless attack on  Herbert Spencer  and his theories of  laissez-faire  and  survival of the fittest  that totally dominated socio/economic thought in the United States after the  American Civil War . While Marx and communism/socialism didn't catch on in the United States during Ward's lifetime, Spencer became famous: he was the leading light for conservatives. Ward placed himself in direct opposition to Spencer and Spencer's American disciple,  William Graham Sumner , who had become the most well known and widely read American sociologist by single-mindedly promoting the principles of laissez-faire. To quote the historian  Henry Steele Commager : \"Ward was the first major scholar to attack this whole system of negativist and absolutist sociology and he remains the ablest.... Before Ward could begin to formulate that science of society which he hoped would inaugurate an era of such progress as the world had not yet seen, he had to destroy the superstitions that still held domain over the mind of his generation. Of these, laissez-faire was the most stupefying, and it was on the doctrine of laissez-faire that he trained his heaviest guns. The work of demolition performed in Dynamic Sociology, Psychic Factors and Applied Sociology was thorough.\"\nIn 1880, Sumner was involved in one of the first cases of academic freedom. Sumner and the Yale president at the time,  Noah Porter , did not agree on the use of  Herbert Spencer 's \"Study of Sociology\" as part of the curriculum. Spencer's application of supposed \"Darwinist\" ideas to the realm of humans may have been slightly too controversial at this time of curriculum reform. On the other hand, even if Spencer's ideas were not generally accepted, it is clear that his social ideas influenced Sumner in his written works.\nBeginning in 1880, Thomas studied literature and  classics  at the University of Tennessee, where he obtained a  B.A.  degree in 1884 and became Adjunct Professor in English and Modern Languages. While at Knoxville, Thomas also taught courses in  Greek ,  Latin ,  French ,  German , and  Natural history . At the same time, he developed an interest in  ethnology  and social science after reading  Herbert Spencer 's Principles of Sociology.\nThe term \"classical social evolutionism\" is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer (who coined the phrase \" survival of the fittest \") and  William Graham Sumner . In many ways Spencer's theory of ' cosmic evolution ' has much more in common with the works of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of  Charles Darwin . Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the  individual  (rather than the  collectivity ) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon.\nEcology is not just biological, but a human science as well. An early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was  Herbert Spencer . Spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer coined the phrase \" survival of the fittest \", he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism, and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology.\nSpencer influenced literature inasmuch as many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work.  George Eliot ,  Leo Tolstoy ,  Thomas Hardy ,  George Bernard Shaw ,  Boles\u0142aw Prus ,  Abraham Cahan ,  D. H. Lawrence ,  Machado de Assis ,  Richard Austin Freeman , and  Jorge Luis Borges  all referenced Spencer.  Arnold Bennett  greatly praised First Principles, and the influence it had on Bennett may be seen in his many novels.  Jack London  went so far as to create a character,  Martin Eden , a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested that the character of Vershinin in  Anton Chekhov 's play  The Three Sisters  is a dedicated Spencerian.  H.G. Wells  used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella,  The Time Machine , employing them to explain the  evolution  of man into two  species . It is perhaps the best testimony to the  influence  of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In  Rudyard Kipling 's novel  Kim , the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires of Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: \"They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena.  Spencer says.\" \"I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know.\" \"He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal.\"\nEly was a product of the German historical school with an emphasis on  evolution  to new forms, and never accepted the  marginalist revolution  that was transforming economic theory in Britain and the U.S. He was strongly influenced by  Herbert Spencer  and strongly favored competition over  monopoly  or  state ownership , with regulation to \"secure its benefits\" and \"mitigate its evils.\" What was needed was \"to raise its moral and ethical level.\" However, whereas Herbert Spencer believed that free competition was best served by deregulation and a smaller state, Richard Ely believed that more regulation and a more interventionist state was the policy to follow. Also on  social Darwinism , Herbert Spencer believed that the state should not get involved in supporting one ethnic group over another \u2014 whereas Richard Ely believed that the state should support white \"Nordic\" people against people of other races (in line with the opinions of his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin,  Edward Alsworth Ross  and  Charles R. Van Hise ).\nHerbert Spencer  (United Kingdom, 1820\u20131903), philosopher, psychologist, and sociologist, advanced what he called the \" Law of equal liberty \" and argued against liberal theory promoting more activist government, which he dubbed \"a new form of  Tory ism.\" He supported a state limited in its duties to the defense of persons and their property. For Spencer, voluntary cooperation was the hallmark of the most vibrant form of society, accommodating the widest diversity of members and the greatest diversity of goals. Spencer's  evolution ary approach has been characterized as an extension of  Adam Smith 's \"invisible hand\" explanation of economic order; his extensive work on sympathy (in  psychology  as well as the foundation of ethics, particularly in  The Data of Ethics ) explicitly carried on Smith's approach in  The Theory of Moral Sentiments . Spencer is frequently characterized as a leading  Social Darwinist .\nAs a result, White frequently championed  nineteenth century evolutionists  in a search for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are firmly rooted in the writings of  Herbert Spencer ,  Charles Darwin , and  Lewis H. Morgan . While it can be argued that White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.\nIn 1883  Lester Frank Ward  (1841\u20131913) published Dynamic Sociology: Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and laid out the basic tenets of modern American liberalism while at the same time attacking the laissez-faire policies advocated by  Herbert Spencer  and  William Graham Sumner . Ward was a passionate advocate for a sociology which would intelligently and scientifically direct the development of society.\nThe first college course entitled \"Sociology\" was taught in the United States at  Yale  in 1875 by  William Graham Sumner . In 1883  Lester F. Ward , the first president of the American Sociological Association, published Dynamic Sociology\u2014Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez-faire sociology of  Herbert Spencer  and Sumner. Ward's 1200 page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the  University of Kansas , lectured by  Frank W. Blackmar . The Department of Sociology at the  University of Chicago  was established in 1892 by  Albion Small , who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894.  George Herbert Mead  and  Charles Cooley , who had met at the  University of Michigan  in 1891 (along with  John Dewey ), would move to Chicago in 1894. Their influence gave rise to  social psychology  and the  symbolic interactionism  of the modern  Chicago School . The  American Journal of Sociology  was founded in 1895, followed by the  American Sociological Association  (ASA) in 1905. The sociological \"canon of classics\" with Durkheim and  Max Weber  at the top owes in part to  Talcott Parsons , who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences. Parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. Sociology in the United States was less historically influenced by  Marxism  than its European counterpart, and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach.\nIn essence Spencer's philosophical vision was formed by a combination of  deism  and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth century deism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society and from books like  George Combe 's immensely popular The Constitution of Man (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a 'Being transcendentally kind.' Natural laws were thus the statutes of a well governed universe that had been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although Spencer lost his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception of the Deity, he nonetheless held fast to this conception at an almost sub-conscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more than he would ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it was only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it was idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy.\nThe  Positivist  philosophy that took form in Poland after the  January 1863 Uprising  was hardly identical with the philosophy of  Auguste Comte .  It was in fact a return to the line of  Jan \u015aniadecki  and  Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj \u2014a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period\u2014now enriched with the ideas of Comte.  However, it belonged only partly to  philosophy .  It combined Comte's ideas with those of  John Stuart Mill  and  Herbert Spencer , for it was interested in what was common to them all:  a sober,  empirical  attitude to life.\nThough Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not least in his influence on  structural functionalism , his attempt to introduce Lamarckian or Darwinian ideas into the realm of sociology was unsuccessful. It was considered by many, furthermore, to be actively dangerous.  Hermeneutic ians of the period, such as  Wilhelm Dilthey , would pioneer the distinction between the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften) and human sciences ( Geisteswissenschaften ). In the United States, the sociologist  Lester Frank Ward , who would be elected as the first president of the  American Sociological Association , launched a relentless attack on Spencer's theories of laissez-faire and political ethics. Although Ward admired much of Spencer's work he believed that Spencer's prior political biases had distorted his thought and had led him astray. In the 1890s,  \u00c9mile Durkheim  established formal academic sociology with a firm emphasis on practical  social research .  By the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists, most notably  Max Weber , had presented methodological  antipositivism . However, it should be noted that Spencer's theories of laissez-faire, survival-of-the-fittest and minimal human interference in the processes of natural law had an enduring and even increasing appeal in the social science fields of economics and political science, and one writer has recently made the case for Spencer's importance for a sociology that must learn to take energy in society seriously.\nA broad historical paradigm in both sociology and  anthropology , functionalism addresses the  social structure  as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by  Herbert Spencer ) is to regard  norm s and  institution s as 'organs' that work toward the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as  Marcel Mauss ,  Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski  and  Alfred Radcliffe-Brown . It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of  social evolutionism . As  Giddens  states: \"Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects).\"\nThe early sociology of  Herbert Spencer  came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms.\nHarry Burrows Acton (1908\u20131974) was an English academic in the field of  political philosophy , known for books defending the  morality  of  capitalism , and attacking  Marxism-Leninism . He in particular produced arguments on the incoherence of  Marxism , which he described as a 'farrago' (in philosophical terms). His book The Illusion of the Epoch, in which this appears, is a standard point of reference. Other interests were the  Marquis de Condorcet ,  Hegel ,  John Stuart Mill ,  Herbert Spencer ,  F. H. Bradley ,  Bernard Bosanquet  and  Sidney Webb .\nIn 1876, Sumner became the first to teach a course entitled \" sociology \" in the English-speaking world, though this course focused on the thought of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer , rather than the formal academic sociology that would be established 20 years later by  \u00c9mile Durkheim  in Europe. He was the second  president of American Sociological Association  serving from 1908 to 1909. and succeeding his longtime ideological opponent  Lester F. Ward .\nThe contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic as a result of the contentions of classical social theory. In  Randall Collins ' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ( Simmel ) and  pragmatist  ( Mead ,  Cooley ) theories of social interaction.  Utilitarianism , also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with  economics , is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by  Raewyn Connell , a tradition that is often forgotten is that of  Social Darwinism , which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily  Herbert Spencer ,  Lester F. Ward  and  William Graham Sumner . Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.\nPolish \"Positivism\" drew its name from the philosophy of  Auguste Comte . Much of its ideology was inspired by the works of British scholars and scientists including  Herbert Spencer  and  John Stuart Mill . The Polish Positivists advocated the exercise of reason before emotion.  They believed that independence, if it is to be regained, must be won gradually, by \"building from the foundations\" (creating a material infrastructure and educating the public) and through  organic work  that would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated social organism (a concept borrowed from  Herbert Spencer ).\nInfluenced by the  utopian socialist   Henri Saint-Simon , Comte developed the positive philosophy in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the  French Revolution , calling for a new social doctrine based on the  sciences . Comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as  Karl Marx ,  John Stuart Mill , and  George Eliot . His concept of sociologie and   social evolutionism  set the tone for early  social theorist s and  anthropologist s such as  Harriet Martineau  and  Herbert Spencer , evolving into modern academic sociology presented by  \u00c9mile Durkheim  as practical and objective  social research .\nHerbert Spencer  (1820\u20131903) was a  British   philosopher  famous for applying the theory of  natural selection  to society. He was in many ways the first true sociological functionalist. In fact, while Durkheim is widely considered the most important functionalist among positivist theorists, it is well known that much of his analysis was culled from reading Spencer's work, especially his Principles of Sociology (1874\u201396). In describing society, Spencer alludes to the analogy of human body. Just as the structural parts of the human body - the skeleton, muscles, and various internal organs \u2013 function independently to help the entire organism survive, social structures work together to preserve society.\nThe contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic. In  Randall Collins ' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ( Simmel ) and  pragmatist  ( Mead ,  Cooley ) theories of social interaction.  Utilitarianism , also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with  economics , is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by  Raewyn Connell , a tradition that is often forgotten is that of  Social Darwinism , which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily  Herbert Spencer ,  Lester F. Ward  and  William Graham Sumner . Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.\nSpencer read with excitement the original  positivist  sociology of  Auguste Comte . A  philosopher of science , Comte had proposed a theory of  sociocultural evolution  that society progresses by a general  law of three stages . Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Given the primacy with which Spencer placed on evolution in his work, Spencer's sociology might be described as  socially Darwinistic  (though strictly speaking he was a proponent of  Lamarckism  rather than Darwinism).  Despite the popularity of this view, such a description of Spencer's sociology is mistaken.  While Spencer's political and ethical writings had themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are not present in Spencer's sociological works, which focus on building a theory regarding how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing amounts of complexity amongst the various forms of social organization\nFollowing Ward as president of the American Sociological Association was  William Graham Sumner  from 1908 to 1909. He also held the first professorship of sociology at  Yale College , and in 1876, Sumner became the first to teach a course entitled \"sociology\" in the English-speaking world. His course focused predominantly on the work of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . He was ideologically opposed to the sociology of Ward as he felt that society could not be steered by scientific intervention, and famously stated the alternative to \"survival of the fittest\" was the \"survival of the unfittest.\" However, he also opposed the grand theorizing of Spencer. During the  Progressive Era  in the United States, social Darwinism became a contentious topic and Sumner and his course at  Yale College  was criticized for including Spencerian ideas. This almost led to Sumner's expulsion from teaching. His most famous sociological works are What Social Classes Owe to Each Other in 1883 and Folkways: a study of the sociological importance of usages, manners, customs, mores, and morals in 1906.\nDilthey was also interested in what some would call  sociology  in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . He objected to their  dialectic al/ evolution ist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, as well as their narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of  positivism  was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good things to say about the  neo-Kantian  sociology of  Georg Simmel , with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of  Max Weber , the primary founder of sociological  antipositivism . J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of  nonpositivist verstehende sociology  and the  Verstehen  method.\nWilliam Strutt and Richard Forester were both to go on to be presidents of the society following Darwin's death in 1803. Strutt had been a founding member and Forester was the son of  Richard French , another founding member. The local schoolmaster and philosopher  William George Spencer  was secretary of the society from 1815 and his son the philosopher  Herbert Spencer  gained much inspiration from Derby literary and scientific culture. Significantly it was Spencer who coined the phrase \" survival of the fittest \", after he read Darwin's grandson's work on evolution. Another notable associate of the society was  Abraham Bennet  although he was never a member, unlike  James Pilkington , the radical minister and the author of a A View of Derbyshire.\nAccording to Comte, scientific method constrains itself to observations, but frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws\u2014positive statements\u2014irrefutable by theology or by metaphysics, and laid as  foundation for subsequent knowledge .  Later, concluding science insufficient for society, Comte launched  Religion of Humanity , whose churches, honoring eminent scientists, led worship of humankind.  Comte coined the term  altruism , and emphasized  science's application  for humankind's social welfare, which would be revealed by Comte's spearheaded science, sociology.  Comte's influence is prominent in  Herbert Spencer  of England and  \u00c9mile Durkheim  of France establishing modern empirical and functionalist sociology.  Influential in the latter 19th century, positivism was often linked to evolutionary theory, yet was eclipsed in the 20th century by  neopositivism : logical positivism and logical empiricism.\nIts publisher,  John Chapman , introduced Spencer to his salon which was attended by many of the leading radical and progressive thinkers of the capital, including  John Stuart Mill ,  Harriet Martineau ,  George Henry Lewes  and Mary Ann Evans ( George Eliot ), with whom he was briefly romantically linked. Spencer himself introduced the biologist  Thomas Henry Huxley , who would later win fame as 'Darwin's Bulldog' and who remained his lifelong friend. However it was the friendship of Evans and Lewes that acquainted him with John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic and with  Auguste Comte 's  positivism  and which set him on the road to his life's work. He strongly disagreed with Comte.\nOn the subject of charity Andrew Carnegie's actions diverged in the most significant and complex manner from Herbert Spencer's philosophies. In his 1854 essay \"Manners and Fashion\", Spencer referred to public education as \"Old schemes\". He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, \"political, religious, literary, philanthropic\", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand. In addition, Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become evermore corrupted by the influence of power and money. The institution eventually loses its \"original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism\". Spencer insisted that all forms of philanthropy that uplift the poor and downtrodden were reckless and incompetent. Spencer thought any attempt to prevent \"the really salutary sufferings\" of the less fortunate \"bequeath to posterity a continually increasing curse\". Carnegie, a self-proclaimed devotee of Spencer, testified to Congress on February 5, 1915: \"My business is to do as much good in the world as I can; I have retired from all other business.\"\nNineteenth century thinker  Herbert Spencer  coined the term super-organic to focus on social organization (the first chapter of his Principles of  Sociology  is entitled \"Super-organic Evolution\"), though this was apparently a distinction between the organic and the social, not an identity: Spencer explored the  holistic  nature of society as a  social organism  while distinguishing the ways in which society did not behave like an organism. For Spencer, the super-organic was an  emergent  property of interacting organisms, that is, human beings. And, as has been argued by D. C. Phillips, there is a \"difference between emergence and reductionism.\"\nThis tradition often aligns with classical functionalism and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.\nFor this reason, he preferred the term social physics to sociology. The Development of the Discipline . The first book with the word sociology in its title was assembled in the 19th century by the English philosopher Herbert Spencer. In the United States, the first Sociology course was taught at the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1890 under the title Elements of Sociology (the oldest continuing sociology course in America).\nEvolution myths: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Survival of the fittest\u00e2\u0080\u0099 justifies \u00e2\u0080\u0098everyone for themselves\u00e2\u0080\u0099.
