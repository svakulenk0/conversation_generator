{"input_text": "Netflix , an online  movie streaming  website founded in 1997, is an example of how an online business has affected a B&M businesses such as  video rental store s. After Netflix and similar companies became popular, traditional DVD rental stores such as  Blockbuster LLC  went out of business. Customers preferred to be able to instantly watch movies and TV shows using \"streaming\", without having to go to a physical rental store to rent a DVD, and then return to the store to give the DVD back. \"The rapid rise of  online film streaming  offered by the likes of  Lovefilm  and Netflix made Blockbuster's video and DVD [rental] business model practically obsolete.' There has been an increase in online retailers in the 2000s, as people are using  e-commerce  (online sales) to fulfill basic needs ranging from grocery shopping to book purchases. Sales through mobile devices such as  tablet computer s and  smartphone s have also risen in the 2000s: \"While total online sales rose 18% year-on-year in December to \u00a311.1 [B], according to the latest figures [January 2014] from e-tail industry body IMRG and advisory firm Capgemini, sales via mobile devices doubled to \u00a33 [B].'\nThe company had utilized company-owned distribution facilities, in addition to claiming a nationwide network of independent video retailers (IVRs) to service both pay-per-rental and subscription customers. While in business, its main competitors were  Netflix.com  and  Blockbuster.com . Intelliflix gained notoriety by being the only major DVD-rental company that offered  adult movies  and game rentals in the same subscription.\nWhen the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of  Hulu  and to  Apple 's new video-rental services. Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.\nAs of April 2010, the movie is available on DVD at  Blockbuster Video ,  Redbox  and  Netflix .\nNetflix  ended 2008 with 9.39 million customers.   Blockbuster Video  claimed 1 million online customers in August 2005, 2 million by March 2006, and finished the first quarter of 2007 with 3 million. There are no recent published numbers for Blockbuster Online since 2007.  Walmart  briefly entered the market as well, but withdrew in 2005 and now has a cross-promotional agreement with  Netflix .\nOther competitors include Rafter, Warehouse Deals, and Apex Media.\nIn 1998, about a year after Netflix's founding, the company grew by starting in the  DVD by mail  business. In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and  Blu-ray  rental service. The company expanded internationally with streaming made available to Canada in 2010 and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix was available in over 190 countries. Netflix entered the production business in 2013, debuting its first series,  House of Cards . It greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering \" Netflix Original \" content through its online library of films and television. Netflix is releasing an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.\nCompetitors include  Apple   iTunes ,  Amazon Video ,  CinemaNow ,  Hulu ,  LOVEFiLM ,  Google Play ,  Netflix ,  FandangoNow , UltraFlix, and  Voddler .\nHollywood Video was the target of a  hostile takeover  attempt, initially announced at the end of December 2004 by competitor  Blockbuster Video . In February 2005, Blockbuster announced an exchange offer of $14.50 per share ($11.50 cash and $3.00 in Blockbuster shares).\nHollywood Entertainment Corporation ( Nasdaq : HLYW), known as Hollywood Video, was a  home video  and  video game   rental shop  company started in 1988. The chain was the largest direct competitor to  Blockbuster Video  until it was purchased by  Movie Gallery  in 2005.\nAs well as discovery, the Jinni website included  Internet television , the  online streaming  of film and TV, mostly only available in the US, e.g. via  Hulu . Jinni also linked to other sites that rent or sell  DVDs  or offer downloading or streaming for a fee, such as  Netflix ,  Amazon  and  Blockbuster .\nHollywood Video was the target of a  hostile takeover  attempt, initially announced at the end of December 2004 by competitor  Blockbuster Video . In February 2005, Blockbuster announced an exchange offer of $14.50 per share ($11.50 cash and $3.00 in Blockbuster shares). In response, Hollywood Video agreed to a buyout on Monday, January 10, 2005 by Movie Gallery, a smaller competitor. Movie Gallery paid $860 million, $13.25 per share, and the assumption of $380 million in debt. Stocks closed at $13.85 on January 10 after this news. Blockbuster then dropped its purchase plans, citing anti-trust concerns. Movie Gallery completed its purchase of Hollywood Video on April 27, 2005.\nIn Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services  Presto ,  Stan  and  Quickflix . In  Scandinavia , Netflix competes with  Viaplay ,  HBO Nordic  and  CMore Play .  In  Southeast Asia , Netflix competes with  HOOQ , Astro On the Go,  Sky on Demand ,  Singtel TV , HomeCable OnDemand, and  iflix .

In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision. In  South Africa , Netflix competes with  ShowMax . In the  Middle East , Netflix competes with  Starz Play Arabia .\nA famous hypothetical example of Initial Interest Confusion, first discussed in  Brookfield v West Coast Entertainment , involves two video stores. West Coast Video\u2019s competitor, Blockbuster Video, puts a billboard on a stretch of highway advertising a West Coast Video at an upcoming exit. In reality, there is no West Coast Video at this exit; it is a Blockbuster Video instead. The consumer, expecting to find a West Coast Video store, sees the Blockbuster Video and decides to patronize the suitable replacement. Even though the confusion has been dispelled, Blockbuster is still misappropriating the acquired goodwill of West Coast Video\u2019s trademark.\nThe company surpassed  Blockbuster  in 2007 in number of U.S. locations, passed 100 million rentals in February 2008, and passed 1 billion rentals in September 2010.  Competitors include  Netflix  and  Blockbuster . In Q2 2011, kiosks accounted for 36 percent of the disc rental market, with 38 percent of that attributable to rent-by-mail services and 25 percent to traditional stores, according to the  NPD Group . As of Q2 2011, 68 percent of the U.S. population lived within a five-minute drive of a Redbox kiosk. The numbers for Q2 2013 shows that the Redbox rentals had surpassed 50 percent of the total disc rentals in the country.\nIn 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor, which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011. In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).\nThe launch in Latin America was not as successful as the company had hoped. While in Latin America, Netflix had no streaming competitors as it did in Canada, the digital divide (a lack of high broadband internet penetration) hindered rapid growth. In Brazil, for example, only 20% of the population had an internet speed greater than ;  a second are needed to stream Netflix's content. Furthermore, the lack of competitors in some ways slowed growth as well. Whereas in Canada new subscribers had been exposed to streaming content by other companies, the concept was newer to a wide Latin American audience, making some skeptical of the prospect. A banking system unused to recurrent monthly transactions exacerbated the problem. Still, while Latin American expansion happened more slowly than expected, Netflix was not out anything for the expansion and their Canadian expansion happened at a faster rate than expected, making their first two forays into the international market fairly successful. Additionally, despite the hindrances to growth in Latin America, Netflix continued in pursuit of content expansion, signing a deal with Fox in May 2012 (for a July 15 start) to make its popular content (e.g.,  How I Met Your Mother , Glee, Bones, The X-Files, Wall Street) available in the region.\nOnline movie start-up, Zediva.com, aimed to differentiate itself from competitors such as Netflix by streaming popular movies the day they came out on DVD for an extremely low price. The Hoffman Agency\u2019s launch of the company included counseling a redesign of its website and allowing journalists to \u201cpreview\u201d the service ahead of the launch. The media coverage that resulted from the launch caused a flood of consumer traffic to Zediva\u2019s website, causing the site to be overwhelmed and taken offline for maintenance.\nBlockbuster LLC (formerly Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc.), known as Blockbuster, was an American-based provider of home movie and video game rental services through  video rental shop s,  DVD-by-mail ,  streaming ,  video on demand , and cinema theater. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster consisted of nearly 60,000 employees and over 8,000 stores. As a result of various factors including competition from  Netflix ,  Redbox , and  video on demand  services, Blockbuster lost significant revenue and filed for bankruptcy protection on September 23, 2010.  On April 6, 2011, the company and its remaining 1,700 stores were bought by satellite television provider  Dish Network .  While the Blockbuster brand has mostly been retired, Dish still maintains some Blockbuster franchise agreements, with approximately 12 stores remaining.\nMoreflicks - Website showing what's available on all regions on Netflix Instant and other popular streaming sites.

Blockbuster CEO Jim Keyes just did an interview with Rick Munarriz over at the Motley Fool, and boy did he come out looking like a fool with some of his comments.\nNetFlixNetFlix invented the online dvd rental service back in 1999 and is still the leader. But Intelliflix is blazing new trails by offering over 60,000 Movies and Video Game rentals with annual plans starting at half the price of any other dvd rental service. BlockBuster is now agressively trying to take customers away from NetFlix with lower pricing and by leveraging their 4500 retail stores.\nWe chose Netflix for its convenience and variety of features. The main competitors fall in 3 categories: brick and mortar video rental stores (BlockBuster and Hollywood Video), online video rentals (BlockBuster Total Access), and one day DVD rentals from a kiosk (like RedBox and BlockBuster).nline video streaming and other Netflix features.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe that when Roku launched its first on-demand video streaming box, the Netflix Player by Roku, the device didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support HD video and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have access to Netflix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full library, despite its brand name. Fast forward seven years to the Roku 4. The newest Roku and its competitors are no longer just workarounds so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to attach your PC to your TV.

As Forbes points out, Amazon's streaming has just looked like a nice bonus for people who use Amazon Prime for free shipping, but it may now appear to be a genuine streaming alternative to Netflix.\nMoreflicks - Website showing what's available on all regions on Netflix Instant and other popular streaming sites.
