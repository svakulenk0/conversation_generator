{"input_text": "Many New Pop artists created technologically oriented music that sweetened less commercial and experimental aspects with a  pop  coating.   Entryism  became a popular concept for groups at the time. New Music acts were danceable, had an  androgynous  look, emphasized the  synthesizer  and  drum machine s, wrote about the darker side of romance, and were  British . They rediscovered  rockabilly ,  Motown ,  ska ,  reggae  and merged it with African rhythms to produce what was described as a \"fertile, stylistic cross-pollination\". Author  Simon Reynolds  noted that the New Pop movement \"involved a conscious and brave attempt to bridge the separation between  'progressive' pop  and mass/chart pop \u2013 a divide which has existed since 1967, and is also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.\"\nFrom about 1967, the term was increasingly used in opposition to the term  rock music , a division that gave generic significance to both terms. Whereas rock aspired to  authenticity  and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music, pop was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible. According to British musicologist  Simon Frith , pop music is produced \"as a matter of  enterprise  not art\", is \"designed to appeal to everyone\" and \"doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste\". It is \"not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward ... and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative\". It is, \"provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers and concert promoters) rather than being made from below ... Pop is not a  do-it-yourself  music but is professionally produced and packaged\".\nLatin pop ( Spanish  and  Portuguese :Pop latino)  refers to  pop music  that contains sounds or influence from Latin America, but it can also mean pop music from anywhere in the  Spanish-speaking  and Portuguese-speaking world. Latin pop usually combines upbeat Latin music with American pop music. Latin pop is commonly associated with Spanish-language pop, rock, and dance music.\nThe middle of the 20th century saw a number of very important changes in American popular music.  The field of  pop music  developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry.  As a result, music  marketing  became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of.  Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like  Dean Martin ,  Rudy Vallee ,  Tony Bennett ,  Perry Como ,  Frankie Laine  and, most famously, the \"first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans\"  Frank Sinatra . The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s.  Bubblegum pop  groups like  The Monkees  were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability.  The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk. By the end of the 1960s, two developments had completely changed popular music: the birth of a  counterculture , which explicitly opposed mainstream music, often in tandem with political and social activism, and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both  singers and songwriters .\nThe term was not generally used outside the confines of small music magazines until the mid 2000s, partly due to the exponential increase in  blogger s who used it more seriously in analytical debate. In the 2000s, poptimism (or popism) represented a critical reassessment of  pop music , and in the 2010s, it supplanted rockism as the prevailing ideology in popular musical criticism. Opponents of poptimist discourse have criticized the movement, believing that it has resulted in certain pop stars being prevented from negative reviews as part of an effort to maintain a consensus of uncritical excitement.\nSound of the Underground received generally positive reviews from contemporary pop music critics.  The Times  noted that Sound of the Underground \"is packed with everything you want from a pop record \u2013 attitude, aggression, guitars, disco beats and steals from Phil Spector.\"  Yahoo! Music  said that Girls Aloud \"have made a seriously fine debut album. OK, so it's not  Blonde on Blonde ,  Innervisions  or  OK Computer , but it may well be another  Spice .\" A number of reviews noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. It was said that \"Girls Aloud are on the better end of the commercial pop scale.\" Ian Youngs of  BBC News  bluntly stated, \"Reality pop is not supposed to be this good.\"  BBC Music  said \"time will tell if they are set to take the mantle as the new  Spice Girls  or slip rapidly down pops dumper as the new  Hear'Say . But their debut album is sure to shut up at least some of their cynics, myself included.\"\nWestern pop musicians first began to explore the music of other cultures in the mid-sixties, when they began to mix Western electric pop with influences taken from the traditional music of India. Although the resulting artefacts of \" raga rock \" were sometimes risible, it  proved to be the most influential fusion of pop and \"folk\" music of the entire period, specifically because it was the first widely accepted attempt to mix Western popular music with a completely non-Western musical tradition.\nSouth started his pop career in July 1958 with the NRC Records novelty hit \"The Purple People Eater Meets the Witch Doctor\".  After this hit, South's music grew increasingly serious.\nPowter explains that he wanted it to reflect on people, their relationships and himself, not about champagne or car rims: It's about people, relationships and situations in \"...piano pop music, over-infatuated on steroids.\"\n Music writers only started \"treating pop and rock music seriously\" in 1964 \"after the breakthrough of the Beatles...\". One of the early music magazines in Britain,  Melody Maker , complained in 1967 about how \"newspapers and magazines are continually hammering [i.e., attacking]  pop music \". Melody Maker magazine advocated the new forms of pop music of the late 1960s. \"By 1999, the 'quality' press was regularly carrying reviews of popular music gigs and albums\", which had a \"key role in keeping pop\" in the public eye. As more pop music critics began writing, this had the effect of \"legitimating pop as an art form\"; as a result, \"newspaper coverage shifted towards pop as music rather than pop as social phenomenon\".\n\"Pop Diva\" received favourable reviews from most music critics. Stern was positive towards the single, commending the composition and production. In conclusion, he stated \"'Pop Diva' is noisy, overly Auto-Tuned and seriously disjointed, but also kind of brilliant in places. That\u2019s just the way good pop works, you know?\". Paige Lim from  Strait Times  reviewed Koda's Walk of My Live 2015 concert tour, and was positive towards the original versions of \"Pop Diva\", and \"House Party\" and \"Poppin' Love Cocktails\" from  Walk of My Life  (2015) and  Japonesque  (2012), respectively; she labelled them \"fast-paced, catchy tunes...\" A reviewer from  CD Journal  was positive, commending the production of the song and labelled the composition \"impressive\". Tetsuo Hiraga from  Hot Express  was positive in his review. He commented that \"Pop Diva\" was a \"complete dance tune\" for everyone, and commended Koda's \"provocative\" and \"attitude\" delivery. However, a reviewer from Arcadey.net criticized the song's composition as \"crunk hip-hop trash\". In March\u2013April 2012, an online poll was hosted on  Popjustice  by fans ranking their favourite single by Koda. With over 70 singles from her back-catalogue listed, \"Pop Diva\" ranked at 21 with three people rating it ten points, and another three people rating it the lowest score at six.\nUntil the 1990s,  trot  and  ballad s dominated South Korean popular music. The emergence of the rap group  Seo Taiji and Boys  in 1992 marked a turning point for South Korean popular music, also known as  K-pop , as the group incorporated elements of popular musical genres from the West such as  hip hop ,  rhythm and blues ,  electronic dance ,  jazz ,  reggae ,  funk , and  rock  into its music. Hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, electronic dance and ballad oriented acts have become dominant in the South Korean popular music scene, though trot is still enjoyed among older South Koreans. K-pop stars and groups are well known across Asia and have found international fame making millions of dollars in export revenue. Many K-pop acts have been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as  YouTube . South Korean music artist  PSY  became an international sensation when his song \" Gangnam Style \" topped global music charts in 2012.\nIhmisten edess\u00e4 was well received by music critics, as most of the reviewers complimented the audacious use of musical elements and styles and Vartiainen's nuanced vocals and interpretation. The critics also noted Vartiainen's stylistic departure from her previous pop band  Gimmel . Writing for  Helsingin Sanomat , Ilkka Mattila gave Ihmisten edess\u00e4 four out of five stars, saying the debut album was a \"precedent\" in the Finnish pop of the 2000s as it showed how Vartiainen \"seriously tries to get rid of a  talent show star's  role\". Mattila considered \"Tunnoton\" with its \"captivating banjo and  folk  ambience\" one of the best Finnish pop songs of the year and \"Ihmisten edess\u00e4\" \" British -spirited, melancholic gay disco with all the hooks\". Helsingin Sanomat praised Vartiainen's intimate interpretation as the core of the music. Noting a little  R&B -esque singing popular on talent shows, Mattila went on to say the record is \"commercial though amibitious and, therefore, pleasurable pop\". Mattila credited producer and composer Jukka Immonen for \"fearlessly using unfashionable special effects such as  Soul II Soul -like comping and synthetic choirs\". Kirsi Taivainen from  Keskisuomalainen  gave the album four out of five stars alike, saying the album is \"balanced, hued, poppish music\" that is \"not too calculated for being genuine\". Noting old synthpop sounds and tiny musical elements, she considered the \"finely-mixed album strongly contemporary\". Giving credits to the bass and drums synchronizing the songs with a back rhythm, Taivainen complimented Vartiainen's \"developed vocals with a range of delicate nuances\" for \"not being mainstream\".\nPop music emerged in Afghanistan during the 1950s, and became very popular until the late 1970s. What helped the emergence of pop music in Afghanistan were amateur singers from non-traditional music backgrounds who wanted to showcase their talents in the studio (Radio Kabul). These singers were from middle- to upper-class families and were more educated than singers from traditional music backgrounds.\nJazz  began to take itself seriously as  swing  gave way to  bebop  in the 1940s, but could not maintain its listening audience. Following the economic boom of the mid 1960s, record labels began investing in artists whose ambitions paralleled these earlier attempts in jazz, offering performers limited control over their own content and marketing. This resulted in a brief period in which creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other, a situation that fell into abeyance between the late 1970s and the birth of Internet stars. Beginning in 1967, pop music would be divided by a \" progressive pop \" and \"mass/chart pop\" demographic that subsequently gave rise to the \" progressive rock \" movement, which crystallized the progressive music of earlier artists into a recognizable genre.\nIn the 1980s, rap artists including  Run DMC ,  Beastie Boys  and  LL Cool J  set up the blueprints and origins of pop-rap as they suddenly broke into the mainstream. LL Cool J has been described as the very first \"pop-rapper\" in history, when he rose to prominence on his 1985 debut album  Radio . When he joined  Russell Simmons '  Def Jam  label and decided to try merging rap with pop and R&B influences, some people were skeptical that it would ever work.  MTV  has described LL Cool J's 1987 single \" I Need Love ,\" as \"one of the first pop-rap  crossover   hits \". Later, rap artists such as  Tone Loc ,  Young MC , and  Fresh Prince  then made songs with lots of party tunes and storytelling abilities as they became very popular. During the 1990s, pop rap began to expand even more as hip hop music also began to connect strongly with  dance music  and  R&B .\nPop music really started in  south asia n region with the famous playback singer  Ahmed Rushdi 's song \u2018Ko Ko Korina\u2019 in 1966. Composed by  Sohail Rana , the song was a blend of 1960s  bubblegum pop ,  rock and roll   twist music  and Pakistani film music. This genre would later be termed as filmi pop. Paired with  Runa Laila , the singer is considered the pioneering father of  pop music , mostly  hip-hop  and  disco , in  Pakistan .\nJapanese pop singer  Namie Amuro  is now recognized as \"Queen of Hip-Pop\" after releasing a successful album in 2005 using the title \" Queen of Hip-Pop \". Amuro experimented huge popularity in Japan when she broke into the music business in 1992 but her popularity and album and single sales started to decline in 2000. When Amuro released the singles \" Girl Talk/The Speed Star \" and \" Want Me, Want Me \", in 2004, which contains elements of hip hop mixed with pop music, her popularity started to grow up and she started gaining media attention again.\nj786 has a unique style and blend of electronic, pop and dance music. j786 has commented on this by saying, \"We're taking pop music back to its roots where it was refreshing and fun before it got diluted and became pop music of an unknown definition.  I can say with confidence that we are ahead of the curve and starting a trend with the style of music we're bringing that consists of strong melodies and meaningful yet simple lyrics with a message.\"\nThroughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from most other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on the  sentimental ballad  for its form, gained its use of vocal harmonies from  gospel  and  soul music , instrumentation from  jazz ,  country , and  rock music , orchestration from  classical music , tempo from  dance music , backing from  electronic music , rhythmic elements from  hip-hop music , and has recently appropriated spoken passages from  rap . According to  Robert Christgau  in 2014, pop music worldwide is permeated by  electronic dance music .\nDavid Hatch  and Stephen Millward define pop music as \"a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk musics\".According to  Pete Seeger , pop music is \"professional music which draws upon both folk music and fine arts music\".Although pop music is seen as just the  singles charts , it is not the sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including  classical ,  jazz ,  rock , and  novelty song s. Pop music, as a genre, is seen as existing and developing separately. Thus \"pop music\" may be used to describe a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to  rock and roll . Musicologist Allan Moore surmises that the term \"pop music\" itself may have originated from  Pop art . Additionally, it's important to note that pop music is always evolving, which means that the definition of pop music can change, too. It's also important to be cognizant of the distinction between pop music and popular music. According to The New Grove Dictionary Of Music and Musicians, popular music is defined as \"the music since industrialization in the 1800's that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class.\"\nPop music is a  genre  of  popular music  that originated in its modern form in the  Western world  during the 1950s and 1960s as a softer alternative to  rock and roll . The terms \"popular music\" and \"pop music\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \"Pop\" and \" rock \" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.\nThe origin of modern J-pop is said to be Japanese-language  rock music  inspired by the likes of  The Beatles . Unlike the Japanese music genre called  kay\u014dkyoku , J-pop uses a special kind of pronunciation, which is similar to that of  English . One notable singer to do so is  Keisuke Kuwata , who pronounced the Japanese word karada (\"body\") as kyerada.  Additionally, unlike Western music, the  major second  (sol and la) was usually not used in Japanese music, except  art music , before rock music became popular in Japan. When the  Group Sounds  genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular,  Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song \" I Want to Hold Your Hand \" and  The Rolling Stones ' song \" (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction \". Although Japanese pop music changed from music based on Japanese  pentatonic scale  and distortional  tetrachord  to the more occidental music over time, music that drew from the traditional Japanese singing style remained popular (such as that of  Ringo Shiina ).\nBritish pop music is popular music, produced commercially in the  United Kingdom . It emerged in the mid-to late 1950s as a softer alternative to  rock 'n' roll  and later to rock music. Like American pop music it has a focus on commercial recording, often orientated towards a youth market, as well as that of the  Singles Chart  usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs. While these basic elements of the genre have remained fairly constant, pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of  popular music , particularly borrowing from the development of rock music, and utilising key technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. From the British Invasion of the 1960s, led by  The Beatles , British pop music has alternated between acts and genres with national appeal and those with international success that have had a considerable impact on the development of the wider genre and on popular music in general.\nLost Souls was met with generally positive reviews. In a 2009 review,  BBC  praised the album, and described the album as a rock record that kept the dance spirit alive, but could also appeal to a  pop  audience: \"Lost Souls was a record that was widely discussed, and people wondered aloud whether its success marked the end of another era of dance music. In truth, it was a record about growing up; about giving up the drugs and the madness of  The Ha\u00e7ienda , where the three Cheshire lads met. But because the simmering emotion on songs like \"The Cedar Room\" was expressed through guitars rather than synths, in no way did that mean that Doves were taking dance music out the back and burying it in a shallow grave. But there was emotion, too \u2013 \"The Cedar Room\" is a beautiful seven-minute break-up song that complains: \"I tried to sleep alone, but I couldn't do it.\" This was a pop album that eventually appealed widely, and not just to the grown-up clubbers that could have been its sole audience.\"  Q  called the album \"heavy, sombre and lugubrious... it makes for seriously claustrophobic listening, until it takes a great gulp of euphoria.\"  NME  awarded the album 9 out of 10 stars, and called the album \"a serious and intense record... the first great album to come from Manchester since  Definitely Maybe ... they make being sad after drugs sound great.\" In a mixed review,  Pitchfork Media  reviewer Sam Eccleston took a \"straightforward\" and \"cynical\" approach with the album and rated it 6.8 out of 10, saying, \"Tonally, Lost Souls reflects the after-after-midnight hours, as if the boys felt the need to document the hung-over and blissed-out aftermath of the dancing-hours frenzy their Sub Sub days offered listeners years ago.\" The review goes on to say that, \"The heart of the problem on Lost Souls is its overreaching ambition ...[but]... despite its reach and ambition, works best in its most conventionally melodic moments.\"\nPopular music  in the 1990s  saw the continuation of  teen pop  and  dance-pop  trends which had emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore,  hip hop  grew and continued to be highly successful in the decade, with the continuation of the genre's  golden age . Aside from  rap ,  reggae ,  contemporary R&B  and  urban  music in general remained extremely popular throughout the decade; urban music in the late-1980s and 1990s often blended with styles such as  soul ,  funk  and  jazz , resulting in  fusion genre s such as  new jack swing ,  neo-soul ,  hip hop soul  and  g-funk  which were popular.\nAccording to the website of  The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , called Grove Music Online, the term \"pop music\" \"originated in  Britain  in the mid-1950s as a description for  rock and roll  and the new youth music styles that it influenced\". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's \"earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience ... since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as  the Beatles ,  the Rolling Stones ,  ABBA , etc\". Grove Music Online also states that \"... in the early 1960s [the term] 'pop music' competed terminologically with  beat music  [in England], while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of 'rock and roll'\".\nTiny Pop is a sister channel to  Pop , which was launched on 29 May 2003. Tiny Pop is a replacement for the retired station  Pop Plus , which was originally a secondary channel of Pop. Tiny Pop is aimed at a very young audience (similar to  CBeebies ). Tiny Pop has two further sister channels:  Pop Girl  was launched on 6 August 2007, and  Kix  was launched on 19 May 2008, when it replaced Pop +1, the 1-hour timeshift of Pop.\nBy the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000s pop music consisted mostly of a combination of pop-hip hop and R&B-tinged pop, including a number of  boy band s. Notable female singers also cemented their status in American and worldwide popular music, such as  Beyonc\u00e9  (with her solo career and as lead singer of  Destiny's Child ),  Britney Spears ,  Christina Aguilera ,  Katy Perry ,  Lady Gaga  and  Taylor Swift . Also notable was the influence of hip-hop producers on popular music in the mid-late 2000s, including the  Neptunes  and  Timbaland , who made the sounds first heard on  Justin Timberlake 's  FutureSex/LoveSounds  and  Nelly Furtado 's  Loose  imitated throughout popular radio with artists  Madonna ,  Akon  and  Lady Gaga . In the late 2000s into the early 2010s, pop music began to move towards being heavily influenced by the European electronic dance music scene, taking root in the college crowd through producers like  David Guetta ,  Calvin Harris ,  Swedish House Mafia  and  Skrillex .\nPersian pop music grew and developed during the 1950s. Different types of pop music, including rumba, tango and waltz music, were also developed during this period.\nWhereas rock musicians in Japan usually hate the term \"pop\", Taro Kato, a member of  pop punk  band  Beat Crusaders , pointed out that the encoded  pop music , like  pop art , was catchier than \"J-pop\" and he also said that J-pop was the  music, memorable for its frequency of airplay, in an interview when the band completed their first full-length studio album under a major label,  P.O.A.: Pop on Arrival , in 2005. Because the band did not want to perform J-pop music, their album featured the  1980s Pop  of  MTV . According to his fellow band member Toru Hidaka, the 1990s music that influenced him (such as  Nirvana ,  Hi-Standard , and  Flipper's Guitar ) was not listened to by fans of other music in Japan at that time.\nIn  North America ,  Europe  and  Oceania , the decade was particularly revolutionary in terms of  popular music , as it saw the formation and evolution of  rock . At the beginning of the 1960s,  pop  and  rock and roll  trends of the 1950s continued; nevertheless, the rock and roll of the decade before started to merge into a more international, eclectic variant known as rock. In the early-1960s, rock and roll in its purest form was gradually overtaken by  pop rock ,  beat ,  psychedelic rock ,  blues rock , and  folk rock , which had grown in popularity. The  country - and  folk -influenced style associated with the latter-half of 1960s rock music spawned a generation of popular  singer-songwriter s who wrote and performed their own work. Towards the decade's end, genres such as  Baroque pop ,  sunshine pop ,  bubblegum pop , and  progressive rock  started to grow popular, with the latter two finding greater success in the following decade. Furthermore, the 1960s saw  funk  and  soul  music rising in popularity;  rhythm and blues  in general remained popular, and this style was commonly associated to  Girl group s of the time, whose fusion of R&B and  Gospel  with rock and roll enjoyed success until the mid-part of the decade. Aside from the popularity of rock and R&B music in the 1960s,  Latin American  as well as  Jamaican  and  Cuban  music achieved a degree of popularity throughout the decade, with genres such as  Bossa nova , the  cha-cha-cha ,  ska , and  calypso  being popular. From a  classical  point of view, the 1960s were also an important decade as they saw the development of  experimental ,  jazz  and  contemporary classical  music, notably  minimalism  and  free improvisation .\nContemporary music in Europe is estimated to have begun in the mid-'50s. If we take into account the pop sensations that Madalena Iglesias and Simone de Oliveira were, contemporary Portuguese music should have started around the same time. And it should have happened in a rather jovial way as the young pop environment was breaking ground in society through the youngsters. Electronic music, which was rising in Germany, was then exported to Portugal, revealing itself as a success in the '80s.The pop fever got stronger in the '70s, also known as the \u201croaring years\u201d along with the '20s, with the growth of equally fulminating nightclubs largely situated on the coastline. It should be mentioned that the settling of this music genre had a very unneven growth between the coastline and the midland, the north and mid-north, and the south and mid-south. Whilst coastal and cosmopolitan Lisbon was following trends, even if discretely when compared to other European capitals, the midland was still completely clueless, remaining behind its time even today.The Hippie era strikes the country with its relaxed and urban style, and Portugal adapts itself deeply to this new trend. The Disco fever emerges and with it, the nightclubs. While in a corruptible dictatorship regime, responsible for years of cultural delay in comparison to the rest of Europe, the voice of artists like that of Ant\u00f3nio Varia\u00e7\u00f5es and Carlos Pai\u00e3o\u2019s, among others, started to become popular. Both had an enormous success. Songs like Playback and P\u00f3 de Arroz (Rice powder) from Pai\u00e3o, and O Corpo \u00e9 que paga (The Body pays it) from Varia\u00e7\u00f5es, are unforgettable. The death of Ant\u00f3nio Varia\u00e7\u00f5es, in 1984 was a great loss for contemporary music.However, ten years earlier, in 1974, when Portugal was still testing the waters of this new cool disco look, peaceful revolution took place on 25 April, which  defined the Portuguese way of being. The most interesting part is that the Carnation Revolution (Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos Cravos), as it would later be called, started with a song: Gr\u00e2ndola, Vila Morena, an intervention song which derived from intervention poetry. The intervention song got popular and its grieving content was a success, notwithstanding its hopeful and dreamy side, in the history of European contemporary music. Fado is put on the backburner, as it was considered to bring back memories from Salazar\u2019s dictatorship, and brought back up only in mid-\u201890s.In the \u201880s, electronic music became popular and was broadcast on radio and played in nightclubs in Lisbon. The rural midland finally starts to take its first steps on catching on to its contemporaries. Electronic music begins to conquer listeners from remote areas. Portugal also joins a rather eccentric and unusual age. It\u2019s the beginning of the age of rock music. Punk and dark rock derived from it shortly after, among others, and later on, metal and heavy metal did too. These are still conquering new listeners nowadays.By the \u201890s Xutos e Pontap\u00e9s had started performing, and Rui Veloso  became the best Portuguese Rock artist to date. Paulo Gonzo, Jorge Palma, Silence 4, GNR and others were also popular.\nLao pop music started forming itself in the late 1980s, when Laos started benefiting from an economic growth that has lasted till nowadays. Before the reforms implemented by the government, the entertainment industry was completely limited due to the tight censorship and the widespread poverty, which prevented the music scene from flourishing. From the 1970s to the late 1980s, the strictly patriotic songs, sponsored by the communist government, and the traditional  Mor Lam  genere were the only generes available to listen. At the start of the 1990s decade, the Lao music scene started transformating. The first private music labels started emerging in  Vientiane , the capital city, and some live music pubs appeared. However, these labels, at first, were financially weak and had a very limited capacity to promote their artists. Although at first the traditional Lao music, was still the most popular genere, the foreign influence of Korean  K-Pop  music, Japanese  J-Pop  music, and the pop music made in the neighbouring  Thailand  started being felt, not only in the fashion trends, but also in the local musical scene.From the start of the 2000s, L-pop saw a dramatic increase of popularity due to the growing strength of the mainly Vientiane based music labels such as Lao-Pride Records, KPY Entertainment, Indee Records and Muanson Media. Lao pop gained local and international spotlight through  Alexandra Bounxouei , who is considered to be the first Lao pop princess. Other Lao artists popular with the younger generation include Cells, L.O.G, Overdance, Princess, Caramel, Pull-T Club, Super One, Genii, Xtreme, Dozo, Tik Keoprasert, MAY, Annita, and Aluna.\nTowards the end of the 1960s, progressive pop music was received with doubt and disinterest. The Who's  Pete Townshend  reflected in 1974 that \"a lot of psychedelic bullshit was going on\", referring to \"garbage\" being promoted in the charts, and that many artists who were doing ambitious works were instantly being labelled \"pretentious\". He believed: \"Anybody that was any good ... was more or less becoming insignificant again.\" In 1969, writer  Nik Cohn  reported that the pop music industry had been split \"roughly eighty percent ugly and twenty percent idealist\", with the eighty percent being \"mainline pop\" and the twenty percent being \"progressive pop [developed to] an esoteric feel\". He predicted that in ten years, the genre would be called by another name (possibly \"electric music\"), and that its relationship to pop music would be similar to the one between  art movie s and  Hollywood . While progressive pop did not \"shrink to a minority cult\", as Cohn wrote one year later, \"in England, I wasn't entirely wrong ... But, in America, I fluffed completely \u2013 the  Woodstock  nation has kept growing and, for all his seriousness and pretensions to poetry, someone like  James Taylor  has achieved the same mass appeal as earlier stars.\"\nBefore dansband music became popular, many  jazz  orchestras played a \"schlager-inspired\" dance music. Many people believe that the development of the dansbands during the 1950s and 1960s depended on the decreasing interest for jazz, it being replaced by pop and rock as the most popular music among young people. Many Swedish dansbands of the time were known as pop groups during the 1960s, a gestation period shared with the  showband  scene in Ireland, which had many similarities with its Nordic counterpart, especially in the influences referenced in creating a homegrown music scene such as  jazz , American & British  pop music ,  swing , and  country .\nOrigins of Rap and Hip Hop Hip hop music (also referred to as rap or rap music) is a style of popular music which came into existence in roughly the mid '70s but became a large part of modern day pop culture in the late '80s.\nFor other uses, see Pop Song. Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950s.
