If we take into account the pop sensations that Madalena Iglesias and Simone de Oliveira were, contemporary Portuguese music should have started around the same time. And it should have happened in a rather jovial way as the young pop environment was breaking ground in society through the youngsters. Electronic music, which was rising in Germany, was then exported to Portugal, revealing itself as a success in the '80s.The pop fever got stronger in the '70s, also known as the \u201croaring years\u201d along with the '20s, with the growth of equally fulminating nightclubs largely situated on the coastline. It should be mentioned that the settling of this music genre had a very unneven growth between the coastline and the midland, the north and mid-north, and the south and mid-south. Whilst coastal and cosmopolitan Lisbon was following trends, even if discretely when compared to other European capitals, the midland was still completely clueless, remaining behind its time even today.The Hippie era strikes the country with its relaxed and urban style, and Portugal adapts itself deeply to this new trend. The Disco fever emerges and with it, the nightclubs. While in a corruptible dictatorship regime, responsible for years of cultural delay in comparison to the rest of Europe, the voice of artists like that of Ant\u00f3nio Varia\u00e7\u00f5es and Carlos Pai\u00e3o\u2019s, among others, started to become popular. Both had an enormous success. Songs like Playback and P\u00f3 de Arroz (Rice powder) from Pai\u00e3o, and O Corpo \u00e9 que paga (The Body pays it) from Varia\u00e7\u00f5es, are unforgettable. The death of Ant\u00f3nio Varia\u00e7\u00f5es, in 1984 was a great loss for contemporary music.However, ten years earlier, in 1974, when Portugal was still testing the waters of this new cool disco look, peaceful revolution took place on 25 April, which  defined the Portuguese way of being. The most interesting part is that the Carnation Revolution (Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos Cravos), as it would later be called, started with a song: Gr\u00e2ndola, Vila Morena, an intervention song which derived from intervention poetry. The intervention song got popular and its grieving content was a success, notwithstanding its hopeful and dreamy side, in the history of European contemporary music. Fado is put on the backburner, as it was considered to bring back memories from Salazar\u2019s dictatorship, and brought back up only in mid-\u201890s.In the \u201880s, electronic music became popular and was broadcast on radio and played in nightclubs in Lisbon. The rural midland finally starts to take its first steps on catching on to its contemporaries. Electronic music begins to conquer listeners from remote areas. Portugal also joins a rather eccentric and unusual age. It\u2019s the beginning of the age of rock music. Punk and dark rock derived from it shortly after, among others, and later on, metal and heavy metal did too. These are still conquering new listeners nowadays.By the \u201890s Xutos e Pontap\u00e9s had started performing, and Rui Veloso  became the best Portuguese Rock artist to date.
