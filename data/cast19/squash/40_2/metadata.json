{"input_text": "The Concerto for Flute and Orchestra was written by  Josef Reicha  in 1781, shortly after he went on a  Grand Tour  in the mid to late 1770s. Though the work was composed in 1781, far beyond the date music historians have deemed as the beginning of the  classical era,  it displays many characteristics of the  galant  musical style characteristic of the pre-classical post-Baroque music of the eighteenth century. Records do not indicate if Reicha began composing the work while he was visiting the cosmopolitan centers of Europe but we may assume that he was indeed inspired by what he heard and saw based on the prevalence of  galant  musical characteristics presented throughout the work including (1) a simplistic, song-like, and clear  melody , (2) short and periodic  phrases , (3) a reduced  harmonic vocabulary  that emphasizes  tonic  and  dominant , and (4) a clear distinction between soloist and accompaniment.\nVerbunkos was originally played at recruitment ceremonies to convince young men to join the army, and was performed, as in so much of Hungarian music, by Roma bands. One verbunkos tune, the \" R\u00e1k\u00f3czi March \" became a march that was a prominent part of compositions by both  Liszt  and  Hector Berlioz . The 18th-century origins of verbunkos are not well known, but probably include old dances like the  swine-herd dance  and the  Hajduk  dance, as well as elements of Balkan, Slavic and Levantine music, and the cultured music of Italy and Vienna, all filtered through the Roma performers. Verbunkos became wildly popular, not just among the poor peasantry, but also among the upper-class aristocratics, who saw verbunkos as the authentic music of the Hungarian nation. Characteristics of verbunkos include the  bok\u00e1z\u00f3  (clicking of heels)  cadence -pattern, the use of the interval of the augmented second, garlands of triplets, widely arched, free melodies without words, and alternately swift and slow tempi. By the end of the 18th century, verbunkos was in use in opera,  chamber  and  piano  music, and in song literature, and was regarded as \"the continuation, the resurrection of ancient Hungarian dance and music, and its success signified the triumph of the people's art\".\nAnahid Kassabian separated popular music into four categories; \"popular as  populist ,\" or having overtones of liberation and expression; \"popular as  folk ,\" or stating that the music is written by the people, for themselves; \"popular as  counterculture ,\" or empowering citizens to act against the  oppression  they face; and \"popular as mass,\" or the music becomes the tool for  oppression . A society's popular music reflects the ideals that are prevalent at the time it is performed or published. David Riesman states that the youth audiences of popular music fit into either a majority group or a  subculture . The majority group listens to the commercially produced styles while the subcultures find a minority style to transmit their own values. This allows youth to choose what music they identify with, which gives them power as consumers to control the market of popular music.\nAfrican blues is a genre of  popular music , primarily from  West Africa . The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional  African music  from its homeland to the  United States  and back. Some scholars and  ethnomusicologist s have speculated that the  origins of  the  blues  can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by  African-American s during and after  slavery . Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous.  One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation  work songs  with their  call-and-response  format, and more especially the relatively free-form  field hollers  of the later  sharecropper s, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.\nScholars have classified music as \"popular\" based on various factors, including whether a song or piece becomes known to listeners mainly from hearing the music (in contrast with  classical music , in which many musicians learn pieces from  sheet music ); its appeal to diverse listeners, its treatment as a marketplace  commodity  in a  capitalist  context, and other factors. Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience ( mass appeal ) or whether audience is of a certain  social class  is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, \"understandings of popular music have changed with time\". Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that genre and style are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the  musical technique s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".\nRock and roll  dominated popular music in the latter half of the 1950s. The musical style originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate  origins  lay in a mixing together of various  black musical  genres of the time, including  rhythm and blues  and  gospel music ;  with  country and western  and  Pop . In 1951,  Cleveland, Ohio  disc jockey  Alan Freed  began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase \"rock and roll\" to describe the music.\nEaster Island folk music has different origins from those of continental Chilean music. Instead, traditional music from the island consists of choral singing and chanting, similar to  Tahitian music  and the traditions of other Polynesian cultures. Families often performed as choirs, competing in an annual concert.  They accompanied their chanting with a  trumpet  made from a  conch  and a  percussive   dance r jumping onto a stone which is set over a  calabash   resonator .  Other instruments used include the  kauaha , created from the  jaw  bone of a horse; the  accordion ; and stones, which are clapped together for percussive effect. The most characteristic dances are:The \"Sau Sau\", a dance of Samoan origin that was introduced in the 1940s. The dance emphasizes female grace and sensuality and in the choreography, the couple performs flexible movements of the hips and hands.The \"Ula Ula\", a dance of Tahitian origin that is usually performed during local festivities. The couples dance separated undulating their hips laterally.The \"Tamur\u00e9\" also a Tahitian dance, is very fast and acrobatic and requires highly skilled dancers.The  Rainsick ,  Ukulele ,  Drum , and flute are instruments typically used in Rapa Nui music.\nBirmingham in the late 1960s and early 1970s was the birthplace of  heavy metal music , whose international success as a  musical genre  over subsequent decades has been rivalled only by  hip-hop  in the size of its global following, and which bears many hallmarks of its Birmingham origins. The city's location in the centre of England meant that its music scene was influenced both by the  London -based  British Blues Revival  and by the  melodic pop songwriting  of  Liverpool , allowing it to apply Liverpool's harmonically inventive approach to London's high-volume guitar-dominated style, in the process moving beyond the conventions of both. Birmingham's local  jazz  tradition was to influence heavy metal's characteristic use of  modal composition , and the dark sense of  irony  characteristic of the city's culture was to influence the genre's typical  b-movie   horror film  lyrical style and its defiantly  outsider  stance. The industrial basis of Birmingham society in the 1960s and 1970s was also significant: early heavy metal artists described the mechanical monotony of industrial life, the bleakness of the post-war urban environment and the pulsating sound of factory machinery as influences on the sound they developed, and  Black Sabbath 's use of loosely stringed  down-tuned guitars  and  power chords  partly resulted from lead guitarist  Tony Iommi 's loss of the ends of two fingers on his right hand in an industrial accident with a  sheet metal  cutting machine. The style of music also had precedents among earlier local bands: aggressive performing styles had been a characteristic of the wild and destructive stage shows of  The Move , and  Chicken Shack 's pioneering use of high volume  Marshall Stack s had pushed the boundaries of loud and aggressive  blues  to new extremes.\nThe original application of the term is to music of the 1880s  Tin Pan Alley  period in the United States. Although popular music sometimes is known as \"pop music\", the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population, whereas  pop music  usually refers to a specific musical genre within popular music. Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable  melodies . The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the  verse  and chorus or  refrain  repeating throughout the song and the  bridge  providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece.\nThe  Singer\u2013songwriter  movement of the Soviet Union is deeply rooted in amateur folklore songs played by students, tourists and travelling  geologists . It became highly popular in the 1960s and was sometimes considered as an alternative to official VIAs. Music characteristics of the genre consist of simple, easily repeatable parties, usually played by a single  acoustic guitar  player who simultaneously sang.  Among the singer-songwriters, termed as \"bards\", the most popular were  Bulat Okudzhava ,  Vladimir Vysotsky ,  Yuri Vizbor ,  Sergey  and  Tatyana  Nikitins. Lyrics played the most important role in Bard music, and bards used to be more like poets than musicians.\nGamelan gong kebyar is a style or  genre  of  Bali nese  gamelan   music .  Kebyar means \"the process of flowering\", and refers to the explosive changes in  tempo  and  dynamics  characteristic of the style. It is the most popular form of gamelan in Bali, and its best known musical export.\nPopular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound, with  samba  considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list.  Maracatu  and  Afox\u00ea  are two  Afro-Brazilian  music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual  Brazilian Carnival s. The sport of  capoeira  is usually played with its own music referred to as  capoeira music , which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music.\nCharya Geetika (poems of Buddhist literature), written between 7th to 12th century mostly by the poets of Odisha and Bengal, are connected with  Tantric Buddhism . All India literature on music like Bharat Muni's Natya Shastra, written in 2nd to 4th century AD., referred to the Odra Magadhi style of music and dance, which belonged to Odisha. Similarly, Sangeet Ratnakar also had a reference to the Odra Magadhi style of music. There are certain texts on Odissi music which are authentic and authoritative, and are excellent indices to the development of the music. These are written in Sanskrit or Oriya and contain the characteristics of Udramagadhi, Ardhamagadhi, Udra Bhasa and Utkalika Bibhasa. These were Oriya Charyagitika by different Oriya Sidhacharyas in the 7th to 11th centuries, Gita Govinda by Sri Jayadeva in the 12th century, Sangita Sara by Hari Nayak in the 14th century to 15th century, Rasavaridhi by Brundavan Das in the 15th century, Oriya Mahabharata by Sarala Das in the 15th century, Rasakallola by Dinakrushna Das in the 16th century, etc. Other books written in later years were Sangita Darpana, Sangit Kalpadruma, Sangitarnava Chandrika, Baidehisha Vilash, etc. It proves that Odissi music is more ancient than its counterparts like Hindustani or Carnatic\nBy the late 1980s, the field of ethnomusicology had begun examining  popular music  and the effect of media on musics around the world. Several definitions of popular music exist but most agree that it is characterized by having widespread appeal. Peter Manuel adds to this definition by distinguishing popular music by its association with different groups of people, performances by musicians not necessarily trained or intellectual, and dispersion through broadcasting and recording.  Theodor Adorno  defined popular music by contrasting it from serious music, which is purposeful and generally cooperates within strictly structured rules and conventions. Popular music can operate less deliberately and focuses on creating a general effect or impression, usually focusing on emotion.\nDistinctive styles of American popular music emerged early in the 19th century, and in the 20th century the American music industry developed a series of new forms of music, using elements of blues and other genres of American folk music. These popular styles included country, R&B, jazz and rock. The 1960s and 1970s saw a number of important changes in American popular music, including the development of a number of new styles, such as heavy metal, punk, soul, and hip hop.\nA clear judgment concerning the relation of serious music to popular music can be arrived at only by strict attention to the fundamental characteristic of popular music: standardization. [1] The whole structure of popular music is standardized, even where the attempt is made to circumvent standardization.\nPopular song redirects here. For other uses, see Popular Song (disambiguation). Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music.", "key": "40_2", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.062610", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
