{"input_text": "Captain America is seen as the leader of the  Avengers  during the  JLA/Avengers  story. His mind affected by subtle incompatibilities between the two universes, he sees the  Justice League  as overlords who demand praise and worship in return for heroic actions. He especially gets angry at  Superman , who (likewise affected) sees the Avengers as heroes who don't do enough and let their world down. During the first confrontation, Cap and  Batman  battle but reach a standstill, Batman saying it is conceivable Cap could beat him, but asks if he wants to. The two decide to team up to solve the mystery of the game. At the  Bat-Cave  Cap comments on the fact Batman lost  a partner , possibly thinking of  Bucky Barnes . They figure out the plan after Cap gets an inter-dimensional vehicle from the FF that allow them to get to the Grandmaster's headquarters, where they encounter the  Atom , who shows them recordings of the event, revealing the Avengers are fighting for  Krona . Their intervention in the last battle, where Cap makes sure Batman can get the cube so the JLA wins the game by using his shield to get the cube from Quicksilver, causes the villain Krona to go mad and attack the Grandmaster. Cap and Batman together convince the two teams to fight Krona. The Grandmaster then causes the two universes to merge, imprisoning Krona between them. Cap is the only Marvel hero to sense reality changing and his attack on Superman, who also realises the changes, shatters the fixed reality. He commands a group of heroes from both worlds in a wintry Metropolis when they are attacked by a group of villains. He and Superman again argue after he realizes Krona, from the DC Universe is responsible for the chaos, but are stopped by  Wonder Woman . The two teams find the  Grandmaster , who shows them the way their realities are supposed to be. Despite seeing shocking revelations, the two teams decide to face Krona. Cap leads the teams as a battle tactician at Superman's suggestion, communicating orders through the  Martian Manhunter 's telepathy, and gives Superman his shield. Before the battle he and Superman apologize to each other, claiming they each have fears of doing what the other accused them of. During the battle Cap is confronted by  Prometheus  after the Martian Manhunter is brought down by chronal chaos, whom he defeats despite them uploading Batman's skills after he gets his shield back. His ideas ultimately defeat Krona, after  Flash  and  Hawkeye  are nearly killed by  Dreamslayer , he tells them to pretend they are dead and lay low, they stop Krona's plan after he has defeated all the other heroes. Cap is among the core heroes at the end when reality is restored. He and Superman salute each other as they are transported back to their own dimensions, saying they fight on.\nBatman  fight crime in the city of  Gotham , his team is kept small, members of this team are Robin, Batgirl and the occasional assistance of Members of the justice league and former batman sidekicks like  Nightwing  who followed his crusade and moved to  bludhaven . Batman and his team fight crime through the city of Gotham trying to avoid the police department because they want to keep their identity a secret. Batman and his team share a similar back stories that shaped them to become heroes, batman and the first robin lost both their parents to criminals and vowed to do something about it without going down the path of murdering their enemies.\nAfter the comics publishing house  Marvel Comics  ventured into  movie production , they set of to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie  The Avengers  (2012). The same process was repeated for  Avengers: Age of Ultron  (2015) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the  Marvel Cinematic Universe . Inspired by Marvel's success,  Warner Bros. , who hold movie rights for  DC Comics ' heroes, announced the production of  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic  DC Extended Universe , while  Paramount Pictures  and  Allspark Pictures  announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the  Transformers  film series.\nMany superheroes work independently. However, there are also many superhero teams. Some, such as the  Fantastic Four ,  DNAgents , and the  X-Men , have common origins and usually operate as a group. Some are families in which the parents and kids have superpowers, like  The Incredibles . Others, such as  DC Comics \u2019s  Justice League  and  Marvel \u2019s  Avengers , are \"all-star\" groups consisting of heroes with separate origins who also operate individually, yet will  team up  to confront larger threats. The shared setting or \"universes\" of Marvel, DC and other publishers also allow for regular superhero  crossover  team-ups. Some superheroes, especially those introduced in the 1940s, work with a young  sidekick  (e.g.  Batman  and  Robin ,  Captain America  and  Bucky ). This has become less common since more sophisticated writing and older audiences have lessened the need for characters who specifically appeal to child readers. Sidekicks are seen as a separate classification of superheroes.\nOther comic book writing includes the award-winning  Earth X  trilogy with  Alex Ross  for  Marvel Comics , as well as  Avengers ,  X-Men ,  Star Wars ,  The Matrix Comics ,  Micronauts ,  Galactic , and  Batman .  Krueger And Alex Ross co wrote  Justice , and Avengers/Invaders,  Project Superpowers  (dynamite press)\nAlthough the film  Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance  was released on February 17, 2012 to little audience interest, the superhero genre dominated that year's lucrative summer film market with three superhero films occupying the top three positions of the box office chart  This includes the May 2012 release of  The Avengers . The Avengers broke the box office record as the highest-grossing superhero film of all time. The next Batman film from  Christopher Nolan ,  The Dark Knight Rises , is the sequel to  Christopher Nolan 's film  The Dark Knight , and was released on July 20, 2012 in the second position while the third was occupied by  reboot  of the Spider-Man franchise,  The Amazing Spider-Man , directed by  Marc Webb  and produced for  Columbia Pictures .\nMarvel and DC worked out several crossover titles the first of which was  Superman vs the Amazing Spider-Man . This was followed by Batman vs. Hulk, a second Superman and Spider-Man, and the  X-Men vs The New Teen Titans . Another title, The Avengers vs The Justice League of America was written by  Gerry Conway  and drawn by  George P\u00e9rez  with plotting by Roy Thomas but was never published, reflecting the later animosity between the two companies. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was not pleased that DC wanted the fourth company crossover to include the New Teen Titans, DC's best-selling title at the time, as he wanted the crossover to be the X-Men and the Legion of Super-Heroes. This led to Shooter's decision to stall and cancel the JLA/Avengers project.\nFifteen years prior to the events of DKR, Batman fires Dick (the reason is unknown, though Batman states it was for \"cowardice and incompetence\") and replaces him with  Jason Todd . Some time later, Bruce is involved in riots, during which he modifies the  Batmobile  to its tank-like structure. Batman later becomes a member of the JLA and seems to develops a strong friendship with  Hal Jordan  (also known as the  Green Lantern ), similar to his friendship with Superman in the Mainstream DC Universe, twelve years before DKR.\nDuring the crossover  JLA/Avengers , Batroc briefly confronted  Batman  when he was one of the villains recruited by  Krona  for his army. The Dark Knight defeated him (off-panel). Batroc's Brigade then face Batman, but he is assisted by  Black Panther ,  Huntress  and  Black Widow , in defeating the Brigade.\nThe Key next appears in  Gotham City , where he uses his psycho-chemicals to remove  Batman 's inhibition against killing. The Key's goal is to have Batman kill him, so that he might unlock the secret of death.   Batgirl  and  Azrael  must prevent Batman from committing murder until the drug wears off. The Key makes an appearance, along with a large group of villains, attacking the Justice League and the  Marvel Comics '  The Avengers  in 2003.\nThe premise of a Justice League-type super-team establishing a totalitarian state for what they see as the good of humanity was explored in  Marvel Comics ' original  Squadron Supreme  miniseries, its recent  reworking of that story , in  Wildstorm's   The Authority  and the \" Titans Tomorrow \" storyline of the  Teen Titans  comic book. The idea of  metahuman s taking control of humans, and of Superman leading them to make a better world, is also developed in the  Elseworlds  mini-series  Kingdom Come . According to Bruce Timm's DVD commentary, Batman was to form  Outsiders  as a counter-superteam of the Lords but the idea was discarded. In the  Avengers  Annual #2, the Avengers are sent to an alternate world by an early version of  Kang ; the original Avengers take over the world and imprison other super-beings, allegedly for their own good. The idea of altering criminals to prevent them from returning to crime was also part of the DC Comics mini-series  Identity Crisis  (albeit using magic and primarily intended to protect the heroes' secret identities) and in  Marvel Comics ' original  Squadron Supreme  miniseries.\nBatman states that his plans were a cautionary measure that he devised after the  Injustice League  swapped bodies with the Justice League with the aid of the alien tyrant  Agamemno  years earlier (during the  Silver Age  event). Recognizing the dangers of villains gaining control of the heroes, he created fail-safes in case such a situation ever happened again, the event also inspiring him to create plans to stop the other heroes if they should go rogue on their own. Due to Batman's secretive actions and measures placed against the JLA, the rest of the League vote on whether or not he should remain a member. Wonder Woman, Plastic Man and Aquaman vote for expulsion as they feel that they cannot trust Batman, while Flash, Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter vote against as they recognize that Batman had a point in his reasoning for developing the plans in the first place. It is left for Superman to cast the deciding vote. As they enter the room where Batman is held, the team realizes that he already foresaw how Superman would decide and therefore had already left. Superman is not surprised by this, later saying that Batman would know how he would vote.\nIn early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a fianc\u00e9e named  Julie Madison . In Detective Comics #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat,  Dick Grayson , who becomes his junior counterpart,  Robin . Batman also becomes a founding member of the  Justice Society of America , although he, like Superman, is an honorary member, and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of  Gotham City's police department . During this time,  Alfred Pennyworth  arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler.\nPlastic Man has also been instrumental in defeating several foes by himself, such as a  Jokerized  version of  Dr. Polaris  and the \u2018Burning Martian\u2019 persona of  J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz . He has played substantial roles in nearly every major team-up and crossover featuring the League of this era, such as with the  Titans  (\u2018The Technis Imperative\u2019),  Young Justice  (\u2018World Without Grownups\u2019), the  Justice Society of America  (\u2018Virtue and Vice\u2019, where he is one of the heroes to be possessed by one of the Seven Deadly Sins), the  Avengers  (the  JLA/Avengers  crossover) and even the  Looney Tunes  (in the humorous  Superman & Bugs Bunny  miniseries). In the \u2018 Tower of Babel \u2019 arc, Plastic Man is frozen and shattered into pieces by  Ra\u2019s al Ghul \u2019s League of Assassins, as part of an attack against the Justice League. Though he is put together again, this experience traumatizes him severely, and when it is discovered that the assassins were following methods devised by Batman, Eel joins  Wonder Woman  and  Aquaman  in voting Batman out of the League. The heroes reconcile in following issues.\nIn 2013, DC began publication of Batman '66, a comic book series telling all-new stories set in the world of the 1966\u201368 TV series.  Jeff Parker  writes the series, which features cover art by  Mike Allred  and interior art by different artists each issue. In the course of this series, the Bookworm, the Minstrel, Sandman, Olga Queen of the Cossacks, Zelda The Great, Shame, and Marsha Queen of Diamonds all have their first appearance in Batman comics. Penguin, Joker, Riddler, Catwoman and Mr. Freeze also appear in the series. Issue #3 of Batman '66 introduced the  Red Hood  and  Dr. Quinn  into the series continuity. In issue #7, Batman used a new vehicle, the Bat-Jet, to follow False-Face to Mount Rushmore. The series was to have introduced  Killer Croc  into the continuity, as well as a new villainess named Cleopatra. In April 2014, the first five issues were compiled into the Batman '66 Vol. 1 trade paperback.  Kevin Smith  and  Ralph Garman  likewise worked on a Batman and Green Hornet crossover, titled Batman '66 meets The Green Hornet. The six-issue mini-series began publication in June 2014.  Jeff Parker  wrote a Batman and  The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  team-up titled Batman '66 meets The Man from U.N.C.L.E. released in 2016. Ian Edginton wrote a Batman team up with  John Steed  and  Emma Peel  of  The Avengers  titled  Batman '66/Steed and Mrs. Peel. Batman will be teaming up with  Wonder Woman  in the crossover team up \"Batman' 66 Meets Wonder Woman '77 writing by both Parker and Marc Andreyko. Whether Batman '66 is represented in one of the current  New 52   DC Multiverse  alternative Earths is uncertain. Thus far, this has not been the case, although several such alternative Earths inhabitants and representative metahumans remain undisclosed.\nThe Avengers are a fictional team of  superhero es appearing in  American comic book s published by  Marvel Comics . The team made its debut in  The Avengers  #1 (Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor  Stan Lee  and artist/co-plotter  Jack Kirby , inspired by the success of  DC Comics '  Justice League of America .\nKyle Richmond, the original Nighthawk, debuted as a  supervillain  in the final panel of  The Avengers  #69 (Oct. 1969), a  superhero  team in the mainstream Marvel Comics continuity the company designates  Earth-616 . This story is the first chapter of a three-issue arc by writer  Roy Thomas  and penciller  Sal Buscema . The  story arc  introduced the  supervillain  team the  Squadron Sinister , whose four members were loosely based on heroes in  DC Comics '  Justice League of America , with Nighthawk based on  Batman .\nFrank Paur is an  American   television director  of animated  cartoons . He is best known for his work on  Batman: The Animated Series , the  Disney  animated series  Gargoyles ,  X-Men: Evolution , and  The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes .\nAlthough  Warner Brothers Animation 's  DC animated universe  was discontinued after the conclusion of  Justice League Unlimited  in 2006, the company continued with further series like  The Batman  and  Batman: The Brave and the Bold  which took a lighter thematic tone to the  DC Universe  adaptations. Currently, WB has returned to the DCAU franchise's more sophisticated standards with  Young Justice  with Greg Weisman producing. Likewise, Marvel Comics have continued with more younger appealing productions like  Iron Man: Armored Adventures ,  Ultimate Spider-Man  and  The Super Hero Squad Show  and more sophisticated series such as  The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes  and  The Spectacular Spider-Man\nBatman once again becomes a member of the  Justice League  during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's \" Cataclysm \" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's \" No Man's Land \".\nAn Avengers sequel, titled  Avengers: Age of Ultron  was released in May 2015. Following the success of the  Marvel Cinematic Universe , rival  DC Comics  also planned to make and produce their own shared film universe called the  DC Extended Universe  which began with the release of Man of Steel; a sequel titled  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  was schedule for release in May 2016, though it was later moved up to March 2016. Nickelodeon's 2015 film  The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water  features the main characters transform into superheroes.  20th Century Fox  rebooted the  Fantastic Four series  and released  Fantastic Four  in August 2015.\nSpider-Man is well received as a comic book character, always appearing as one of the greatest comic book characters or  superhero es of all time and almost always being the top Marvel Comics character. Spider-Man was declared the number one superhero on  Bravo 's Ultimate Super Heroes, Vixens, and Villains TV series in 2005.  Empire  magazine placed him as the fifth-greatest comic book character of all time.  Wizard  magazine placed Spider-Man as the third greatest comic book character on their website. In 2011, Spider-Man placed third on  IGN 's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, behind  DC Comics  characters  Superman  and  Batman . and sixth in their 2012 list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\". In 2014, IGN identified Spider-Man the greatest Marvel Comics character of all time. A 2015 poll at  Comic Book Resources  named Spider-Man the greatest Marvel character of all time. IGN described him as the common everyman that represents many normal people but also noting his uniqueness compared to many top-tiered superheroes with his many depicted flaws as a superhero. IGN also noted that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time that he is \"one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence.\" Empire noted and praised that despite the many tragedies that Spider-Man faces that he retains his sense of humour at all times with his witty wisecracks. The magazine website also praised the depiction of his \"iconic\" superhero poses describing it as \"a top artist's dream\".\nThe second version is Lex Luthor himself, voiced by  Kevin Michael Richardson . This version is portrayed with an fat chin, and appears in the third season episodes \"Battle of the Superheroes!\" and \"Triumvirate of Terror!\". In \"Battle of the Superheroes!\", he robs a museum and kidnaps  Lois Lane  only to be thwarted by Superman and arrested by the police. When Lois unknowingly receives a Red Kryptonite necklace, it causes Superman to turn evil causing Batman and  Krypto the Superdog  to hold off Superman until the effects wore off. They discovered that the real Lex is still at large, having been the one who mailed Lois the Red Kryptonite necklace and that the one in jail was a robotic duplicate. When Lex tries to use his Kryptonite ring on Superman, it does not work due to the fact that Superman was actually Batman in disguise. Lex is defeated by Batman and Superman. In \"Triumvirate of Terror!\", Luthor is seen as the leader of the  Legion of Doom . He competes with the Joker,  Cheetah  (Priscilla Rich),  Weather Wizard ,  Felix Faust  and AMAZO against the  Justice League International , including Robin,  Kid Flash , Superman, Batman,  Wonder Woman ,  Booster Gold  and  Green Arrow , plays a game of baseball, with  Jimmy Olsen  as the host. During the game, Luthor tries to cheat his way to victory, but the Justice League still defeats him and the Legion of Doom. Later, after Luthor is again defeated by Superman in battle in Metropolis, he meets up with Joker and Cheetah at the Legion of Doom Headquarters. They team up to defeat the heroes by forming a strategy of attacking a different hero: \u201cSuperman vs Cheetah\u201d, \u201cWonder Woman vs Joker\u201d and \u201cBatman vs Luthor\u201d. Luthor, wearing his battle suit, ambushes Batman in the  Batcave . After being halted off by Batman's  butler  who wore the Batman suit and fought Luthor to protect Batman's secret identity, the real Batman fights Luthor in the Batcave, despite his speed and skill, Batman is defeated by Luthor and knocked unconscious. When the villains complete their objectives and the heroes are captured, Luthor sends a broadcast to all of the universe, telling everyone that they will destroy the Justice League in front of the entire universe (including Rohtul seeing the broadcast from Zur-En-Arrh). But Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman free themselves and fight the villains. Superman once again fights Luthor, but this time, Luthor gained the upperhand and overpowered Superman. However, Superman quickly revived, knocks Luthor to the Wall with his Super breath and rematched Luthor. After defeating Cheetah with Wonder Woman and Batman, Superman fights Luthor again and Superman defeats Luthor by knocking him down and destroying his power suit. This leaves Luthor vulnerable and Batman finishes Luthor off with a powerful blow, defeating him. Luthor, Joker and Cheetah, following their defeats at the heroes hands, are trapped by Superman with a rope.\nIn its most recent formation the group's leadership was relinquished by  Nightwing  to Batman, who recruited former members and newcomers. He has stated his intention to use the team as a  black op s version of the Justice League, able to take the proverbial \"fall\" in public opinion when the League cannot. After Batman's (apparent) death in  Final Crisis , he posthumously charged  Alfred Pennyworth  with recruiting a new team of Outsiders for a forthcoming mission of \"great importance\".\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in  World's Finest Comics , starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the  Justice League of America , Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's  Brave and the Bold  #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different  DC Universe  superhero each month.\nIn  JLA/Avengers  #4 (2004), part of the Marvel/ DC  co-published crossover series, the Taskmaster is among the supervillains to confront  Batman ,  Black Panther ,  Black Widow  and  Huntress  in the final battle with  Krona .\nMembers of each team were pitted against members of the other. The Avengers, for their part, were told it was in order to stop Loki, and to save the Black Knight, while the members of Ultraforce were told that the Avengers were part of an invading force.\nIn the animated series Batman Beyond, Batman battled different versions of the gang on several occasions. In a Justice League Unlimited episode the member Ghoul stated that there are 9,453 active Jokerz that are divided into approximately 200 separate groups (however, it is likely that the proliferation of the Jokerz membership is due to Chronos' manipulation of the time stream).\nOn October 27, 2014, Cartoon Network aired the television special  Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leaguered  which details Superman wanting to recruit Batman into the Justice League while he is fighting Penguin and other villains over a gem, but he refuses the league. When Superman mysteriously goes missing, Batman recruits Flash to help find him. With nothing to report, they run into Captain Cold, who is trying to steal an Atlantean pillar in a desert. After a fight which results in the Batwing getting destroyed and Flash mysteriously disappearing, Batman defeats Cold, only for him and the pillar to go missing as well. He goes to Aquaman in the sea, who fights Black Manta for the trident of Poseidon, but he goes through a similar situation, where Aquaman disappears, Batman defeats Manta, and then he and the trident are warped away. Realizing that the Justice League is the target and not the artifacts Batman goes to Wonder Woman and Cyborg, who are fighting Luthor in Metropolis. As Luthor reveals an anonymous buyer wants the daily planet globe, Wonder Woman and Cyborg disappear, leaving Batman to defeat Luthor, only for him and the globe to disappear. Batman realizes that the plot was by  Bat-Mite  and it was to abduct the members of the Justice League and so that Batman can be the number one superhero in the universe.\nBatman angers several members, who feel he has no right to remove people already on the team. Captain Boomerang leaves the team for  Amanda Waller 's Suicide Squad, and Nightwing decides to take no part in the Outsiders' questionable activities. Katana is chosen as the team's first official member, joined later by the  Martian Manhunter , Metamorpho and  Grace .  Thunder  is kicked off the team; the second  Aquaman  is rejected because Batman feels he doesn't match up to his predecessor,  Orin . Batman then tells the other members, \"Whether you like it or not, you're here to save the world. And you're going to be hated for it\". After the team's first official mission (in Outsiders #50),  Catwoman  overheard the other recruits talking about the team being \"down by law,\" and said, \"Batman can't possibly start up his own crew of super-crooks without me in it!\"\nIn the  Batman Beyond  two-part \"The Call\", Warhawk is a member of  Justice League Unlimited  (the Justice League of the future) alongside  Big Barda ,  Green Lantern  (Kai-ro) and  Aquagirl  (Marina). He was initially at odds with  Batman  (Terry McGinnis) because he had been recruited onto the team by  Superman  without the rest of the JLU's consent. But after Batman proved himself to be a competent and trustworthy member against  Starro , Warhawk's attitude shifted from reluctant ally to devoted teammate. They would eventually become close comrades and colleagues.\nAround the time the Steel series was cancelled, Steel was recruited as a member of the Justice League, due to  Batman 's concern that the League was already top-heavy in brawn and required more thinkers. During his time in the League, Steel played a crucial role in the defeat of villains such as  Prometheus  and the  Queen Bee . He even served as the leader of the reserve team\u2014 consisting of  Huntress ,  Barda ,  Plastic Man , and  Zauriel \u2014 left in the present during the  DC One Million  crisis. Following the battle against  Mageddon , he ceased to serve as a full-time member of the League, although he stayed on as a supporting member for quite some time. He also became a regular member in the Superman titles, having relocated with Nat to Metropolis to run his own workshop there, called \"Steelworks.\" He also revealed at this time that he had known Superman's identity for some time. The two became partners of a sort, and John Henry helped Superman build a new  Fortress of Solitude , although he maintained some contacts with the Justice League, as shown when he was able to contact Batman to help Superman find  Lois Lane  after she had been abducted by the  Parasite .\nThe launch issue of the story-arc was DC Comics' best-selling title in October, selling an estimated 118,860 units. It was the sixth-best selling title overall, behind the first issue of the  AXIS  X-Men and Avengers storyline (138,966),  Death of Wolverine  #3 (141,567), the launch of the female-led  Thor  (150,862), Death of Wolverine #4 (165,582), and  The Walking Dead  #134 (326,334). Batman #36 was DC Comics' top-selling title of November, and the third highest-selling title of the month with an estimated 115,183 units. Batman #37 was the best-selling comic of December with an estimated 113,255 units sold. Alongside  The Amazing Spider-Man s 104,739 units, it was the only other title to sell more than 100,000 units that month. Batman #38 was one of only four comics to sell more than 75,000 units in January, moving approximately 110,232 units ahead of The Amazing Spider-Man #12 (105,458) and #13 (103,093), and behind Star Wars #1 (985,976). This also made it DC Comics best selling title of the month. For February, Batman #39 was DC Comics best-selling title and the fifth-best selling title based on 118,106 units sold.\nBatman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the  Justice League of America  and the  Outsiders . Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of World's Finest and  Superman/Batman  series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In  Superman/Batman  #3 (December 2003),  Superman  observes, \"Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him.\"\nSince 2009, Shinick has written comics for both  Marvel Comics  and  DC Comics , beginning with DC's annual Batman 80-Page Giant and continuing on to DC's \"Joker's Asylum II: Clayface,\" Marvel Comics' \" Avenging Spider-Man ,\" \" Superior Carnage ,\" \" Superior Spider-Man Team-Up  and \"AXIS: Hobgoblin.\"\nIn April 2014, the first five issues were compiled into the Batman '66 Vol. 1 trade paperback. Additional volumes collecting further issues have since been released. In June 2014,  Kevin Smith  and  Ralph Garman 's six-issue Batman and  Green Hornet  crossover mini-series, Batman '66 meets The Green Hornet, began publication. There are also three other crossovers with fellow 60's & 70's TV shows; \" The Man From U.N.C.L.E. \" with Batman '66 Meets the Man From U.N.C.L.E.,  TV's \"The Avengers\"  with Batman '66 Meets Steed and Mrs. Peel, and \" Wonder Woman \", as played by  Lynda Carter , in Batman '66 Meets Wonder Woman '77.\nThe  superhero   Batman  has appeared in  American comic book s published by  DC Comics  since 1939, accumulating a number of recognizable  supporting character s. The first Batman supporting character was  Commissioner James Gordon , who first appeared in the same comic book as Batman in  Detective Comics  #27 (May 1939), and is Batman's ally in the  Gotham City Police Department .  Robin , Batman's vigilante partner, was introduced in the Spring of 1940,  Alfred Pennyworth , Batman's butler, was introduced in 1943, and  Barbara Gordon  was introduced in 1967. Batman also forms strong bonds or close working relationships with other superheroes, including  Justice League  members  Superman ,  Green Arrow  and  Zatanna , as well as members of the  Outsiders  superhero team. Others such as  Jason Bard ,  Harold ,  Onyx , and  Toyman  work for him.\nSince 1939, Bat-fans have been fascinated by the saga of a man who dresses like a bat in order to inspire fear in the hearts of criminals. It's a saga that has played out in every form of media. Unlike most of DC's heroes, Batman has no superhuman abilities. He merely has the training, the resources, and most importantly, the will to wage a one-man war on crime. And it's a testament to that will that no one ever questions whether Batman has what it takes to stand alongside the rest of the Justice League.\nBatman is a 1966 American superhero film based on the Batman television series, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the DC Comics character Batman. Released by 20th Century Fox, the film starred Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin. The film hit theaters two months after the last episode of the first season of the television series. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the exception of Lee Meriwether as the Catwoman, the character previously played by\nThe Avengers are a fictional team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, inspired by the success of DC Comics' Justice League of America. Labeled Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers originally consisted of Hank Pym, the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and the Wasp.\nThis is why Superman once called Batman the most dangerous man in the world. You don't get Supes saying that without having some amazing powers.
