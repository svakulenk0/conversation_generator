Canned  or  frozen  corn and other canned foods such as tomato are sometimes used to prepare corn stew.

It is served with dumplings ( pelmeni ,  pierogi ,  varenyky ), or with pancakes ( bliny ,  nale\u015bniki ,  oladyi ,  syrniki ). It is also used as a filling in savoury pancakes. Smetana can be blended to a  Liptauer -like  cheese spread  with  quark  or  cottage cheese s, onions, paprika and other spices, and eaten with bread.

It is used in the preparation of meat stews, such as  beef Stroganoff , vegetable stews,  casserole s, or other dishes that require a long cooking time in the oven. Smetana does not melt in the oven.

This distinguishes a potjiekos from a stew that is stirred. The aim is that the flavours of the different ingredients mix as little as possible. Although some chefs may permit stirring from time to time (which is highly frowned upon), it does create a stew where all the ingredients tend to blend together and taste similar. This is also the main difference between a stew and potjiekos i.e. in a potjie you do not stir. The reason for this is so that the flavour from the meat at the bottom can flavour all the vegetables above while slow cooking. If your potjie is made properly you should still be able to see and taste all the ingredients separately as well as a delicious whole.
