{"input_text": "The exact mechanisms and histogenesis of lung cancers are topics of intense interest and research. It is currently thought that most cases of lung cancer probably occur after damage to genomic  DNA  causes  malignant transformation  of a single  multipotent   cell . This newly formed entity, sometimes referred to as a  cancer stem cell , then begins to divide uncontrollably, giving rise to new daughter cancer cells in an  exponential  (or near exponential) fashion. Unless this runaway  cell division  process is checked, a clinically apparent tumor will eventually form as the mass reaches sufficient size to be detected clinically, or begins to cause  signs or symptoms. Approximately 98% of lung cancers are eventually diagnosed as a  histological  variant of  carcinoma , a term that signifies that the tumor derives from transformed  epithelial  cells, or cells that have acquired epithelial characteristics as a result of cell  differentiation .\nGefitinib is well endured by humans, and treatment resulted in a symptom improvement rate of 43% (with 95% confidence in a 33%-53% interval) for patients that received 250 mg of Gefitinib and 35% (with 95% confidence in a 26%-45% interval) for those that received 500 mg. In the trial, epidermal growth factor receptor showed a rapid response to the inhibitor, as demonstrated by the improvement of the cancer symptoms. In each group, improvements were noted after a single week of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Gefitinib application once per day caused \u201crapid\u201d symptom improvement and tumor regressions in non-small cell lung cancer patients. In the field of medical research, this is an especially significant example of the use of an inhibitor to treat tyrosine kinase-associated cancer. Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy were the only major options available prior to the discoveries made in this trial. The side-effects of Gefitinib oral treatment once per day were considered significant. Diarrhea was reported in 57% of patients in the 250 mg group and in 75% of the 500 mg group. One patient had diarrhea more severe than Grade 2, with up to six bowel movements in only one day. Also, a death occurred possibly due to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment; however, the correlation is not exactly clear. In addition, skin toxicity was observed in 62% of patients in the 250 mg group. Nevertheless, the side-effects of Gefitinib were only \u201cgenerally mild, manageable, noncumulative, and reversible.\u201d Unfortunately, ceasing to take the inhibitor may be the only reversal strategy of the unfavorable symptoms. Gefitinib still represents a reasonably safe and effective treatment compared to other cancer therapies.\nMany of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches,  fainting ,  convulsion s, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone,  adrenal gland s, opposite lung, liver,  pericardium , and  kidney s. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.\nThe most common cancers associated with paraneoplastic neurological disorders are  breast ,  ovarian  and  lung cancer , but many other cancers can produce paraneoplastic symptoms as well.\nLocal symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. For example, mass effects from  lung cancer  can block the  bronchus  resulting in  cough  or  pneumonia ;  esophageal cancer  can cause narrowing of the  esophagus , making it difficult or painful to swallow; and  colorectal cancer  may lead to narrowing or blockages in the  bowel , affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps.  Ulceration  can cause bleeding that, if it occurs in the lung, will lead to  coughing up blood , in the bowels to  anemia  or  rectal bleeding , in the bladder to  blood in the urine  and in the uterus to vaginal bleeding. Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial swelling is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or  abdomen .\nDepending on the type of tumor,  paraneoplastic phenomena \u2014symptoms not due to the local presence of cancer\u2014may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include  hypercalcemia ,  syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone  (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic  ACTH  production, or  Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome  (muscle weakness due to  autoantibodies ). Tumors in the  top of the lung , known as  Pancoast tumor s, may invade the local part of the  sympathetic nervous system , leading to  Horner's syndrome  (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the  brachial plexus .\nOften AGID is a symptom of other problems, including  colon cancer ,  lupus , lung, breast, or  ovarian   carcinoma  or  thymoma . or other diseases.  Irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS) is the most recognized form of AGID.\nOccasionally, breast cancer presents as  metastatic  disease\u2014that is, cancer that has spread beyond the original organ. The symptoms caused by  metastatic breast cancer  will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung and brain. Unexplained weight loss can occasionally signal breast cancer, as can symptoms of fevers or chills. Bone or joint pains can sometimes be manifestations of metastatic breast cancer, as can jaundice or neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called  non-specific , meaning they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.\nWhen eosinophilic pneumonia is related to an illness such as cancer or parasitic infection, treatment of the underlying cause is effective in resolving the lung disease. When due to AEP or CEP, however, treatment with  corticosteroid s results in a rapid, dramatic resolution of symptoms over the course of one or two days. Either  intravenous   methylprednisolone  or oral  prednisone  are most commonly used. In AEP, treatment is usually continued for a month after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four weeks total). In CEP, treatment is usually continued for three months after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four months total). Inhaled steroids such as  fluticasone  have been used effectively when discontinuation of oral prednisone has resulted in  relapse .Because EP affects the lungs, individuals with EP have difficulty breathing. If enough of the lung is involved, it may not be possible for a person to breathe without support. Non-invasive machines such as a  bilevel positive airway pressure  machine may be used. Otherwise, placement of a  breathing tube  into the mouth may be necessary and a  ventilator  may be used to help the person breathe.\nLung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant  lung tumor  characterized by uncontrolled  cell growth  in  tissues  of the  lung . If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of  metastasis  into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most  cancer s that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are  carcinomas . The two main types are  small-cell lung carcinoma  (SCLC) and  non-small-cell lung carcinoma  (NSCLC). The most common  symptom s are coughing (including  coughing up blood ), weight loss, shortness of breath, and  chest pain s.\nIn LEMS associated with lung cancer, most have no suggestive symptoms of cancer at the time, such as  cough ,  coughing blood  and  unintentional weight loss . It has been suggested that LEMS associated with lung cancer is more severe.\nMesothelioma is a type of  cancer  that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the  mesothelium ). The most common area affected is the  lining of the lungs and chest wall . Less commonly the  lining of the abdomen  and rarely the  sac surrounding the heart , or the  sac surrounding the testis  may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include  shortness of breath  due to  fluid around the lung , a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly.\nCancer symptoms are changes in the body caused by the presence of  cancer . They are usually caused by the effect of a  cancer  on the part of the body where it is growing, although the  disease  can cause more general symptoms such as  weight loss  or tiredness. There are more than 100 different types of  cancer  with a wide range of different signs and symptoms which can manifest in different ways.\nIf the cancer has spread elsewhere, symptoms related to  metastatic disease  may appear. Common sites of spread include nearby  lymph node s, the  liver ,  lungs  and bone.   Liver metastasis  can cause  jaundice  and abdominal swelling ( ascites ). Lung metastasis can cause, among other symptoms, impaired breathing due to excess fluid around the lungs ( pleural effusion ), and  dyspnea  (the feelings often associated with impaired breathing).\nLung cancer is one of the most lethal and common forms of cancer worldwide. Pollution, smoking (active and  passive ),  radiation  (in the form of x-rays or gamma rays) and  asbestos  are risk factors for lung cancer. Symptoms may include persistent cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, fatigue, and swelling of the neck and face. There are different types of lung cancers, which can  metastasize . Treatments include  chemotherapy , surgery, and  radiation . The treatment aimed at killing the cancer can also eliminate functioning lung cells (leukocytes).Specific genetic factors can add to the risk of developing lung cancer. There are regions on chromosomes which are highly susceptible to mutation and, if present, increase the risk of developing lung cancer. These loci are the specific locations of a gene or a DNA sequence on a chromosome. Several loci are associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer.Approximately 26 different genes can mutate into one type of lung cancer, known as carcinoma. An example is the MAP pathway, which is inhibited by ME (a lung cancer treatment). The risk of developing lung cancer is higher for those with a family history of the disease. A second way the risk could go up is if the individual lives with a smoker.\nAsbestos can cause  lung cancer  that is identical to lung cancer from other causes. Exposure to asbestos is associated with all major histological types of lung carcinoma  ( adenocarcinoma ,  squamous cell carcinoma ,  large-cell carcinoma  and  small-cell carcinoma ). The latency period between exposure and development of lung cancer is 20 to 30 years. It is estimated that 3%-8% of all lung cancers are related to asbestos. The risk of developing lung cancer depends on the level, duration, and frequency of asbestos exposure (cumulative exposure). Smoking and individual susceptibility are other contributing factors towards lung cancer. Smokers who have been exposed to asbestos are at far greater risk of lung cancer. Smoking and asbestos exposure have a multiplicative ( synergistic ) effect on the risk of lung cancer. Symptoms include chronic cough, chest pain, breathlessness,  haemoptysis  (coughing up blood), wheezing or hoarseness of the voice, weight loss and fatigue. Treatment involves surgical removal of the cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these (multimodality treatment). Prognosis is generally poor unless the cancer is detected in its early stages. Out of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer, only 15% survive for five years after diagnosis.\nLEMS is often associated with lung cancer (50\u201370%), specifically  small-cell carcinoma , making LEMS a  paraneoplastic syndrome . Of the people with small cell lung cancer, 1\u20133% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the lung cancer, and it is otherwise  asymptomatic .\nThe most common symptoms of lung cancer are persistent coughing; pain in the chest, shoulder or back from coughing; change in the colour of mucus; difficulty in breathing or swallowing; hoarseness of the voice; harsh sound while breathing; chronic bronchitis or pneumonia; and coughing up blood.\nLung Cancer Symptoms. Lung cancer often has no symptoms until it has spread (metastasized).This is because there are few specialized nerves (pain receptors) in the lungs. When lung cancer symptoms do occur, they vary depending on the type of lung cancer and location and size of the tumor.\nA vocal cord polyp is a noncancerous growth on the vocal cord causing breathiness, hoarseness, and more. Small cell lung cancer is the least common type of lung cancer and can cause a cough, chest pain, and more. Symptoms of swallowing an object include coughing, choking, vomiting, throat pain, breathing trouble, and more.\nProgressing Toward Death. When treatment for lung cancer has failed to stop advancement of the disease, a few main symptoms are of most concern. Pain at the primary cancer site and in any place where it has spread is the first symptom that needs the attention of the treating health care providers and family members.rogressing Toward Death.

Pain at the primary cancer site and in any place where it has spread is the first symptom that needs the attention of the treating health care providers and family members.\nSmall cell lung cancer staging. Small cell lung cancer stages are classified in one of two ways: 1  Limited stage: Cancer is in one lung, sometimes including nearby lymph nodes. 2  Extensive stage: Cancer has spread to the other lung, the fluid around the lung (the pleura) or to other organs in the body.ung cancer stages.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, and while often treatable, it frequently progresses and causes death.\nLung cancer can affect nerves that line to the larynx (the voice box) There are some cancers that can cause hoarseness. These include cancers of larynx, throat, lungs, lymphomas, and thyroid. Even sometime a hoarse voice can be the first symptom of these cancers. The metastatic cancer can have an effect, too.\nThe most common symptoms of lung cancer are: 1  A cough that does not go away or gets worse. 2  Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing. 3  Hoarseness. 4  Weight loss and loss of appetite.\nThe most common symptoms of lung cancer are: 1  A cough that does not go away or gets worse. 2  Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing. 3  Hoarseness. 4  Weight loss and loss of appetite. 5  Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (spit or phlegm).\n1 There are two main types of small cell lung cancer. 2  Smoking increases the risk of small cell lung cancer. 3  Signs and symptoms of small cell lung cancer include coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. 4  Tests and procedures that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage small cell lung cancer.

Lung cancer may or may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, blood in the mucus, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck.\nSigns and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur only when the disease is advanced. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer may include: A new cough that doesn't go away. Changes in a chronic cough or smoker's cough. Coughing up blood, even a small amount. Shortness of breath. Chest pain.\nSigns and symptoms of lung cancer may include: 1  A new cough that doesn't go away. 2  Changes in a chronic cough or smoker's cough. 3  Coughing up blood, even a small amount.

Symptoms of heartburn and GERD are a burning feeling in the chest, throat, or mouth, nausea, and more. Small cell lung cancer is the least common type of lung cancer and can cause a cough, chest pain, and more.\nLung cancer symptoms Symptoms of lung cancer vary depending on whether the disease is in its early or late stages. In early stage (stage 1 and stage 2) lung cancer, the cancerous tumor is typically no bigger than 2 inches and hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spread to your lymph nodes. Minor symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath, may appear during this time.\nLung cancer usually grows for many years without causing signs or symptoms. However, eventually nearly all people with lung cancer develop symptoms associated with. the disease. Only 5% of people newly diagnosed with lung cancer do not have symptoms of.\nLung cancer symptoms. The early symptoms of lung cancer may be a slight cough or shortness of breath, depending on which part of the lung is affected. As the cancer develops, these symptoms may become more severe or intense. Like many other types of cancer, lung cancer may also cause systemic symptoms, like a loss of appetite or general fatigue.\nAs other parts of the body are affected, new lung cancer symptoms may develop, including: 1  Bone pain. 2  Swelling of the face, arms or neck. 3  Headaches, dizziness or limbs that become weak or numb. 4  Jaundice. Lumps in the neck or collar bone region.\nWheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pains are other ignored symptoms of lung cancer. Other signs include loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, fatigue, difficulty in swallowing, hoarse voice, joint pain, facial paralysis, drooping eyelids, or bone pain.ymptoms & Stages of Lung Cancer. It usually starts as a cough or shortness of breath. Chest pains follow. More signs and symptoms come. Each year, lung cancer kills 1.3 million people\u00e2\u0080\u0094the same as the population of Hawaii\u00e2\u0080\u0094making it the most common cause of cancer-related death (Lung Cancer Research Foundation, 2012).\nSymptoms.

The symptoms of lung cancer are caused by the primary tumor or by metastatic disease. The primary tumor may press on, invade, or damage surrounding tissues, blood vessels, or nerves. Metastatic lung cancer may cause similar problems in other parts of the body. As many as 10% of people with lung cancer have no symptoms.\nEducating yourself about lung cancer: Signs and symptoms: Headache. Headache. Definition. A headache is pain or discomfort in the head, scalp, or neck. Serious causes of headaches are extremely rare. Most people with headaches can feel much better by making lifestyle changes, learning ways to relax, and occasionally by taking medications. See also: 1  Tension headache. 2  Cluster headache. 3  Migraine with aura.\nLung cancer symptoms The early symptoms of lung cancer may be a slight cough or shortness of breath, depending on which part of the lung is affected. As the cancer develops, these symptoms may become more severe or intense. Like many other types of cancer, lung cancer may also cause systemic symptoms, like a loss of appetite or general fatigue.\nSigns of advanced stages of lung cancer. Advanced stages of lung cancer are often characterized by the spread of the cancer to distant sites in the body. This may affect the bones, liver or brain. As other parts of the body are affected, new lung cancer symptoms may develop, including: Bone pain; Swelling of the face, arms or neck\nSymptoms of lung cancer in women can differ from symptoms of lung cancer in men. One of the reasons that symptoms can lung cancer symptoms in women differ between the sexes is that most common types of lung cancer vary between sexes and also different types of lung cancer tend to have different symptoms.\n2. Chronic cough or chest pain. Several types of cancer, including leukemia and lung tumors, can cause symptoms that mimic a bad cough or bronchitis. One way to tell the difference: The problems persist, or go away and come back again in a repeating cycle. Some lung cancer patients report chest pain that extends up into the shoulder or down the arm. For Women Only: Cancer Symptoms You're Most Likely to Ignore. 3. Swallowing problems or hoarseness. Most commonly associated with esophageal or throat cancer, difficulty swallowing is sometimes one of the first signs of lung cancer, too.\n15 Common Symptoms of Cancer. There are several common symptoms of cancer, but there are few that are specific to cancer. In other words, for each of the most common symptoms of cancer there can be causes other than cancer, and these other causes are often the most common cause.\nSigns and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: 1  Respiratory symptoms: coughing, coughing up blood, wheezing, or shortness of breath. 2  Systemic symptoms: weight loss, weakness, fever, or clubbing of the fingernails.\nSigns and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected. Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include: 1  Fatigue. 2  Lump or area of thickening that can be felt under the skin. 3  Weight changes, including unintended loss or gain. 4  Skin changes, such as yellowing, darkening or redness of the skin, sores that won't heal, or changes to existing moles.\nColon cancer is divided into 5 stages, from stage 0 to stage 4. Stage 4 colon cancer (earlier known as Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s D colon cancer) is the last stage of this cancer. At this stage of the cancer, the cancer is said to have spread to other parts of the body, specifically the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. Abdominal discomfort: Pain, cramping, bloating, nausea and gas may be felt by those with colon cancer. 2  Jaundice: Since the colon cancer has normally spread to the liver by stage 4, jaundice is also a symptom. 3  Other symptoms include unexplained fever, weight loss, fatigue, thrombosis.\nSmall cell lung cancer accounts for 10%\u00e2\u0080\u009315% of all lung cancers. It usually starts in the bronchi in the centre of the lungs. Small cell lung cancer is the most aggressive of all types of lung cancer.In many cases, it has spread to other parts of the body by the time it is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer is also known as oat cell carcinoma or small cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Stage is the most important prognostic factor for small cell lung cancer. 2  Limited stage cancers have a much better prognosis than extensive stage cancers. 3  Most people with small cell lung cancer are diagnosed with extensive stage cancer because the cancer spreads early and quickly, before it causes symptoms.\nDefinition. Pneumonitis (noo-moe-NIE-tis) is a general term that refers to inflammation of lung tissue. Although pneumonia is technically a type of pneumonitis because the infection causes inflammation, most doctors are referring to other causes of lung inflammation when they use the term pneumonitis..Factors that can cause pneumonitis include exposure to airborne irritants at your job or from your hobbies.In addition, some types of cancer treatments and dozens of drugs can cause pneumonitis. Difficulty breathing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often accompanied by a dry (nonproductive) cough \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the most common symptom of pneumonitis.actors that can cause pneumonitis include exposure to airborne irritants at your job or from your hobbies.

The symptoms of back pain related to lung cancer are diverse but have certain tell-tale signs. If it involves the spine, it can mimic many of the symptoms of an upper back injury. If it doesn't, the pain may be generalized like a muscle ache or sharp like a pinched nerve.\nThe most common symptoms of lung cancer are: 1  A cough that does not go away or gets worse. 2  Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing. 3  Hoarseness.4  Weight loss and loss of appetite.5  Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (spit or phlegm). 6  Shortness of breath. 7  Feeling tired or weak.he most common symptoms of lung cancer are: 1  A cough that does not go away or gets worse. 2  Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing. 3  Hoarseness.\nThe most common symptoms of lung cancer include the following: cough, blood in sputum (hemoptysis), change in breathing (shortness of breath or wheezing), chest pain, voice change (hoarseness), headache, weight loss, fatigue and swelling of the face or neck.\nThe signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the stage of cancer. The most common signs are lumps in the neck, trouble in swallowing, sore throat, hoarseness, disfigurement of the neck or face, hardening of the skin, coughing up blood, and ear pain.hroat Cancer Prognosis-Stage 4. With a survival rate of almost 30%, stage 4 throat cancer is a matter of grave concern. At this stage, the cancer has already spread to the lymph nodes and other organs.\nIt can be difficult to detect throat cancer in its early stages. Common signs and symptoms of throat cancer include: 1  a change in your voice. 2  trouble swallowing. 3  weight loss. 4  sore throat. 5  persistent cough (may cough up blood). 6  swollen lymph nodes in the neck.hese abnormal cells form malignant growths called tumors. Throat cancer refers to cancer of the voice box, the vocal cords, and other parts of the throat, such as the tonsils and the oropharynx. Raise money to cover your cancer treatment costs.\nThe signs and symptoms of throat cancer can be quite variable. The most common symptoms are a persistent sore throat, trouble swallowing, a lump in the neck, a change in voice, or ear pain.

It should be noted that whilst coughing up blood (haemoptysis) usually presenting as phlegm with blood in it, is perceived as being a sure sign of lung cancer, this is not always the case. There are many reasons why people cough up blood that have nothing to do with lung cancer. The most common reason is chest infection. Additional causes include nosebleeds, occasionally bleeding in the throat, irritation in the airways (tracheobronchitis) or inflammation of the stomach or oesophagus.\n1 Cancer symptoms and signs depend on the specific type and grade of cancer; general signs and symptoms are not very specific but are as follows: fatigue, weight loss, pain, skin changes, change in bowel or bladder function, unusual bleeding, persistent cough or voice change, fever, lumps, or tissue masses.

The symptoms of lung cancer depend on its type, its location, and the way it spreads. One of the more common symptoms is a persistent cough or, in people who have a chronic cough, a change in the character of the cough.\nCrepitus and Lung symptoms and Fatigue (4 causes) Crepitus and Lung symptoms and Joint symptoms (4 causes) Crepitus and Lung symptoms and Leg pain (4 causes) Crepitus and Lung symptoms and Movement symptoms (4 causes) Crepitus and Lung symptoms and Muscle symptoms (4 causes) Crepitus and Lung symptoms and Muscle weakness (4 causes) Crepitus and Lung symptoms and Musculoskeletal symptoms (4 causes) Crepitus and Lung symptoms and MORE SYMPTOMS.\nHemoptysis (coughing up blood) may occur when there is bleeding in the throat, the trachea (trachea), or in the large or small airways of the lungs (the bronchi or the bronchioles). Many people describe their symptom as spitting up blood-streaked mucus. Blood that is coughed up is often mixed with phlegm and can have a bubbly appearance. If you cough up blood it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily mean you have lung cancer. There are many conditions that can cause this symptom, and only one of these is lung cancer.\nCancers - Night sweats are an early symptom of some cancers. The most common type of cancer associated with night sweats is lymphoma. However, people who have an undiagnosed cancer frequently have other symptoms as well, such as unexplained weight loss and fevers.\nThe early stages of lung cancer may produce symptoms such as a cough, chest pain, and wheezing.

The early stages of lung cancer may produce symptoms such as a cough, chest pain, and wheezing.\nRecurring infections: Recurring infections, like bronchitis or pneumonia, may be one of the signs of lung cancer. Signs of advanced stages of lung cancer. Advanced stages of lung cancer are often characterized by the spread of the cancer to distant sites in the body. This may affect the bones, liver or brain. As other parts of the body are affected, new lung cancer symptoms may develop, including: Bone pain; Swelling of the face, arms or neck\nBronchial obstruction and Lung symptoms and Breathing difficulties (9 causes) Bronchial obstruction and Lung symptoms and Throat symptoms (9 causes) Bronchial obstruction and Lung symptoms and Cough (8 causes) Bronchial obstruction and Lung symptoms and Head symptoms (8 causes) Bronchial obstruction and Lung symptoms and Heart symptoms (8 causes) Bronchial obstruction and Lung symptoms and Skin symptoms (8 causes)\nDefinition. Pneumonitis (noo-moe-NIE-tis) is a general term that refers to inflammation of lung tissue. Although pneumonia is technically a type of pneumonitis because the infection causes inflammation, most doctors are referring to other causes of lung inflammation when they use the term pneumonitis.. Factors that can cause pneumonitis include exposure to airborne irritants at your job or from your hobbies. In addition, some types of cancer treatments and dozens of drugs can cause pneumonitis. Difficulty breathing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often accompanied by a dry (nonproductive) cough \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the most common symptom of pneumonitis. Specialized tests are necessary to make a diagnosis. Treatment focuses on avoiding irritants and reducing inflammation. 1  Symptoms.\nLung cancer (small cell) Small cell lung cancer is the least common type of lung cancer and can cause a cough, chest pain, and more.

Symptoms depend on the type and location of the tumor. For example, lung tumors may cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Tumors of the colon can cause weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, iron deficiency anemia, and blood in the stool. Some tumors may not cause any symptoms. Others, such as pancreatic cancer, do not usually cause symptoms until the disease has reached an advanced stage. The following symptoms may occur with tumors: 1  Chills. 2  Fatigue. 3  Fever. 4  Loss of appetite. 5  Malaise. 6  Night sweats. 7  Weight loss.\nThere two main types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These categories refer to what the cancer cells look like under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer. Staging. If lung cancer is diagnosed, other tests are done to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This process is called staging. The type and stage of lung cancer tells doctors what kind of treatment you need. For more information, visit Stages of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Stages of Small Cell Lung Cancer. Types of Treatment. Lung cancer is treated in several ways, depending on the type of lung cancer and how far it has spread. People with non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. People with small cell lung cancer are usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Surgery. An operation where doctors cut out cancer tissue. Chemotherapy. Using special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. The drugs can be pills you take or medicines given in your veins, or sometimes both. Radiation therapy. Using high-energy rays (similar to X-rays) to kill the cancer. Targeted therapy.\nSmall cell lung cancers often grow very close to the largest and most important blood vessels in the chest. It is not uncommon for a large vein called the superior vena cava to become blocked by a small cell tumor. This hinders blood flow from the head and brain back to the body. This problem is called superior vena cava syndrome and is a medical emergency. Symptoms include headache, a red face, a bloated look to the head, and bulging veins in the front of the chest and neck. Symptoms. A range of symptoms can suggest small cell lung cancer: A persistent cough\nCancer gives most people no symptoms or signs that exclusively indicate the disease. Unfortunately, every complaint or symptom of cancer can be explained by a harmless condition as well. If certain symptoms occur or persist, however, a doctor should be seen for further evaluation. Some common symptoms that may occur with cancer are as follows: Persistent cough or blood-tinged saliva. These symptoms usually represent simple infections such as bronchitis or sinusitis. They could be symptoms of cancer of the lung, head, and neck.\nHereditary Spastic Paraplegia: Symptom Checkers.

Signs and symptoms of lung cancer may include: A new cough that doesn't go away; Coughing up blood, even a small amount; Shortness of breath; Chest pain; Hoarseness; Losing weight without trying; Bone pain; Headache; When to see a doctor. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.\nAre you worried that your cough could be caused by lung cancer? Since lung cancer is most treatable in the early stages of the disease, finding a cancer as early as possible is extremely important. Unfortunately, there is no way to know conclusively if a cough is due to lung cancer based on symptoms alone.\nSeveral types of cancer, including leukemia and lung tumors, can cause symptoms that mimic a bad cough or bronchitis. One way to tell the difference: The problems persist, or go away and come back again in a repeating cycle. Some lung cancer patients report chest pain that extends up into the shoulder or down the arm.\nWhat Are the Most Common Mesothelioma Symptoms? Unfortunately, asbestosis and mesothelioma symptoms, mirror many other types of lung-related diseases. Symptoms can be different based on the type of cancer and can be vague and mild even as the disease progresses into a later stage. Early signs can be so slight that they are mistaken as normal aches and pains or symptoms of other illnesses, making asbestos-related cancer hard to detect.

Cancer is a group of diseases that can cause almost any sign or symptom. The signs and symptoms will depend on where the cancer is, how big it is, and how much it affects the organs or tissues. If a cancer has spread (metastasized), signs or symptoms may appear in different parts of the body. As a cancer grows, it can begin to push on nearby organs, blood vessels, and nerves. This pressure causes some of the signs and symptoms of cancer. If the cancer is in a critical area, such as certain parts of the brain, even the smallest tumor can cause symptoms. But sometimes cancer starts in places where it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause any signs or symptoms until it has grown quite large.\nThe signs and symptoms will depend on where the cancer is, how big it is, and how much it affects the organs or tissues.

Aug. 17, 2011 -- German researchers say that highly trained dogs are able to reliably sniff out lung cancer in human breath. In its early stages, lung cancer has few symptoms, making it difficult for doctors to catch it early, when it's still treatable.\nSigns and Symptoms of Small Cell Lung Cancer. Most lung cancers do not cause any symptoms until they have spread, but some people with early lung cancer do have symptoms. If you go to your doctor when you first notice symptoms, your cancer might be diagnosed at an earlier stage, when treatment is more likely to be effective.\nSymptoms of heartburn and GERD are a burning feeling in the chest, throat, or mouth, nausea, and more. Lung cancer (small cell) Small cell lung cancer is the least common type of lung cancer and can cause a cough, chest pain, and more. Pleural effusion.
