{"input_text": "Reticulocytes are immature  red blood cell s, typically composing about 1% of the red blood cells in the human body. In the process of  erythropoiesis  (red blood cell formation), reticulocytes develop and mature in the  bone marrow  and then  circulate  for about a day in the blood stream before developing into mature red blood cells. Like mature red blood cells, in mammals reticulocytes do not have a  cell nucleus . They are called reticulocytes because of a reticular (mesh-like) network of  ribosomal   RNA  that becomes visible under a  microscope  with certain  stains  such as  new methylene blue .\nThe fluids associated with the human body includes air, oxygen, carbondioxide, water, solvents, solutions, suspensions, serum, lymph and blood. The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is \"Blood\". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. The blood flow in arteries and veins are closely linked to the blood vessel properties.Carrying the oxygen and nutrients to various tissues and organs of our body, delivering carbon dioxide to the lungs and accepting oxygen, bringing the metabolic by products to the kidneys, regulating the body's defence mechanism, that is, the immune system and facilitating in effective heat and mass transfer across the body are some of the major functions which blood performs in the human body.Blood consists of the red blood cells or erythrocytes, white blood cells or leukocytes, and platelets or thrombocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide are known as Erythrocytes . The cells which are involved primarily in phagocytosis (the process of destruction of unknown particulate matter) and immune responses are known as Leukocytes; thrombocytes are the components of blood which are involved in blood clotting. In addition to these 55 to 60 percent of blood by volume consists of plasma. Plasma is the transparent, amber-colored liquid in which the cellular components of blood are suspended. Plasma contains  constituents such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and nutrients. Serum is blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed.Blood accounts for 6 to 8 percent of body weight in normal, healthy humans. The density of blood is slightly greater than the density of water at approximately 1060 kg/m3. The increased density comes from the increased density of a red blood cell compared with the density of water or plasma. Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter. Blood Rheology is the study of blood, especially the properties associated with the deformation and flow of blood. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid. However, often the non-Newtonian effect is very small due to various reasons. Thus, it is important to know about the blood rheology.One of the characteristics of blood that affects the work required to cause the blood to flow through the arteries is the viscosity of blood. The viscosity of blood is in the range of 3 to 6 cP, or 0.003 to 0.006 Ns/m2. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, which means that the viscosity of blood is not a constant with respect to the rate of shearing strain. In addition to the rate of shearing strain, the viscosity of blood is also dependent on temperature and on the volume percentage of blood that consists of red blood cells. If blood is made stationary for several seconds then clotting begins in the blood, as a result of which the viscosity of the blood increases. When stationary state is disturbed with increasing shear rate, the clot formation is destroyed and the viscosity decreases. Moreover, the orientation of red blood cells present in the blood also effect the viscosity of blood. Thus, we can say that blood is a shear thinning fluid, i.e., viscosity decreases with increase in shear rate. Beyond a shear rate of about 100s^-1, the viscosity is nearly constant and the blood behaves like a Newtonian fluid. Blood is a viscoelastic material, i.e., viscous and elastic because the effective viscosity of blood not only depends on the shear rate but also on the history of shear rate.It is also important to note that the normal blood flows much more easily compared to rigid particles, for the same particle volume fraction. This is due to the fact that red blood cells can accommodate by deforming in order to pass by one another.\nRed blood cells are also known as RBCs, red cells, red blood corpuscles, haematids, erythroid cells  or erythrocytes (from  Greek  erythros for \"red\" and kytos for \"hollow vessel\", with -cyte translated as \"cell\" in modern usage).  Packed red blood cells  (pRBC) are red blood cells that have been donated, processed, and stored in a  blood bank  for  blood transfusion .\nBlood tests are also used in diagnosis. Primary myelofibrosis can begin with a blood picture similar to that found in  polycythemia vera  or  chronic myelogenous leukemia . Most people with myelofibrosis have moderate to severe anemia. Eventually  thrombocytopenia , a decrease of  blood platelets  develops. When viewed through a microscope, a  blood smear  will appear markedly abnormal, with presentation of  pancytopenia , which is a reduction in the number of all blood cell types:  red blood cell s,  white blood cell s, and platelets. Red blood cells may show abnormalities including  bizarre shapes , such as  teardrop-shaped cells , and  nucleated red blood cell  precursors may appear in the blood smear. (Normally, mature red blood cells in adults do not have a cell nucleus, and the presence of nucleated red blood cells suggests that immature cells are being released into the bloodstream in response to a very high demand for the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells.) Immature white cells are also seen in blood samples, and  basophil  counts are increased.\nThe formation of red blood cells is commonly known as  haematopoiesis . Up to the first 60 days of life, the yolk sac is the main source of haematopoiesis. The liver is then used as the main hematopoietic organ of the embryo until near birth, where it is then taken over by the bone marrow. Most red blood cells are released into the blood as reticulocytes. Polychromasia occurs when the immature reticulocytes of the bone marrow are released, resulting in a grayish blue color of the cells. This color is seen because of the ribosomes still left on the immature blood cells, which are not found on mature red blood cells. These cells still contain a nucleus as well due to the early release, which is not needed in mature blood cells because their only function is to carry oxygen in the blood. The life span of a typical red blood cell is acknowledged to be approximately 120 days and the time period of a reticulocyte found in the blood to be one day. The percentage of reticulocytes calculated to be in the blood at any given time indicates the rapidity of the red blood cell turnover in a healthy patient. The number of reticulocytes, however, reflects the amount of erythropoiesis that has occurred on any certain day. The absolute number of reticulocytes is referred to as the  reticulocyte index  and is calculated by adjusting the reticulocyte percentage by the ratio of observed hematocrit to expected hematocrit to get the 'corrected' reticulocyte count.\nWhat red blood cells do. Your body makes three types of blood cells \u00e2\u0080\u0094 white blood cells to fight infection, platelets to help your blood clot and red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body and to carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to your lungs so that it can be exhaled.\nThere are three main types of blood cells in the human body. These are the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The red blood cells are also known as erythrocytes, white blood cells as leukocytes, and platelets as thrombocytes.Red blood cells are the most common type of blood cell, making up about 45% of the blood cells.hese are the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.

The primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen to body cells and deliver carbon dioxide to the lungs.A red blood cell has what is known as a biconcave shape. Both sides of the cell's surface curve inward like the interior of a sphere.s more red blood cells enter blood circulation, oxygen levels in the blood and tissues increase. When the kidneys sense the increase in oxygen levels in the blood, they slow the release of erythropoietin. As a result, red blood cell production decreases. Red blood cells circulate on average for about 4 months.\nThe primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen to body cells and deliver carbon dioxide to the lungs.

The cytoplasm of erythrocytes is rich in hemoglobin, an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells.\nBlood is a specialized body fluid. It has four main components: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood has many different functions, including: 1  transporting oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and tissues.2  forming blood clots to prevent excess blood loss.lood appears red because of the large number of red blood cells, which get their color from the hemoglobin. The percentage of whole blood volume that is made up of red blood cells is called the hematocrit and is a common measure of red blood cell levels.\nRed blood cells are also known as RBCs, red cells, red blood corpuscles (an archaic term), haematids, erythroid cells or erythrocytes (from Greek erythros for red and kytos for hollow vessel, with-cyte translated as cell in modern usage).n humans, mature red blood cells are flexible and oval biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults.\nThe primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen to body cells and deliver carbon dioxide to the lungs.

Red blood cells are important for the transport of oxygen-rich blood to body tissues and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Red blood cells are red because they contain an iron-rich protein known as hemoglobin, which is bright red in color. Over time, red blood cells wear out and die.The bone marrow continually makes more red blood cells. Certain foods increase production of red blood cells.olic Acid-Rich Foods. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is a B-complex vitamin that helps the body make new healthy red blood cells. Patients with low levels of folic acid often develop anemia. Patients can increase red blood cells in the body by consuming foods rich in folic acid.\nRed blood cells: The blood cells that carry oxygen. Red cells contain hemoglobin and it is the hemoglobin which permits them to transport oxygen (and carbon dioxide). Hemoglobin, aside from being a transport molecule, is a pigment.It gives the cells their red color (and their name).The abbreviation for red blood cells is RBCs.Red blood cells are sometime simply called red cells.emoglobin, aside from being a transport molecule, is a pigment.

Red blood cell, also called erythrocyte, cellular component of blood, millions of which in the circulation of vertebrates give the blood its characteristic colour and carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. The mature human red blood cell is small, round, and biconcave; it appears dumbbell-shaped in profile.\nalso known as red blood cells (RBC) are mature red blood cells produced by the red bone marrow. The primary role of these cells is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The oxygen is transported by the hemoglobin.\n1. Both red blood cells and white blood cells are found in blood. 2. Both red blood cells and white blood cells can be carried by blood from one part to other part of our body \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 .3.The red blood cells and the White Blood Cells can are found in the circulatory system. 4.It both have cell membrane and cytoplasm.hite blood cells are part of the Immune System and help the body combat disease, viruses, etc. Red blood cells are part of the Circulatory System and carry things such as oxy \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 gen throughout the body.\nRed blood cells are an important element of blood. Their job is to transport oxygen to the body's tissues in exchange for carbon dioxide, which is carried to and eliminated by the lungs. Red blood cells are formed in the red bone marrow of bones. Stem cells in the red bone marrow called hemocytoblasts give rise to all of the formed elements in blood. If a hemocytoblast commits to becoming a cell called a proerythroblast, it will develop into a new red blood cell. The formation of a red blood cell from hemocytoblast takes about 2 days. The body makes about two million red blood cells every second. Blood is made up of both cellular and liquid components. If a sample of blood is spun in a centrifuge, the formed elements and fluid matrix of blood can be separated from each other. Blood consists of 45% red blood cells, less than 1% white blood cells and platelets, and 55% plasma.\nRed Blood Cells. The most common symptom of a low red blood cell count is fatigue (tiredness). A lack of hemoglobin in the blood causes fatigue. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells.It helps carry oxygen to the body. A low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath; dizziness, especially when standing up; headaches; coldness in your hands or feet; pale skin; and chest pain.If you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move the reduced amount of oxygen in your blood.hite Blood Cells. White blood cells help fight infections. Signs and symptoms of a low white blood cell count include fevers, frequent infections that can be severe, and flu-like illnesses that linger.\nRed Blood Cell. Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, contain the hemoglobin that carries oxygen and carbon dioxide around the body. (Erythro means red in Greek, and cyte translates to cell.) Hemoglobin gives red blood cells their Characteristic color.\nRed blood cells (also called erythrocytes) make up about 40% of the blood's volume. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that gives blood its red color and enables it to carry oxygen from the lungs and deliver it to all body tissues.hite blood cells (also called leukocytes) are fewer in number than red blood cells, with a ratio of about 1 white blood cell to every 600 to 700 red blood cells. White blood cells are responsible primarily for defending the body against infection. There are five main types of white blood cells.\nA red blood cell is sometimes simply referred to as a red cell. It is also called an erythrocyte or, rarely today, a red blood corpuscle. Red cells contain hemoglobin and it is the hemoglobin which permits them to transport oxygen (and carbon dioxide).\n2.
