on 3 November 2007 that the Air and Space Museum's collections committee, an advisory group on the acquisition and transfer of aircraft, had voted 5\u20134 on 28 September 2007 for deaccessioning The Swoose, and transfer it to the  National Museum of the United States Air Force  in Dayton, Ohio.

The Swoose has never been in a plan to be displayed, Dailey said. A recommended condition of this transfer was that the National Museum of the United States Air Force transfer ownership of a restored B-17 to the National Air and Space Museum's  Udvar V. Hazy  site for display, as that museum lacks a B-17. The matter was discussed by the governing board of the Dayton museum, and with the recent arrival of the B-17F  Memphis Belle  it was decided that continued display of the Museum's  B-17G Shoo Shoo Baby  would be unnecessary. Upon completion of the restoration and display of the Swoose, Shoo Shoo Baby will be transferred to the Washington D.C. museum for display (Memphis Belle is not expected to be completed until 2015). This decision raised some concerns among the staff and patrons of the Dayton museum, as \"Shoo Shoo Baby\" is one of the world's finest restored examples of a B-17G, and has been a popular exhibit at the museum for many years. It was eventually pointed out that with the display of the Swoose and eventual display of the Memphis Belle the National Museum of the United States Air Force will possess the world's two most historically significant B-17s, and another B-17G model can easily be obtained when funds and space become available.", "qas": [{"id": "question_499", "question": "How did the museum get acquired?", "answers": [{"text": "The Washington Post  reported on 3 November 2007 that the Air and Space Museum's collections committee, an advisory group on the acquisition and transfer of aircraft, had voted 5\u20134 on 28 September 2007 for deaccessioning The Swoose, and transfer it to the  National Museum of the United States Air Force  in Dayton, Ohio.", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_500", "question": "What else did Dailey do after the Swoose?", "answers": [{"text": "The panel forwarded its decision to Gen.
