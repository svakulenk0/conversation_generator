{"input_text": "In 1974, after retiring from the Air Force, Boyne joined the National Air and Space Museum as curator of air transport. Prior to the opening of the museum in 1976, he was assigned responsibility for introducing all aircraft into their exhibits. Boyne was also responsible for transforming the museum's dilapidated  Silver Hill  facility into the world's premier restoration facility. He also organized the effort to rename the facility in honor of  Paul E. Garber , a curator of the National Air Museum\u2014the predecessor to the National Air and Space Museum.\nThe spacecraft is on permanent display at the  National Air and Space Museum ,  Washington, D.C.\nThe National Air and Space Museum is a center for research into the history and science of  aviation  and  spaceflight , as well as  planet ary science and terrestrial  geology  and  geophysics . Almost all space and aircraft on display are originals or the original backup craft. It operates an annex, the  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center , at  Dulles International Airport , which opened in 2003 and itself encompasses . The museum currently conducts restoration of its collection at the  Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility  in  Suitland, Maryland , while steadily moving such restoration and archival activities into its Udvar-Hazy annex facilities .\nThe Air and Space museum  was originally called the National Air Museum when formed on August 12, 1946 by an act of  Congress  and signed into law by President  Harry S. Truman .  Some pieces in the National Air and Space Museum collection date back to the 1876  Centennial Exposition  in  Philadelphia  after which the Chinese Imperial Commission donated a group of kites to the Smithsonian after Smithsonian Secretary Spencer Fullerton Baird convinced exhibiters that shipping them home would be too costly. The  String fellow  steam engine intended for aircraft was added to the collection in 1889, the first piece actively acquired by the Smithsonian now in the current NASM collection.\nSeveral rovers were created for testing, training, or validation purposes. The engineering mockup is on display at the  Museum of Flight  in  Seattle, Washington . The Qualification Test Unit is on display at the  National Air and Space Museum  in  Washington, D.C.

On May 26, 1972 Boeing donated the 367-80 to the  Smithsonian Air and Space Museum , which had designated it one of the 12 most significant aircraft of all time. For the next 18 years the aircraft was stored at a  \"desert boneyard\"  now called the  309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group  (AMARG) at  Davis-Monthan Air Force Base  near  Tucson ,  Arizona  before being retrieved by Boeing in 1990 for restoration. The Dash 80's final flight was to  Dulles International Airport  near  Washington, D.C.  on August 27, 2003. Repainted to its original yellow and brown Boeing livery, it was put on display at the  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center , an annex of the  Smithsonian Institution 's  National Air and Space Museum , located adjacent to  Dulles Airport  in Chantilly, Virginia.\nIn the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the  National Air and Space Museum  (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center . The last survivor of its crew,  Theodore Van Kirk , died on July 28, 2014, at the age of 93.\nOut of the five fully functional shuttle orbiters built, three remain. Enterprise, which was used for atmospheric test flights but not for orbital flight, had many parts taken out for use on the other orbiters. It was later visually restored and was on display at the  National Air and Space Museum 's  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center  until April 19, 2012. Enterprise was moved to New York City in April 2012 to be displayed at the  Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum , whose Space Shuttle Pavilion opened on July 19, 2012.  Discovery replaced Enterprise at the  National Air and Space Museum 's  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center .

Located in the National Air and Space Museum's Mall location, the Dewitt Clinton Ramsey Room houses rare books, serials, oral histories, vertical files, and the Bella Landauer Collection of sheet music. Housed in the Smithsonian Institution Libraries\u2019 Research Annex in Landover, MD, the ALM Collection is a growing body of largely  grey literature  in the form of government manuals, reports, studies, and surveys capturing the history and evolution of civil aviation..\nIn the  United States ,  NASA , which led the US space agencies, responded to ISY with the completion or creation of many important space programs, including numerous collaborations with other domestic and international space agencies. A total of twelve programmes were launched, the most in any year up to that point. NASA focused particularly on projects \u2014 such as the  Mars Observer , which studied the atmosphere and climate of  Mars  \u2014 that examined the possibility of sustaining human life outside Earth, as well as those exploring problems that existed on Earth at the time. ISY was also recognized with the opening of a new exhibit, entitled \"Where Next, Columbus?\" at the  National Air and Space Museum .\nIn 1989, Air France signed a letter of agreement to donate a Concorde to the  National Air and Space Museum  in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, Air France honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is on display at the Smithsonian's  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy  Center at  Dulles Airport .\nFrom 1985 to 2003, Enterprise was stored at the  Smithsonian 's hangar at  Washington Dulles International Airport  before it was restored and moved to the Smithsonian's newly built  National Air and Space Museum   Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center  at Washington Dulles, where it was the centerpiece of the space collection. On April 12, 2011, NASA announced that , the most traveled orbiter in the fleet, would be added to the collection once the  Shuttle fleet was retired . On April 17, 2012, Discovery was transported by  Shuttle Carrier Aircraft  to Dulles from  Kennedy Space Center , where it made several passes over the Washington D.C. metro area.\nAfter N703NA was retired from test operations, it was donated to the Smithsonian  National Air and Space Museum  in Washington, D.C.  The XV-15 was flown cross-country from Fort Worth, Texas to the museum before being decommissioned for display.  It is now on display at the  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center  at  Washington Dulles International Airport .\nHe 219 A-2 Werknummer 290 202 is undergoing restoration in the collection of the  Smithsonian   National Air and Space Museum  in  Washington, D.C. ,  USA . The  fuselage  has been put on display at the  Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center  by Dulles Airport, however, the wings were not attached as of late August 2016. The wings had been stored at the  Paul Garber Facility  in Silver Hill, Maryland. The repainted wings were displayed during the January 30, 2016 open house in the restoration hangar paint shack. , the completely restored fuselage and tail surfaces, along with the aircraft's partially restored DB 603 engines and nacelles (possibly as Heinkel-designed specific,  Kraftei  unitized powerplant installations) displayed nearby, can be seen displayed near the museum's  Dornier Do 335  and  Arado Ar 234 , the only surviving examples of each aircraft existing in 21st century aviation museums anywhere, and which were aircraft that accompanied WkNr. 290 202 across the Atlantic over 60 years ago. By August 2014 the wing structure (without control surfaces fitted) had been essentially restored, and was ready for the trip to the NASM's Udvar-Hazy shops to join the fuselage and engine nacelles there, with replacement Hirschgeweih VHF-band radar antenna components to be fabricated, based on a preserved example located in Europe and loaned to the NASM for replication, as part of the ongoing restoration process.\nMary Feik retired from the  National Air and Space Museum \u2019s (NASM) Paul E.

The model was intended to give the viewing public a better understanding of the size, scale and complexity of the satellite, as well as pique the interest of viewers in science and astronomy in general. The model is significantly different from the telescope, as the model must withstand gravity and weather, so is constructed mainly of aluminum and steel measuring approximately  and weighs .\nThe National Air and Space Museum Film Archives, part of the Archives Division at the  National Air and Space Museum ,  Smithsonian Institution , holds over 20,000 films documenting the history of  aviation  and  space flight .\nThe museum claims to be \"the only aviation museum and research center situated at a major airport and the only facility with a primary emphasis on contributions of  civil aviation  to the history and development of  Southern California \". There are other museums at major airports, however, including the  Udvar-Hazy Center  of the  National Air and Space Museum  adjacent to  Washington Dulles Airport , the  Royal Thai Air Force Museum  at  Don Muang Airport , the  Suomen ilmailumuseo  ( Finnish Aviation Museum ) at  Helsinki-Vantaa Airport , the  Frontiers of Flight Museum  at  Dallas Love Field , the  Tulsa Air and Space Museum & Planetarium  at  Tulsa International Airport  and others.\nThe Washington Post  reported on 3 November 2007 that the Air and Space Museum's collections committee, an advisory group on the acquisition and transfer of aircraft, had voted 5\u20134 on 28 September 2007 for deaccessioning The Swoose, and transfer it to the  National Museum of the United States Air Force  in Dayton, Ohio. The panel forwarded its decision to Gen. John R. \"Jack\" Dailey, the museum director, and Donald S. Lopez Sr., the deputy director, who subsequently decided to stand by the committee's recommendation. \"There were good arguments on both sides,\" said Dailey, who had requested a collections review to alleviate a storage crunch at the aforementioned Paul Garber Restoration Facility, where The Swoose has been stored since 1961. The Swoose has never been in a plan to be displayed, Dailey said. A recommended condition of this transfer was that the National Museum of the United States Air Force transfer ownership of a restored B-17 to the National Air and Space Museum's  Udvar V. Hazy  site for display, as that museum lacks a B-17. The matter was discussed by the governing board of the Dayton museum, and with the recent arrival of the B-17F  Memphis Belle  it was decided that continued display of the Museum's  B-17G Shoo Shoo Baby  would be unnecessary. Upon completion of the restoration and display of the Swoose, Shoo Shoo Baby will be transferred to the Washington D.C. museum for display (Memphis Belle is not expected to be completed until 2015). This decision raised some concerns among the staff and patrons of the Dayton museum, as \"Shoo Shoo Baby\" is one of the world's finest restored examples of a B-17G, and has been a popular exhibit at the museum for many years. It was eventually pointed out that with the display of the Swoose and eventual display of the Memphis Belle the National Museum of the United States Air Force will possess the world's two most historically significant B-17s, and another B-17G model can easily be obtained when funds and space become available.\nThe National Air and Space Museum of the  Smithsonian Institution , also called the NASM, is a museum in  Washington, D.C. . It holds the largest collection of historic  aircraft  and  spacecraft  in the world.
