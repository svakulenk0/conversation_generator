{"input_text": "Bernhard Ebbinghaus, born 1961 in Stuttgart, studied sociology at the  University of Mannheim  (1981\u201388) and was a Fulbright student at the  New School for Social Research  in 1984/85. Following a year at the Institut Universitaire d'Etudes Europ\u00e9ennes in Geneva, he was a doctoral student at the  European University Institute  (EUI) in Florence, Italy (1989\u201392), where he wrote his Ph.D.thesis on Labour Unity in Union Diversity: Trade Unions and Social Cleavages in Western Europe, 1890-1989 (1993). Returning to Mannheim, Ebbinghaus taught sociology and coordinated an international research project on trade unions in Europe at the  Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES) . From 1997 until 2004, he was Senior Fellow at the  Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies  (MPIfG) in Cologne and completed his Habilitation thesis in sociology at the  University of Cologne  in 2003. He was John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellow at the Center for European Studies at  Harvard University  (1999/2000), Visiting Professor at the  University of Wisconsin  in Madison (Fall 2001), and Interim Professor at the  University of Jena , Germany (2003\u201304). Ebbinghaus has been Professor of Sociology (Chair of Macrosociology) at the  University of Mannheim  since 2004, where he was founding director of the Doctoral Center for the Social and Behavioral Studies of the Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS) (2006\u201309). Most recently, he was Director of the  Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)  (2008\u201311), one of the largest university-based social science research institutes in Germany.\nShack earned her Bachelor of Arts in Humanities from Miami-Dade's  Barry University  in 1970 with a major in English and a minor in Journalism/Communications. In 1975, she received a Master of Arts in Social Science with specialization in Urban Sociology from the  University of Colorado . She taught sociology and political science at  Florida International University .\nIn more recent times, Burawoy has moved away from observing factories to looking at his own place of work- the university- to consider the way sociology is taught to students and how it is put into the  public domain . His work on  public sociology  is most prominently shown in his presidential address to the American Sociological Association in 2004, where he divides sociology into four separate (yet overlapping) categories: public sociology,  policy sociology  (which has an extra-academic audience), professional sociology (which addresses an academic audience familiar with theoretical and methodological frameworks common to the discipline of sociology), and lastly  critical sociology  which, like public sociology, produces reflexive knowledge but which is only available to an academic audience, like professional sociology.\nWilson is Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor at  Harvard University . He is one of 24 University Professors, the highest professional distinction for a Harvard faculty member. After receiving a  Ph.D.  from  Washington State University  in 1966, Wilson taught  sociology  at the  University of Massachusetts Amherst , before joining the  University of Chicago  faculty in 1972. In 1990 he was appointed the Lucy Flower University Professor and director of the University of Chicago's Center for the Study of Urban Inequality. He joined the faculty at Harvard in July 1996.  He is affiliated with the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at the  John F. Kennedy School of Government ,  Harvard University 's Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, as well as Harvard's Department of Sociology. He is a member of the  Library of Congress  Scholars Council.\nMavis Biesanz graduated from Iowa State University in the summer of 1940, summa cum laude grade and  Phi Beta Kappa  honors. She financed her studies by waiting tables, scrubbing floors, babysitting, and washing dishes. On graduation, she married John Biesanz (b. 8/24/1913, Winona, MN), with whom she lived until John's death in 1995. John was a sociology and anthropology professor, who taught sociology during his career, including Tulane, Pittsburgh, and Wayne State University.Biesanz made a career as a writer. In addition, she has worked as an English teacher.  She wrote two widely used sociology textbooks with her husband,  and   Five others were written about Costa Rican and Paname\u00f1an sociology. They had two sons, Richard and Barry, and daughter, Katja.\nGradually, he shifted his main interests from philosophy to sociology, and from law to religion. In 1987 he presented a paper at the international conference of the  Mormon History Association  in  Oxford , where he started a long-lasting co-operation with Swiss historian  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mayer  and with the  Utah  lawyer and historian Michael W. Homer, which would eventually lead to the establishment of CESNUR in 1988. He taught short courses in the sociology of religious movements at the  Athenaeum Pontificium Regina Apostolorum  and in 2005\u20132006 at the  Pontifical University of the Holy Cross , both Vatican-accredited institutions. In 2012 he joined the faculty of the Pontifical Salesian University, also accredited by the Vatican, as a professor of Sociology of Religious Movements and, as of 2013, of Sociology of Religions. In the second edition of his Nuovo manuale di sociologia della religione (New Manual of Sociology of Religion)  Roberto Cipriani , former president of AIS (Associazione Italiana di Sociologia) and one of Italy's leading sociologists, calls Introvigne \"one of the Italian sociologists of religion most well-known abroad, and among the world's leading scholars of new religious movements\".\nHerbert Spencer  (1820\u20131903), the English philosopher, was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the  Darwinian revolution  in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before  Darwin  published anything on the subject. Encouraged by his friend and follower  Edward L. Youmans , Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term \"sociology\" in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal  International Monthly ,  Franklin H. Giddings  (1855\u20131931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that \"first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest\" in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States,  Charles Horton Cooley , stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology \"probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since.\" It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including  \u00c9mile Durkheim , defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim\u2019s  Division of Labour in Society  is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable  biologist , Spencer coined the term \" survival of the fittest \" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a  laissez-faire  style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the  United States  and  England . Although Spencer's work is rarely discussed in contemporary sociological theory, his work has been adapted and changed, and resurfaces in various contemporary forms.\nHe was born in Hongseong, South Korea and raised in Daejeon until high school. He graduated from  Korea University  with BA in sociology in August 1985. He received his Ph. D. from the  University of Chicago  and taught at the Asian American Studies Department of the  University of California, Santa Barbara  between 1992 and 1995 before he joined the Department of  Sociology  in  Korea University . He is now professor of the Department of Sociology, Korea University and the former presidents of the Association for North Korean Migrants Studies and the Association for the Studies of Koreans Abroad, and head of the Brain Korea 21 Project Group for Conflict Society. His research interests include  social psychology ,  minorities ,  international migration , and  multiculturalism .\nPossamai began his teaching career as a  tutor  at LaTrobe University (1995\u20131998), and then in 1999 received an appointment as  lecturer  in sociology at the University of Western Sydney. In addition to teaching introductory courses in Sociology, he has also taught courses in the  sociology of religion ,  sociology of migration ,  sociological theory ,  sociology of power and deviance , and the  philosophy  of  social sciences . Perles Noires, his first book of fiction, was listed as one of the favourite books by the public libraries in  Paris  in 2006. He has also recently published the science fiction novel Le XXIe si\u00e8cle de Dickerson et Ferra.\nMannheim's theory on the sociology of knowledge is based on some of the epistemological discoveries of  Immanuel Kant  and the sociology of knowledge is known as a section of the greater field known as the  sociology of culture . The sociology of culture is defined as the relationship between culture and society. The sociology of culture had two main branches: a moderate branch, represented by  Max Scheler , who believed that social conditions do not affect the content of knowledge, and a radical branch, of which Mannheim and Karl Marx were a part. The radical branch highlighted that society is determined by all aspects of culture. When it came to the sociology of knowledge, Mannheim believed that it established a dependence of knowledge on social reality. Mannheim's central question of the sociology of knowledge, which tried to understand the relationship between society and knowledge, demonstrated his endeavors to solve the issue of \"historical nature and unity of mind and life.\" Mannheim affirmed the sociology of knowledge as an \"extrinsic interpretation and sets apart from the immanent interpretation of thought products.\" The immanent interpretation is based on one's understanding of intellectual content, which is limited to theoretical content of knowledge and the extrinsic interpretation is based on the capability to understand manifestations. Knowing the difference between these two types of interpretations helped Mannheim create a place for the sociology of knowledge in the scientific system, thus leaving the sociology of knowledge to stand opposite of the traditional human sciences and to interpret knowledge through an exploration of social reality. Mannheim claimed that the sociology of knowledge has to be understood as the visionary expression of \"historical experience which has social reality at its vital center.\"\nThe Sociology Department comprises five teaching and research rooms: Sociological Theory, Sociological Method, Applied Sociology, Common Psychology and Applied Psychology. Other units include the Department Office, Information Room and the Student Office. The department draws support from its highly qualified and well-recognized faculty and staff.\nCalhoun was born in Watseka, Illinois in 1952. He studied anthropology and cinema at the  University of Southern California , (BA, 1972), anthropology and sociology at  Columbia University  (MA, 1974), and social anthropology at  Manchester University  (MA, (Econ.), 1975). He received his  doctorate  in  sociology  and modern social and economic history from  Oxford University  in 1980, a student of J.C. Mitchell,  Angus MacIntyre , and R.M. Hartwell. He taught at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  from 1977 to 1996.  There he was also Dean of the Graduate School and founding Director of the University Center for International Studies.  He moved to NYU in 1996 as Chair of the Department of Sociology in a period of major rebuilding.  He left for Columbia in 2006 but returned to NYU as Director of the Institute for Public Knowledge (IPK), which promotes collaborations among academics from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and between academics and working professionals. Since September 2012 he has been the Director and President of the  London School of Economics .  Calhoun has also taught at the  Beijing Foreign Studies University , the  Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales ,   University of Asmara ,  University of Khartoum ,  University of Oslo , and Oxford itself. He was Benjamin Meaker Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Bristol in 2000 and received an honorary doctorate from La Trobe University in Melbourne in 2005.\nHans Sebald (February 22, 1929 \u2013 February 2, 2002) was Professor of  Sociology  at  Arizona State University . Sebald taught courses in the sociology of youth and social psychology, but was perhaps best known for his work on  witchcraft . He was born in Serb,  Germany , but came to the  United States  in 1954 to attend  Manchester University  in  Indiana , from which he received a  bachelor's degree   cum laude  in 1958.  He earned a  master's degree  in 1959 and a  doctorate  degree in 1963 from  Ohio State University , and taught at  Arizona State University  from 1963 until 1992.  He became a  naturalized  U.S. citizen in 1968.\nIn 1967, S\u00f8rensen was the first recipient of a master's degree in  Sociology  from the  University of Copenhagen . He went on to  Johns Hopkins University  in  Baltimore  where he earned a Ph.D. in Social Relations in 1971. From 1971 to 1984, Professor S\u00f8rensen taught at the  University of Wisconsin , serving as department chair in Sociology from 1979 to 1982. He was appointed to the faculty at  Harvard University  in 1984. As chair of the Sociology Department from 1984 until 1992, he led a substantial renewal of its faculty and programs. From 1994 until his injury, he was chair of Harvard's Joint Doctoral Program in Organizational Behavior.\nA course entitled \"sociology\" was taught for the first time in the United States in 1875 by  William Graham Sumner , drawing upon the thought of Comte and  Herbert Spencer  rather than the work of Durkheim. In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the  University of Kansas , lectured by  Frank Blackmar . The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 and the first full-fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the  University of Chicago  by  Albion W. Small  (1854\u20131926), who in 1895 founded the  American Journal of Sociology . American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology.  George Herbert Mead  and  Charles H. Cooley  were influential in the development of  symbolic interactionism  and  social psychology  at the University of Chicago, while  Lester Ward  emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883.\nHe has also taught many Ph.Ds in Sociology specializing in Social Movements and Organizations. Notably, John Crist (Associate Director of Research at the Center for International and Regional Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar), Bob Edwards (Professor of Sociology at  East Carolina University ), Erik Johnson (Assistant Professor of Sociology at  Washington State University ), Andrew Martin (Associate Professor of Sociology at  Ohio State University ), Ron Pagnucco (Associate Professor of Sociology at  CSB/SJU ), Pat Rafail (Assistant Professor of Sociology at  Tulane University ), Deb Swanson (Professor of Sociology and Social Work at  Hope College ), and Ed Walker (Assistant Professor of Sociology at  UCLA ).\nIn  Malta , after teaching  Italian  and  sociology  in public elementary schools, Vella taught  political economy  and  social development  at the  University of Malta .\nThe field of medical sociology is usually taught as part of a wider  sociology ,  clinical psychology  or  health studies  degree course, or on dedicated master's degree courses where it is sometimes combined with the study of  medical ethics / bioethics . In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough report in 1944: \"In medicine, \u2018social explanations\u2019 of the etiology of disease meant for some doctors a redirection of medical thought from the purely clinical and psychological criteria of illness. The introduction of \u2018social\u2019 factors into medical explanation was most strongly evidenced in branches of medicine closely related to the community \u2014 Social Medicine and, later, General Practice\" .\nHarry Anastasiou is currently Professor and leading core faculty member of  Portland State University 's Conflict Resolution Graduate Program.

He did postdoctoral work at the Organizations Research Training Program in the Department of Sociology at  Stanford University  from 1981 to 1983 and taught in the Department of Sociology at  Princeton University  from 1983 to 1988.\nDewey believes that \u201cthe educational process has two sides.\u201d  Psychological and sociological impacts are two sides of the education process that go hand-in-hand; \u201cneither can be subordinated to the other or neglected without evil results following.\u201d  Psychology provides the foundation of education while sociology provides the scenario.  Unless what is taught and how we teach relates to students\u2019 lives, it can become stressful.  Even good grades are not indicative of authentic learning.  Students may become disenfranchised.  Psychology and social dynamics must exist in conjunction with each other to create a truly internal experience.It is important to know what is happening in the world-at-large, according to Dewey.  One must also look at the student's world to ensure success relevant to their own realm of accomplishment.  \u201cWe must also be able to project them into the future to see what their outcome and end will be.\u201d  Dewey holds that we must look into the individual future of every student and see what their own outlook is and how we can get there\u2014not a collective outlook defined by blanket societal expectations of success by every person. Dewey states, \u201cTo know what a power really is we must know what its end, use, or function is.\u201d  In sum, a student cannot achieve power over their future until they know what their future can be.  Teachers cannot prepare students for a future we cannot foretell as a result of ever-changing technology.  People can truly prepare for the future by empowering students.  In Dewey's words, \u201cTo prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself.\u201d  Hands-on learning that utilizes the senses and capacity of the student creates the most success, intrinsically and externally.  Dewey believes \u201cthat the individual who is to be educated as a social individual and that society is an organic union of individuals.\u201d  Demonstration of this success shows a psychological process.  Utilizing the skills derived from effective psychological learning, social factors can be successfully recognized and addressed.\nThe University of Chicago developed the major sociologists at the time. It brought them together, and even gave them a hub and a network to link all the leading sociologists. In 1925, a third of all sociology graduate students attended the University of Chicago. Chicago was very good at not isolating their students from other schools. They encouraged them to blend with other sociologists, and to not spend more time in the class room than studying the society around them.  This would teach them real life application of the classroom teachings. The first teachings at the University of Chicago were focused on the social problems that the world had been dealt. At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; especially not to the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to go into an entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individual\u2019s relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small was the head of the sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the American Journal of Sociology.  Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the program\u2019s methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend. The pair even wrote the sociology program\u2019s textbook for a reference and get all students on the same page more effectively. Many remarkable sociologists such as George Hebert Mead, W.E. Du Bois, Robert Park, Charles S. Johnson, William Ogburn, Hebert Blumer and many others have significant ties to the University of Chicago.\nGoldblatt taught sociology of sport at Bristol University and Pitzer College. He was initially a medical student but later studied for a sociology degree.\nFrom 1964, he taught  sociology of art  at the Sorbonne. He supported his doctoral thesis (sociology) in 1995 and was thereafter  habilited  to direct thesis.\nFlorian Witold Znaniecki (15 January 1882 \u2013 23 March 1958) was a Polish  philosopher  and  sociologist  who taught and wrote in  Poland  and in the  United States . Over the course of his work he shifted his focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology; the founder of Polish academic sociology, and of an entire  school of thought  in sociology. He won international renown as  co-author , with  William I. Thomas , of the study,  The Polish Peasant in Europe and America  (1918\u201320), which is considered the foundation of modern  empirical sociology . He also made major contributions to  sociological theory , introducing terms such as  humanistic coefficient  and  culturalism .\nSociologist have studied religion right from the beginning of the discipline, in the 19th century. It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as Comte, Karl Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can\u2019t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002).\nThe department has a coordinated programme of teaching and research covering a variety of fields, including some developed for the first time in the country. It grew into international prominence through the works of the notable sociologists and social anthropologists who have taught in the department, which include  M N Srinivas ,  J. P. S. Uberoi ,  Andre Beteille , and  Veena Das  among others. Studies have been published or prepared on community power structures, local-level politics, trade unions, co-operatives, textual and contextual studies of Hinduism, religious symbolism, family and kinship, and social and religious movements.  Studies have also been conducted in the fields of stratification, gender, environment, the sociology of development, historical sociology, urban sociology, and medical sociology. The sociology of masculinity, demography, popular culture, education, migration, the sociology of violence and documentary practices of the state are some of the new areas that faculty members are working on at present.  In 2010, Professor Nandini Sundar from the department, won the Infosys prize in the field of social anthropology.\nSome influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example  Eugen Ehrlich 's concept of \"living law\" and  Georges Gurvitch 's \"social law\"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and \"communities\", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.\nAfter returning to Prague he was able to take his  Abitur  (university entrance exams) and went on to study medicine at  Charles University  in Prague from 1946 to 1949. He received a  Jan Masaryk  scholarship but came into political conflict with the new  Communist regime  and was temporarily imprisoned. Steiner therefore left Prague and emigrated to  Australia , where he studied  German   Philology  and  Psychology  at  Melbourne University  and worked as an interpreter for, and adviser to, immigrants. He graduated in 1952 with a BA. A scholarship enabled him to travel to the USA in 1952, where he earned his MA in Sociology and German Philology at  Missouri University  in Columbia in 1955.

Though he taught sociology and social thought, he did not have a formal degree in those fields. His undergraduate degree, from the  University of Pennsylvania , was in  French literature . He came to the attention of  Louis Wirth , a distinguished sociologist at the University of Chicago, who hired Shils as a research assistant. Thereafter, Shils became recognized as an outstanding teacher in the field of sociology. His knowledge of the literatures of numerous cultures and fields was deemed to be impressive. He taught sociology,  social philosophy , English literature, history of  Chinese science  and other subjects.\nThe first college course entitled \"Sociology\" was taught in the United States at  Yale  in 1875 by  William Graham Sumner . In 1883  Lester F. Ward , the first president of the American Sociological Association, published Dynamic Sociology\u2014Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez-faire sociology of  Herbert Spencer  and Sumner. Ward's 1200 page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the  University of Kansas , lectured by  Frank W. Blackmar . The Department of Sociology at the  University of Chicago  was established in 1892 by  Albion Small , who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894.  George Herbert Mead  and  Charles Cooley , who had met at the  University of Michigan  in 1891 (along with  John Dewey ), would move to Chicago in 1894. Their influence gave rise to  social psychology  and the  symbolic interactionism  of the modern  Chicago School . The  American Journal of Sociology  was founded in 1895, followed by the  American Sociological Association  (ASA) in 1905. The sociological \"canon of classics\" with Durkheim and  Max Weber  at the top owes in part to  Talcott Parsons , who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences. Parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. Sociology in the United States was less historically influenced by  Marxism  than its European counterpart, and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach.\nHe has taught courses in sociological theory, sociology of religion, and the sociology of diaspora Jewry.\nWillard Walter Waller (1899\u20131945) was an American sociologist. Much of his research concerned the  sociology of the family ,  sociology of education  and the  sociology of the military . His The Sociology of Teaching (1932) was described as an \"early classic\" in the field of the sociology of education. Before his sudden death, he was recognized as one of the most prominent scholars in the field of sociology.\nIn 1895, he published  The Rules of Sociological Method , a  manifesto  stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the  University of Bordeaux . In 1898, he founded  L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique , the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published  Suicide , a  case study  that provided an example of what the sociological  monograph  might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of  quantitative methods in criminology  during his suicide case study.\nPeter Ludwig Berger (born March 17, 1929) is an Austrian-born American  sociologist  known for his work in the  sociology of knowledge , the  sociology of religion , study of  modernization , and theoretical contributions to  sociological theory . He is best known for his book, co-authored with  Thomas Luckmann ,  The Social Construction of Reality : A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge (New York, 1966), which is considered one of the most influential texts in the sociology of knowledge, and played a central role in the development of  social constructionism . The book was named by the  International Sociological Association  as the fifth most influential book written in the field of sociology during the 20th century. In addition to this book, some of the other books that Berger has written include:  Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective  (1963);  A Rumor of Angels: Modern Society and the Rediscovery of the Supernatural  (1969); and The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Social Theory of Religion (1967). Berger has spent most of his career teaching at  The New School for Social Research ,  Rutgers University , and  Boston University . Before retiring, Berger was at  Boston University  since 1981, and was the director of the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture.\nKarl Anthony Hack (born 19 July 1966) is a British historian and academic, who specialises in the history of  Southeast Asia , the  British Empire , and of  insurgency  and  counter-insurgency . Drawing on interviews with insurgents, his work has demonstrated the precise role of high-level  coercion  in winning post-war counter-insurgencies, and explored extreme violence and violence limitation. He has also carried out a wide range of public work, ranging across heritage, memory, the media and the courts. Since 2016, he has been the inaugural Head of the School of History, Religious Studies, Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology (HRSSC) at  The Open University . Prior to joining The Open University in 2006, he taught at the  National Institute of Education , at Singapore\u2019s  Nanyang Technological University , from 1995 to 2006.\nSociological practice is different from pure academic sociology in which sociologists work in an academic setting such as a university with a teaching and pure research orientation. Although there are some common origins, sociological practice is entirely distinct from  social work . An increasing number of universities are attempting to gear curricula toward practical sociology in this way. Clinical sociology courses give students the skills to be able to work effectively with clients, teach basic  counseling  skills, give knowledge that is useful for careers such as victims assisting and drug rehabilitation, and teach the student how to integrate sociological knowledge with other fields they may go into such as marriage and family therapy, and clinical social work.\nIn 1964 Denitch moved to Yugoslavia for five years, where he did field research for several sociological projects on unions and on students for  Seymour Martin Lipset  of the  University of California at Berkeley .  In 1968 Denitch secured a major research position for a study of elites in Yugoslavia, through the  Bureau of Applied Social Research  at  Columbia University . He moved back to New York in 1969 to complete work on an MA in sociology at Columbia, awarded in 1970 (the university waived its requirement of a BA degree, which Denitch had never completed).  He received a doctorat d'universit\u00e9 from  University of Paris  in 1972 for research on the new working class with  Serge Mallet and  Lucien Goldman .  He completed his PhD in sociology in 1973 at Columbia with his dissertation on Yugoslavian elites.  He taught at  Yale University  in 1972, and moved in 1973 to  Queens College  of CUNY, where he remained until his retirement in 1994.  He was executive officer of the PhD Program in Sociology at  CUNY Graduate School  from 1976 through 1988.  He also taught during sabbatical leaves at Birbeck College,  University of London  in 1979, at the  University of Paris  in  Saint Denis  in 1982, at  Johns Hopkins University  in  Bologna  in 1980, and at the  University of Zagreb  in 1973, 1977, and 1988. He was also a visiting research professor at  UNAM  in  Mexico City  in 1986, 1988 and 1990.\nSome of the academic history that Cooley had is the instructor in Sociology from 1922\u20131926, assistant professor of Sociology from 1926\u20131930, associate professor from 1930\u20131935, professor, 1935 chairman of the department of Sociology from 1940\u20131952, acting director social science department from 1949\u20131950, co-director of the center for research on conflict resolution from 1961\u20131965, and the director of the college honors program from 1957-1961 all at the University of Michigan. The courses that he taught at the University of Michigan included \u201cStructure of American Society\u201d, \u201cProseminar in Sociological Research\u201d, \u201cSeminar in Social Integration\u201d, \u201cConcepts of Sociology\u201d. During Angell\u2019s years while working on his Ph.D, he became a faculty member at the University of Michigan. He was an instructor in Sociology in 1922 and also at that time, worked as Assistant to the Dean of Students. He learned many great tools and knowledge of leadership in that role and helped him become more important in the University for the future. During this time, Angell was a member of the Faculty due to earning the rank of Assistant Professor in 1926. So after a couple years of hard work with his Ph.D and working at the University he became a full-time faculty member. In 1930 he was awarded the position of Associate Professor and by 1935, Angell became a Professor at the University of Michigan and taught many students Sociology throughout his time. During these long years as working his way to being a Professor, Angell served as a member of multiple University committees. Some of these committees included, the Publications Board and the Athletic Board. These positions earned his experience and knowledge that helped him throughout his years as a professor. His love for sports was used while being apart of the Athletic Board where he made many decisions that has helped the Athletic programs During the times between Associate Professor and Professor, Angell conducted research in family law at Columbia but took most of his leaves of absence to go international and observe foreign systems in operation. This took place in the years of 1928-1929 and due to the abundance of travel that was taken place in Angell\u2019s life; people respected his knowledge for not just national work but all around the world. One of his major trips was to Germany where he spent three months doing research and observing during anti-Semitic riots and after the Munich Pact. This experience helped Angell return home to the U.S. determined to prevent anything like what happened in Germany to the United States. One of the major roles that Angell had at his time at the University of Michigan was the President of the Ann Arbor co-operative Society. He had a huge belief is finding solutions for many of the ills of modern society. His passion for this allowed him to learn so much about so many different ills and help many people out with their troubles.\nFamily, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A family is a group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an  institution  and unit of  socialization , with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the  nuclear family  and its distinct  gender roles . The notion of \" childhood \" is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula.  Feminist sociology , on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of  feminist theory  is the  patriarchy  and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure.  Feminist sociology  also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities. \"How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods\" is also a concern.  Social psychology  of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.\nColeman achieved renown with two studies on problem solving: An Introduction to Mathematical Sociology (1964) and Mathematics of Collective Action (1973). He taught at  Stanford University  and the  University of Chicago . In 1959, he moved to  Johns Hopkins University , where he taught as an associate professor. He eventually became a full professor in social relations until 1973, when he returned to Chicago.\nAli Oumlil (; born December 25, 1940) is a prominent Arab philosopher, thinker, human rights activist, diplomat and political persona. A primary figure in the field of Islamic historical methodology and Arab political thought, he is considered to be a pioneer in issues related to state formation in the Arab world. Oumlil has extensively studied the relationship between intellectual authority and political power, the sociological pluralism and its ideological interpretations as well as the reformist trends in Arab contemporary thought. Oumlil wrote 11 books, 3 of which were translated from Arabic to French. His writings are taught throughout the major universities of the MENA region and around the world, specifically in curriculums that specialize in Arab philosophy. Oumlil is considered to be a leading figure and one of the founders of modern Arab political thought.\nFollowing the 1908 revolution, sociological thinkers attempted to discern the foundations of  Europeanization  so as to graft Western social organization onto Ottoman institutions and Turkish culture. The sociologists of the time were heavily influenced by European, mainly French, sociologists. During and after the events leading to the  Turkish War of Independence  (1919-1923), the purported father of Turkish sociology,  Ziya G\u00f6kalp , argued for a break from Ottoman and Western ideologies. Instead he contended that  Pan-Turkism  was the appropriate basis of the new nation-state, which influenced the  Kemalist  foundation of modern Turkey. This connection between sociology and the development of the nation-state continues to be a strong theme in contemporary sociological thought in Turkey. Sociology in Turkey was again influenced heavily by the influx of German thinkers during the  Second World War  and later by American sociology. Today, Turkish sociology is taught as the study of social problems using scientific research methods.\nAsoka Bandarage began her teaching career at  Brandeis University , where she taught from 1979-1985.

His thesis was: \"Sociological Concepts in R. Kook's Teachings\".\nSociology in Turkey has went through several stages of development beginning with proto-sociologies in the 16th and 17th century. In the mid 19th century, sociology was taught within philosophy departments, and it uncritically adopted Western social theories and neglected research. In reaction to the rise of Western liberalism among several intellectuals, the Sultan  Abdul-Hamid II  suspended the constitution and forced liberal thinkers into voluntary or involuntary exile. The resulting division between Western liberalism and Pan-Islamism ultimately resulted in the  Young Turk Revolution  of 1908, with the latter the victors.\nAbstract: Sociology Alavi is a kind of sociology of religion; the sociology of religion and religion sociology are different. Sociology of religion means that it gets its principles from God's law and religious books and in accordance, it can be stated School of sociology and the sociology of religion and axioms are not provable in any school and these are the obvious tenet that we are accept them as a right tenet from some books such a Quran, Gospel or Avesta. Some people thought that sociology of religion does not mean because in sociology the main issue is the only study and they say we can not have Islamic physic so sociology of religion is not acceptable. The human form the society and its important for human to notice the structure of society and it recognize the truth and false of component and the relationship between them. So they try to find a model that they can convert the unhealthy society to healthy society. In the sociology of religion an ideal society is interpreted based on religious precepts.\nBetween 1976 and 1991 he taught sociology, social theory and philosophy at the University of Warsaw. From 1991-1992 he was a professor at the University of Kassel. In 1992 he settled in Germany. In 1995 he was appointed professor at the  University of Bremen . In the years 2001-2011 he was also an associate professor at the Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski University in Warsaw. He also taught, among others, at the Catholic University of America, Columbia University. He also gave visiting lectures at numerous universities e.g. Princeton University, University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. He is also an associate professor at the Akademia Ignatianum in Cracow.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social theory became most closely related to academic  sociology  while other related studies such as  anthropology ,  philosophy , and  social work  branched out into their own disciplines. Such subjects as \" philosophy of history \" and other such multi-disciplinary subject matter became part of social theory as taught under sociology.\nSociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as  criminology . The institutions of  social construction ,  social norms , dispute processing and  legal culture  are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called  law and society  studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders,  Eugen Ehrlich , who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts. Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.\nFive years after his arrival as a professor at the University of a Chicago in 1921, Ernest Burgess would publish one of his most celebrated works. He collaborated with sociologist Robert Park to write a textbook called Introduction to the Science of Sociology (Park & Burgess, 1921). This was one of the most influential sociology texts ever written. Many people at the time referred to this book as the \u201cBible of Sociology\u201d. This book represented the observation and reflection of men who have seen life from very different points of view. The book discussed many topics such as the history of sociology, human nature, investigating problems, social interaction, competition, conflicts, assimilation and more. Introduction to the Science of Sociology was so well organized and comprehensive that most graduate students taught by University of Chicago alumni were required to read it. This book was so informative that it was still being used decades after the death of Ernest Burgess.\nIn social studies, a general understanding of the government and current events are discussed. Students are expected to know the current president and vice president, and some important presidents such as Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. The concept of the law is taught in second grade. Second grade students may also get a basic understanding of history, and what life was like in times before they were born. Field trips to historical and science museums are common. Some basic sociological institutions are taught such as race and gender, and the exploration of different cultural groups such as Black, Latin, and Asian.  International geography is introduced while students learn about the continents, oceans, and basic countries such as China, India, France, Mexico, Canada, Australia, and the UK.\nRajani Kannepalli Kanth is a professor, economist, philosopher, and  social thinker.

During his career, he taught and published in several different fields of sociology and social problems, but his work in the sociology of religion was ultimately the most visible. He has enjoyed invitations as a visiting professor to several universities in California, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In 2004, he was invited as a visiting scholar to the School of Religion at the  Claremont Graduate University  in California, where he taught courses on the history and sociology of the Mormons and helped to develop the Council for the Study of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  and the  Howard W. Hunter Chair in Mormon Studies , first occupied by  Richard L. Bushman .\nIllustrate your answer with examples from sociological research and from your own experience.

In the words of C. Wright Mills, sociology looks for the public issues that underlie private troubles..Sociology differs from popular notions of human behavior in that it uses systematic, scientific methods of investigation and questions many of the common sense and taken-for-granted views of our social world.n the words of C.

Sociology differs from popular notions of human behavior in that it uses systematic, scientific methods of investigation and questions many of the common sense and taken-for-granted views of our social world.\nThe Other Social Sciences. Not all universities approach sociology the same way, and the new science evolved differently depending on where it was taught and who was teaching it. The two major types of sociology that emerged were qualitative sociology and quantitative sociology. Today, most universities use both qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry, and one method is not necessarily better than the other.\nSociology of Cities and Suburbs.
