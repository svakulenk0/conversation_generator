{"input_text": "P. van Lange, a  social psychologist  at the  Vrije Universiteit   Amsterdam  pointed out the similarity to the  Stanford Prison Experiment  (1971). In that experiment the participants were placed in a jail, where half played guards and the other half prisoners. In six days the experiment derailed. The guards became  aggressive ,  repressive  and  sadistic . They transformed into personalities outside their normal selves. \"From the Stanford-experiment may be concluded that human behavior is largely summoned by the local circumstances\", added his colleague J. van der Pligt, professor at the  Universiteit van Amsterdam .\"People get carried away,\" said A. Bergsma of Psychologie Magazine. \"Isolation becomes reality. They lose themselves in the experiment. There are no checks and balances. If there is no correction, they will derail one after another.\"  All experts agreed that the big reward for the winner increased the chance of accidents. But not all had a negative opinion. A. Lange, a professor of clinical psychology at the Universiteit van Amsterdam indicated that the program could produce certain insights not possible to achieve any more in socio-psychological research because the psychological well-being of the participant had been given greater importance. \"The  design  of the programme is the  wet dream  of a psychological researcher. Nowhere in the world an ethical commission will be found that would agree to such a design\", agreed psycho-physiologist A. Gaillard of the  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research .\nHumans have been shown to be obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate  authority  figures, as shown by the  Milgram experiment  in the 1960s, which was carried out by Stanley Milgram to find out how the  Nazis  managed to get ordinary people to take part in the mass murders of the  Holocaust . The experiment showed that obedience to authority was the norm, not the exception. Regarding obedience, Milgram said that \"Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to; Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others.\" A similar conclusion was reached in the  Stanford prison experiment .\nNow a more widely recognized study since the publication of his book, The Lucifer Effect, the  Stanford Prison Experiment  is infamous for its blatant display of  aggression  in deindividuated situations. Zimbardo created a mock prison environment in the basement of  Stanford University \u2019s psychology building in which he  randomly assigned  24 men to undertake the role of either guard or prisoner. These men were specifically chosen because they had no abnormal personality traits (e.g.:  narcissistic ,  authoritarian ,  antisocial , etc.) The experiment, originally planned to span over two weeks, ended after only six days because of the sadistic treatment of the prisoners by the guards. Zimbardo attributed this behavior to deindividuation due to immersion within the group and creation of a strong  group dynamic . Several elements added to the deindividuation of both guards and prisoners. Prisoners were made to dress alike, wearing stocking caps and hospital dressing gowns, and also were identified only by a number assigned to them rather than by their name. Guards were also given uniforms and reflective glasses which hid their faces. The dress of guards and prisoners led to a type of  anonymity  on both sides because the individual identifying characteristics of the men were taken out of the equation. Additionally, the guards had the added element of  diffusion of responsibility  which gave them the opportunity to remove personal responsibility and place it on a higher power. Several guards commented that they all believed that someone else would have stopped them if they were truly crossing the line, so they continued with their behavior. Zimbardo's prison study would have not been stopped if one of Zimbardo's graduate students, Christina Maslach, had not pointed it out to him.\nPerhaps most damning to the traditional view of character are the results of the experiments conducted by  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s and  Philip G. Zimbardo  in 1971. In the first of these experiments, the great majority of subjects, when politely though firmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what they thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming \"victim.\" In the second, the infamous  Stanford prison experiment , the planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life had to be ended after only six days because the college students who were assigned to act as guards became sadistic and those who were the \"prisoners\" became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. These and other experiments are taken to show that if humans do have noble tendencies, they are narrow, \"local\" traits that are not unified with other traits into a wider behavioral pattern of being.\nThe genesis of the programme was the 1971  Stanford prison experiment  carried out by  Philip Zimbardo  at  Stanford University , in which a group of students were recruited to perform the roles of 'prisoner' and 'guard' as a psychological experiment to test how human beings conform to roles. That study was brought to a premature end as a result of the extreme brutality displayed by guards towards prisoners.\nIn  The Journal of the American Medical Association ,  Zimbardo's situational perspective received support from other social situational experiments that demonstrated the same idea and concept. Almost ten years prior to the Stanford Prison Experiment (1971),  Stanley Milgram  conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had \"teachers\" that delivered mock electric shocks to the \"learner\" for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20\u201350 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a \"confederate\" that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, \"I advise you to continue with this experiment\" or \"I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks\" and the one that caught most teachers was \"You must continue with the shocks.\" Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.\nStanford University  psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  conducts a  psychological experiment  to test the hypothesis that the personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior between them. In the experiment, Zimbardo selects fifteen male students to participate in a 14-day prison simulation to take roles as prisoners or guards. They receive $15 per day. The experiment is conducted in a mock prison located in the basement of Jordan Hall, the university's psychology department building. The students who are guards become abusive, as does Zimbardo himself. Two students who play the role of prisoners quit the experiment early, and Zimbardo abruptly stops the entire experiment after only six days.\nIn the summer of 1971 a Stanford psychology professor,  Philip Zimbardo , conducted a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard which is known as the  Stanford prison experiment . The experiment, which was funded by the  Office of Naval Research , surprised the professor by the authoritarian and brutal reaction of the \"guards\" and the passive acceptance of abuse by the \"prisoners\". The experiment was criticized as unethical and was a partial cause of the development of ethical guidelines for experiments involving human subjects.\nIn 1971,  Stanford University   psychologist   Philip Zimbardo  conducted the  Stanford prison experiment  in which twenty-four male students were randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. The participants adapted to their roles beyond Zimbardo's expectations with prison guards exhibiting  authoritarian  status and psychologically abusing the prisoners who were passive in their acceptance of the abuse. The experiment was largely controversial with criticisms aimed toward the lack of scientific principles and a control group, and for ethical concerns regarding Zimbardo's lack of intervention in the prisoner abuse.\nForty years ago today, the Stanford Prison Experiment began \u00e2\u0080\u0094 arguably history\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most notorious and controversial psychology experiment, which gleaned powerful and unsettling insights into human nature.\nA study of prisoners and guards in a simulated prison.

The lesson that I learnt is Power tends to corrupt.
