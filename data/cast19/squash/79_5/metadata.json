{"input_text": "According to one historian, the book became a kind of \"substitute bible for  secularist s\" in which Reade attempts to trace the development of Western civilisation in terms analogous to those used in the natural sciences. He uses it to advance the philosophy of political liberalism and  social Darwinism . The final section of the book provoked enormous controversy due to Reade's \"outspoken attack on Christian dogma\" and the book was condemned by several magazines. In 1872  William Gladstone , the British Prime Minister, denounced The Martyrdom of Man as one of several \"irreligious works\" (the others included work by  Auguste Comte ,  Herbert Spencer , and  David Friedrich Strauss ).\nThe early sociology of  Herbert Spencer  came about broadly as a reaction to Comte.  Writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms (although Spencer was a proponent of  Lamarckism  rather than Darwinism).\nHerbert Spencer  (1820\u20131903), the English philosopher, was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the  Darwinian revolution  in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before  Darwin  published anything on the subject. Encouraged by his friend and follower  Edward L. Youmans , Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term \"sociology\" in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal  International Monthly ,  Franklin H. Giddings  (1855\u20131931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that \"first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest\" in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States,  Charles Horton Cooley , stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology \"probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since.\" It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including  \u00c9mile Durkheim , defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim\u2019s  Division of Labour in Society  is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable  biologist , Spencer coined the term \" survival of the fittest \" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a  laissez-faire  style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the  United States  and  England . Although Spencer's work is rarely discussed in contemporary sociological theory, his work has been adapted and changed, and resurfaces in various contemporary forms.\nThe early sociology of  Herbert Spencer  came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms.\nEarly sociocultural evolution theoriesthe theories of  Auguste Comte ,  Herbert Spencer  and  Lewis Henry Morgan developed simultaneously with, but independently of,  Charles Darwin 's works and were popular from the late 19th century to the end of  World War I . These 19th-century  unilineal evolution  theories claimed that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more civilized over time, and equated the culture and technology of  Western civilization  with progress. Some forms of early sociocultural evolution theories (mainly unilineal ones) have led to much criticised theories like  social Darwinism  and  scientific racism , used in the past to justify existing policies of  colonialism  and  slavery  and to justify new policies such as  eugenics .\nClassical social evolutionism is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte and of Herbert Spencer (coiner of the phrase \" survival of the fittest \"). In many ways, Spencer's theory of \" cosmic evolution \" has much more in common with the works of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of Charles Darwin. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as social evolutionism. Although he wrote that societies over time progressedand that progress was accomplished through competitionhe stressed that the individual rather than the  collectivity  is the  unit of analysis  that evolves; that, in other words, evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon. Nonetheless, the publication of Darwin's works proved a boon to the proponents of sociocultural evolution, who saw the ideas of biological evolution as an attractive explanation for many questions about the development of society.\nA course entitled \"sociology\" was taught for the first time in the United States in 1875 by  William Graham Sumner , drawing upon the thought of Comte and  Herbert Spencer  rather than the work of Durkheim. In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the  University of Kansas , lectured by  Frank Blackmar . The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 and the first full-fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the  University of Chicago  by  Albion W. Small  (1854\u20131926), who in 1895 founded the  American Journal of Sociology . American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology.  George Herbert Mead  and  Charles H. Cooley  were influential in the development of  symbolic interactionism  and  social psychology  at the University of Chicago, while  Lester Ward  emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883.\nIn the 1870-1930 period, the philosophy of  positivism  or \"cientificismo\" associated with  Auguste Comte  in France and  Herbert Spencer  in England exerted a strong influence on intellectuals, experts and writers in most of the region.\nA broad historical paradigm in both sociology and  anthropology , functionalism addresses the  social structure , referred to as  social organization  in among the classical theorists, as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by  Herbert Spencer ) is to regard  norm s and  institution s as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as  Marcel Mauss ,  Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski  and  Radcliffe-Brown . It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of  social evolutionism , in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As  Giddens  states: \"Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects).\"\nJohn Stuart Mill ,  Auguste Comte , and  Herbert Spencer  appear among the influences on the English historical economists. The second half of  Queen Victoria's  reign saw the triumph of  evolutionary  concepts in the  sciences   ( geology ,  biology , and  sociology ) and a transition from a \" coal  and  iron \" based  manufacturing  economy to one based on  communication ,  urbanization ,  finance , and  empire .  The rise of  the historical school of jurisprudence  provided  \"allies in the struggle against the dominance of the abstract theory.\" Historical economists viewed  classical  and  neoclassical economics  as too formal and as a rationalization of free-trade policies in a  colonial  and  imperial  setting.\nA precocious student, Durkheim entered the  \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure  (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as  Jean Jaur\u00e8s  and  Henri Bergson , would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of  Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges , a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin  dissertation  on  Montesquieu . At the same time, he read  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no  social science  curriculum at the time. Durkheim found  humanistic studies  uninteresting, turning his attention from  psychology  and  philosophy  to  ethics  and eventually,  sociology . He obtained his  agr\u00e9gation  in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.\nRatzenhofer understood sociology based on Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin and Auguste Comte as part of a comprehensive philosophy, which he described as \"positive monism\". He represented an evolutionary model of social development.\nKne\u017eevi\u0107 acknowledges his indebtness to  Auguste Comte  and  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  as well as  Karl Marx ,  Charles Darwin , and  Herbert Spencer .\nSpencer's interest in psychology derived from a more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality of natural law. In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed with the idea of demonstrating that it was possible to show that everything in the universe \u2013 including human culture, language, and morality \u2013 could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte's Syst\u00e8me de Philosophie Positive had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it was possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution.\nThe term \"classical social evolutionism\" is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer (who coined the phrase \" survival of the fittest \") and  William Graham Sumner . In many ways Spencer's theory of ' cosmic evolution ' has much more in common with the works of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of  Charles Darwin . Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the  individual  (rather than the  collectivity ) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon.\nHe was born in  Palermo  ( Italy ), and graduated from the  University of Buenos Aires  School of Medicine in 1900. Ingenieros was philosophically influenced by  Herbert Spencer  and  Auguste Comte , and wrote a very important philosophical and social work, \"El hombre mediocre\" (The Mediocre Man), in 1913. Ingenieros founded the  Buenos Aires  Institute of  Criminology  in 1907 and the Argentine Psychological Society in 1908; he was elected President of the Argentine Medical Association in 1909.\nSpencer helped popularize the word sociology in England, and compiled vast data aiming to build general theory through empirical analysis.  Spencer's 1850 book Social Statics shows Comtean as well as Victorian concern for social order.  Yet whereas Comte's social science was social physics, Spencer would take biology\u2014via Darwinism, so called, which arrived in 1859\u2014as the model of science.  Spencer's functionalist-evolutionary account identified social structures as functions that adapt, thus explaining social change.\nConvinced that human actions are guided by eternal laws, Le Bon attempted to synthesise  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer  with  Jules Michelet  and  Alexis de Tocqueville .\nSpencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; it was in this sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature applied without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation. The first objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held that it was possible to discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's Constitution of Man.\nThe  Positivist  philosophy that took form in Poland after the  January 1863 Uprising  was hardly identical with the philosophy of  Auguste Comte .  It was in fact a return to the line of  Jan \u015aniadecki  and  Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj \u2014a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period\u2014now enriched with the ideas of Comte.  However, it belonged only partly to  philosophy .  It combined Comte's ideas with those of  John Stuart Mill  and  Herbert Spencer , for it was interested in what was common to them all:  a sober,  empirical  attitude to life.\nIn many ways, Spencer's theory of cosmic evolution has much more in common with the works of  Lamarck  and  Auguste Comte 's  positivism  than with Darwin's.\nA broad historical paradigm in both sociology and  anthropology , functionalism addresses the  social structure  as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements.

He was the second  president of American Sociological Association  serving from 1908 to 1909. and succeeding his longtime ideological opponent  Lester F. Ward .\nPolish \"Positivism\" drew its name from the philosophy of  Auguste Comte . Much of its ideology was inspired by the works of British scholars and scientists including  Herbert Spencer  and  John Stuart Mill . The Polish Positivists advocated the exercise of reason before emotion.  They believed that independence, if it is to be regained, must be won gradually, by \"building from the foundations\" (creating a material infrastructure and educating the public) and through  organic work  that would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated social organism (a concept borrowed from  Herbert Spencer ).\nInfluenced by the  utopian socialist   Henri Saint-Simon , Comte developed the positive philosophy in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the  French Revolution , calling for a new social doctrine based on the  sciences . Comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as  Karl Marx ,  John Stuart Mill , and  George Eliot . His concept of sociologie and   social evolutionism  set the tone for early  social theorist s and  anthropologist s such as  Harriet Martineau  and  Herbert Spencer , evolving into modern academic sociology presented by  \u00c9mile Durkheim  as practical and objective  social research .\nSpencer read with excitement the original  positivist  sociology of  Auguste Comte . A  philosopher of science , Comte had proposed a theory of  sociocultural evolution  that society progresses by a general  law of three stages . Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Given the primacy with which Spencer placed on evolution in his work, Spencer's sociology might be described as  socially Darwinistic  (though strictly speaking he was a proponent of  Lamarckism  rather than Darwinism).  Despite the popularity of this view, such a description of Spencer's sociology is mistaken.  While Spencer's political and ethical writings had themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are not present in Spencer's sociological works, which focus on building a theory regarding how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing amounts of complexity amongst the various forms of social organization\nFollowing Ward as president of the American Sociological Association was  William Graham Sumner  from 1908 to 1909. He also held the first professorship of sociology at  Yale College , and in 1876, Sumner became the first to teach a course entitled \"sociology\" in the English-speaking world. His course focused predominantly on the work of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . He was ideologically opposed to the sociology of Ward as he felt that society could not be steered by scientific intervention, and famously stated the alternative to \"survival of the fittest\" was the \"survival of the unfittest.\" However, he also opposed the grand theorizing of Spencer. During the  Progressive Era  in the United States, social Darwinism became a contentious topic and Sumner and his course at  Yale College  was criticized for including Spencerian ideas. This almost led to Sumner's expulsion from teaching. His most famous sociological works are What Social Classes Owe to Each Other in 1883 and Folkways: a study of the sociological importance of usages, manners, customs, mores, and morals in 1906.\nDilthey was also interested in what some would call  sociology  in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . He objected to their  dialectic al/ evolution ist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, as well as their narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of  positivism  was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good things to say about the  neo-Kantian  sociology of  Georg Simmel , with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of  Max Weber , the primary founder of sociological  antipositivism . J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of  nonpositivist verstehende sociology  and the  Verstehen  method.\nAccording to Comte, scientific method constrains itself to observations, but frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws\u2014positive statements\u2014irrefutable by theology or by metaphysics, and laid as  foundation for subsequent knowledge .  Later, concluding science insufficient for society, Comte launched  Religion of Humanity , whose churches, honoring eminent scientists, led worship of humankind.  Comte coined the term  altruism , and emphasized  science's application  for humankind's social welfare, which would be revealed by Comte's spearheaded science, sociology.  Comte's influence is prominent in  Herbert Spencer  of England and  \u00c9mile Durkheim  of France establishing modern empirical and functionalist sociology.  Influential in the latter 19th century, positivism was often linked to evolutionary theory, yet was eclipsed in the 20th century by  neopositivism : logical positivism and logical empiricism.\nThe concept of social progress was introduced in the early 19th century  social theories , especially  social evolution  as described by  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . It was present in the  Enlightenment 's  philosophies of history . As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.\nIts publisher,  John Chapman , introduced Spencer to his salon which was attended by many of the leading radical and progressive thinkers of the capital, including  John Stuart Mill ,  Harriet Martineau ,  George Henry Lewes  and Mary Ann Evans ( George Eliot ), with whom he was briefly romantically linked. Spencer himself introduced the biologist  Thomas Henry Huxley , who would later win fame as 'Darwin's Bulldog' and who remained his lifelong friend. However it was the friendship of Evans and Lewes that acquainted him with John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic and with  Auguste Comte 's  positivism  and which set him on the road to his life's work. He strongly disagreed with Comte.\nSociology emerged as a separate discipline in the mid 1800's in western europe, during the onset of the industrial revolution. idustrialization affected all aspects of human existence-- where people lived, the nature of their work, their relationships, and how they viewed life. early sociologists who focused on these social changes included Auguste, Comte, Herbert Spencer, Carl Marks, Emile Durkheim, Max Webber, Harriet, Martineau, W.E.B. Du Bois. page 5-8\nthe social sciences, sociology emerged in Western Europe as a distinct discipline in the mid-1800s. Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber were early thinkers in the development of sociology. The idea of applying the scientific method to the social world, known as positivism, was first proposed by Auguste Comte. Based on this innovation and Comte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to apply the scientific method to social life, he is credited as being the founder of sociology.\nThe work of such classical sociological theorists as Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, and Vilfredo Pareto was important in its time and played a central role in the subsequent development of sociology.he work of such classical sociological theorists as Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, and Vilfredo Pareto was important in its time and played a central role in the subsequent development of sociology.\nDurkheim (1858-1917) who devoted himself to the scientific study of sociology is widely regarded as a pioneer in French sociology. It is known that Emile Durkheim inherits some of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer's ideas and developed a systematic sociology both in theory and methodology (Mo&ntilde;ivas, 2007, p. 18).\nWho coined the term sociology to describe the study of society?
