The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the  Darwinian revolution  in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before  Darwin  published anything on the subject. Encouraged by his friend and follower  Edward L. Youmans, Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term \"sociology\" in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal  International Monthly,  Franklin H. Giddings  (1855\u20131931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that \"first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest\" in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States,  Charles Horton Cooley, stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology \"probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since.\" It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including  \u00c9mile Durkheim, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim\u2019s  Division of Labour in Society  is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable  biologist, Spencer coined the term \" survival of the fittest \" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a  laissez-faire  style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the  United States  and  England.
