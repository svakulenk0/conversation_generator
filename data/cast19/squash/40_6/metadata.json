{"input_text": "Many New Pop artists created technologically oriented music that sweetened less commercial and experimental aspects with a  pop  coating.   Entryism  became a popular concept for groups at the time. New Music acts were danceable, had an  androgynous  look, emphasized the  synthesizer  and  drum machine s, wrote about the darker side of romance, and were  British . They rediscovered  rockabilly ,  Motown ,  ska ,  reggae  and merged it with African rhythms to produce what was described as a \"fertile, stylistic cross-pollination\". Author  Simon Reynolds  noted that the New Pop movement \"involved a conscious and brave attempt to bridge the separation between  'progressive' pop  and mass/chart pop \u2013 a divide which has existed since 1967, and is also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.\"\nCho Yong-pil (hangul: \uc870\uc6a9\ud544; hanja: \u8d99\u5bb9\u5f3c; also written Jo, Yong-pil) is a  South Korea n  pop  singer born in 1950. Many Korean Pop fans believe that Cho is one of the most influential figures in Korean pop music and has produced many hits of Korean pop music history, including \"Return to Busan Port\", \"Dear Friend\" and \"The Lady Outside the Window\".\nAt the age of 12, Rub\u00edn joined the group  Timbiriche , one of the most important and influential pop bands of the 1980s on the Spanish language charts.  His entry into the group transformed it into a sextet. His first album with the group their fourth album.

He is best known for hits such as \"M\u00e1gico amor\", \"\u00c1mame hasta con los dientes\" and \"Princesa Tibetana\".\nEmo pop began in the 1990s. Bands like  Jimmy Eat World ,  The Get Up Kids ,  The Promise Ring ,  The Starting Line ,  Saves the Day , and  The Movielife  were bands who started the emo pop style. Jimmy Eat World made an early emo pop sound off their album  Static Prevails  and their  Clarity  album, which was very influential on modern emo.\nNosotr\u00e4sh is a  Spanish   pop music  band formed in  Gijon  in 1994. Along with releasing records on the influential  Elefant Records  in  Spain , Nosotr\u00e4sh released a single in January 2007 in the  United States  with  Hugpatch .\nThe band's music includes elements from various genres such as  indie pop ,  dream pop ,  contemporary R&B ,  ambient ,  synthpop ,  soft rock ,  dubstep , and  UK bass . The band draw inspiration from various musical acts such as  Motown  artists,  Robert Glasper ,  Arthur Russell ,  Barry White ,  Herbie Hancock , and  Dexter Wansel . The band was also compared to numerous  alternative  and  R&B  acts, such as  My Bloody Valentine ,  The xx ,  New Order ,  The Cure ,  Ariel Pink ,  Drake  and  The Weeknd . The band described their musical style as \" Radiohead   quietstorm .\"\nAllMusic  biographer Matt Collar described the band's sound as influenced by \" melodic hardcore punk \". Collar later described the band's sound as  noise rock . The band is heavily influenced by early 90s acts such as  Sunny Day Real Estate  and  grunge  acts such as  Nirvana , as well as  emo  bands  The Promise Ring  and  Braid . On Songs About the Weather,  Punknews.org  reviewer Brian Shultz compared the band to the likes of  Title Fight , Daylight and Bearings. The EP's sound has been described as  pop punk .  I Wish I Could Stay Here  has been described as  emo , pop punk,  post-hardcore , and punk rock.  Colourmeinkindness  has been described as emo,  grunge , punk rock,  rock , and  alternative rock .

The Pakistani rock further matured itself and gained public appraisalwith the arrival of  American   satellite television  in the 1990s. The popular form of music quickly spread throughout the country and with that came the arrival of various rock bands in the 1990s. Early rock bands such as  Vital Signs  and  Junoon  are regarded as the pioneers of Pakistan's rock music. Other bands such as  Strings  began in the mid 1990s and during the late 1990s underground bands were becoming a norm in cities across Pakistan. In a short span of time, the Western-influenced rock bands gained enormous popularity and were generally welcomed by the public. The  Music Channel Charts  aired to NTM became the first pop/rock music entity that used to give ratings to pop/rock bands and singers.  Music '89  was the first ever all pop/rock music stage-show to be aired on  PTV .Cities such as  Karachi ,  Lahore  and  Islamabad  witnessed an explosion of rock bands and concerts in 2000 as Pakistan began to liberalize under President  Musharraf 's \" enlightened moderation \" campaign. In 2002, a major shift in the rock music of Pakistan occurred with the arrival of the Pepsi Battle of the Bands, which saw bands like Aaroh, Mizraab,  Entity Paradigm  and  Mekaal Hasan Band  appear onto the scene. Finally Pakistan saw good rock music, with respectable instrument playing. In 2006  Raeth  spread waves across the border by their debut song Bhula Doh.\nEarly recordings by The Hard-Ons such as Smell My Finger, Dickcheese, Love Is a Battlefield of Wounded Hearts and Yummy! set the blueprint for the group's sound: messy pop-punk with  metal  and  psychedelia  elements. Australian  music historian ,  Ian McFarlane , described their music as \"cheap and potent, their appeal selective. Yet never has so much been owed by so many to so few chords ... fused punk tempos, hardcore attitude, heavy metal riffs and surf-pop melodies into a seamless ball of energy\". A 1987 Beat Magazine article described their sound as \" Mot\u00f6rhead  meets the  Beach Boys \";  Allmusic 's Jody McGregor describes it as a \"mix of punk, pop, and metal\" with \"dashes of power pop, psychedelic rock, thrashy metal, and a healthy dose of humor\". Though originally inspired by punk bands such as  Sex Pistols ,  The Buzzcocks ,  The Damned ,  Ramones  and  The Saints , the band also blended pop, psychedelia and metal elements; \"death-pop\" as described by Ahn. The band were also noteworthy not only within punk but also within rock music for having their lead vocals handled by de Silva, the group's drummer. The physical challenge of drumming to the band's fast punk rock songs as well as singing (as opposed to shouting) made for charismatic live performances. Guitarist Black provided another original touch to the band with his distinctive guitar sound that is both melodic and messy, often making use of  feedback .\nPop and rock music are very popular too, and several bands have had considerable success over the years. Venezuelan pop musicians such as  Ricardo Montaner ,  Kiara ,  Karina ,  Los Chamos ,  Urbanda ,  Uff ,  Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez \"El Puma\" ,  Franco DeVita , and  Ilan Chester  have gained popularity in other Latin American countries. On the other hand, same history for a lot of well-known bands like  Devendra Banhart  ( Naturalismo ),  Aditus ,  Los Amigos Invisibles  ( Acid Jazz ),  Arkangel  founded by  Paul Gilmann  and  Freddy Marshall ,  Desorden Publico  ( Ska / Pop ),  King Chango  ( Ska / Latin American music ),  Culto oculto  ( Experimental / Rock ),  Caramelos de Cianuro  ( Pop / Rock ),  Mikel Erentxun  ( Pop / Rock ),  Candy 66 , Tan Fr\u00edo El Verano,  La Vida Boh\u00e8me  and the now extinct but influential groups  ( Sentimiento Muerto ) ( Post-punk ), ( Zapato 3 ) ( Pop / Rock ), and  Dermis Tat\u00fa  ( Rock ).\nUntil the beginning of the 1970s, Serbian rock bands released only  7\" single s and  extended play s.  Korni Grupa  was the first Serbian rock act to release a full-length album, in 1971, and one of the first bands to move towards  progressive rock . Progressive rock dominated the Serbian rock scene during the 1970s, with a part of bands incorporating elements of  traditional music  into their sound. At this period, bands like  YU Grupa ,  Pop Ma\u0161ina  and  Smak  achieved large mainstream popularity and massive album sales. The end of the 1970s featured the appearance of the prominent  hard rock  band  Riblja \u010corba , and the emergence of the closely associated  punk rock  and  new wave scene s.  Pekin\u0161ka Patka  was the first Serbian  punk rock  band to release an album, in 1980. The new wave bands  \u0160arlo Akrobata ,  Elektri\u010dni Orgazam  and  Idoli , which appeared on the influential compilation album  Paket aran\u017eman  in 1980, were followed by a large number of new wave acts. Around 1982, new wave scene declined and a large number of acts moved towards more commercial sound. During the 1980s,  pop rock  acts, such as  \u0110or\u0111e Bala\u0161evi\u0107  and  Bajaga i Instruktori , dominated the mainstream scene, but various other rock genres also emerged, and the  alternative rock  scene, with the acts such as  Ekatarina Velika ,  Disciplina Ki\u010dme , and  Rambo Amadeus , started to develop and gain mainstream popularity.\nThe album's second track, \"No Reply\", was covered by  SS Decontrol  on their 1983  EP   Get It Away . Influential  Seattle  band  The Fastbacks  recorded \"Whatever Happened To...?\" on their 1991 single \"My Letters\", released by  Sub Pop . The track \"Autonomy\" was covered by the  pop punk  band  The Offspring  on the single \"Want You Bad\".\nRolling Stone  described the band's sound as \"anthemic, emo-inflected rock\".  A Lesson in Romantics  has been described as  pop punk .  Anywhere but Here  has been described as pop punk and  pop rock .  Mayday Parade  has been described as pop punk and pop rock.  Monsters in the Closet  has been described as pop punk, pop rock and  rock .  Black Lines  has been described as  emo ,  emo pop , pop punk, and rock.\nSimon Underwood is an English bass guitarist best known as a member of the influential post-punk bands  The Pop Group  and  Pigbag . As described by punk rock producer Denis Bovell, Underwood was \"a wicked bass player... Together Simon and Bruce [Smith] were the  Sly & Robbie  of the punk period.\"\n\"When it comes to having inestimable influence, Blink-182 might well be contemporary punk's version of  the Beatles \", wrote Scott Heisel in a 2009  Alternative Press  cover story on the band. The same magazine later ranked Blink the fourth of the \"30 Most Influential Bands of the Past 30 Years,\" just behind  Radiohead ,  Fugazi , and  Nirvana . The new generation of pop punk and alternative rock fans found the Blink sound \"hugely influential,\" with Montgomery writing, \"... without them, there'd be no  Fall Out Boy , no  Paramore , or no  Fueled by Ramen Records .\" In 2011, The New York Times asserted that \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,\" stating that even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss  Warped Tour  punk bands, like  All Time Low  and  The Maine .\" Maria Sherman of  The Village Voice  took that sentiment a step further, writing \"It's pretty simple: Blink-182 is the most important band of the '90s, dick jokes and all. Apart from the sound, Blink's ideology has been popularized [\u2026] their presence is everywhere.\" According to  Kelefa Sanneh  of  The New Yorker , the group \"emerged as a touchstone, spawning more imitators than any American rock band since Nirvana.\" Bands such as  Panic! at the Disco  and All Time Low originated covering Blink-182 songs. \"Anyone in our genre would be lying if they said they weren't influenced by Blink-182,\" said  Joel Madden  of  Good Charlotte . Bands such as  You Me at Six  and  5 Seconds of Summer  have also named the band as influences.\nPower pop  music (as defined by groups such as  Badfinger ,  Cheap Trick ,  The Knack , and  The Romantics ) emerged in mostly the same time-frame and geographical area as punk rock, and they shared a great deal musically in terms of playing short songs loud and fast while trying to emphasize catchy feelings. More melodic and pop-influenced punk music have also often been wrapped alongside power pop bands under the general \" new wave music \" label. A good example of a genre-straddling 'power pop punk' band is the popular  Northern Ireland  group  Protex . However, stylistically and lyrically, power pop bands have tended to have a very not-punk top 40 commercial pop influence and a flashier, heavily teen-pop sense of fashion, especially modern power pop groups such as  Stereo Skyline  and  All Time Low .\nThe term \"indie\" had been used for some time to describe artists on independent labels (and the labels themselves). Both \"indie\" and \"indie pop\" had originally referred to the same thing during the late 1970s. A key moment in the naming of \"indie pop\" as a genre was the release of  NME s 1986 compilation  C86 , a followup to C81 (1981). American indie pop band  Beat Happening 's 1985  eponymous debut album  was influential in the development of the indie pop sound, particularly in North America.\nPakistani pop music refers to  popular music  forms in  Pakistan . Pakistani pop is a mixture of traditional Pakistani  classical music  and western influences of  jazz ,  rock and roll ,  hip hop  and  disco  sung in various  languages of Pakistan , including  Urdu . The popularity of music is based on the individual sales of a single, viewership of its music video or the singer's album chart positions. Apart from within Pakistan, Pakistani pop music has also achieved an influential following and popularity in neighboring countries and is listened by members of the  Pakistani diaspora , especially in the  Middle East ,  Europe  and  North America .\nIn the 1960s, Western pop music was particularly influential on local music scenes in  Malaysia ,  Singapore , and  Brunei . When  Cliff Richard and the Shadows  played in Singapore in 1961, he inspired many copycat acts, and public viewing of the Cliff Richard's films in the region were often augmented with local cover bands emulating their songs.  One particular genre influenced by Western guitar-band called 'Pop Yeh-yeh' came to the forefront and ruled the Malay music scene from 1965 to 1971. This genre was influenced by the music and fashion of  The Beatles  and other  British   rock and roll  bands during the 1960s that also generally influenced the Malay music industry of that period. In fact, the term \"pop yeh-yeh\" was taken from a line from the popular Beatles song, \" She Loves You \" (\"she loves you, yeah-yeah-yeah\"). The term \"pop yeh yeh\" however was never used in the 1960s but used much later when such music was revived in the 1980s by M. Shariff & The Zurah. It might be that music journalists of the 1980s coined the term.\nYMO were pioneers of  synthpop , a genre development  Simon Reynolds  believes to be \"perhaps the single most significant event in  melodic music  since  Mersey-beat \" with its influence still evident in contemporary rock and pop music. In 1993, Johnny Black of  Hi-Fi News , in a review for the record Hi-Tech/No Crime, described YMO as \"the most adventurous and influential  electro-techno-dance  technicians the world has produced\" and further argued that \"without them (and  Kraftwerk ) today's music would still sound like yesterday's music.\" In 2001, Jason Ankeny of the  Allmusic Guide to Electronica  described YMO Orchestra as \"a seminal influence on contemporary electronic music \u2013 hugely popular both at home and abroad\" and placed them \"second only to Kraftwerk as innovators of today's electronic culture.\"\nAs the dominant format of pop music  transitioned from singles to albums , many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements, where art rock would flourish. Wilson's unreleased  Smile , conceived and recorded in 1966\u201367, has been described as an attempt to create \"the great art pop album\" and the \"preeminent psychedelic pop art statement\" of the era.  The Who  was labelled \"the first pop art band\" by their manager, while member Pete Townshend explains: \"We stand for pop art clothes, pop art music and pop art behaviour ... we don't change offstage; we live pop art.\" Frith considers their album  The Who Sell Out  (1967) \"perhaps the Pop art pop masterpiece\", the Who using the \"vitality\" of commerce itself, a tactic echoed by  Roy Wood 's  the Move  and, later,  Kevin Godley  and  Lol Creme 's  10cc . Townshend's ideas were notable for their emphasis on commercialism: \"[his] use of Pop art rhetoric ... referred not to music-making as such \u2013 to the issue of self-expression \u2013 but to commercial music-making, to issues of packaging, selling and publicizing, to the problems of popularity and stardom.\"  Colin Larkin  portrays the Beatles' 1967 album  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  as \"no mere pop album but a cultural icon, embracing ... pop art, garish fashion, drugs, instant mysticism and freedom from parental control.\" Author Michael Johnson wrote that art pop music would continue to exist subsequent to the Beatles, but without ever achieving their popular success.\nLocksley is an  indie   four-piece   pop rock / power pop   band  from  Madison, Wisconsin . They are self-released on their own Feature Records label. Their songwriting is heavily influenced by early  British Invasion  bands with an instrumental style based more on early American punk bands and modern garage rock groups. The band describe their sound as doo-wop punk.\nSome of Indonesian pop bands are rekindle with their  Malay  roots and revived a genre called \"Band Pop Melayu\" (Pop Malay Band) and popular in late 2000s. The pop Malay bands are Kangen Band, WALI, Hijau Daun, Armada, Angkasa, and  ST 12 . This genre is the contemporary form of old Orkes Melayu style, once popular in the region across Indonesia and Malaysia.\nRocky Loves Emily has most commonly been identified as  pop rock , with comparisons including  The Maine ,  Hit the Lights ,  The Morning Light ,  Jack's Mannequin , and  All Time Low . Matt Collar of  AllMusic  described  Secrets Don't Make Friends  as containing \" power pop -influenced  rock  tunes\" and a delivery that matched the band's \" emo-pop  aesthetic\". Drummer Pete Kalinowski has defined the band's sound as \"pop, rock, with just a pinch of  country / classic rock .\" He also revealed that the band originally started with a \"weird  grungy / indie  sound\" before settling into pop, admitting that they \"didn't really know what we were trying to go for\" at the time.\nSarajevo is and has historically been one of the most important musical enclaves in the region. The  Sarajevo school of pop rock  developed in the city between 1961 and 1991. This type of music began with bands like  Indexi ,  Pro Arte , and singer/songwriter  Kemal Monteno . It continued into the 1980s, with bands such as  Plavi Orkestar ,  Crvena Jabuka , and  Divlje Jagode , by most accounts, pioneering the  regional  rock and roll movement. Sarajevo was also the home and birthplace of arguably the most popular and influential Yugoslav  rock band  of all time,  Bijelo Dugme , somewhat of a Bosnian parallel to the  Rolling Stones , in both popularity and influence. Sarajevo was also the home of a very notable  post-punk  urban subculture known as the  New Primitives , which began during the early 1980s with the Baglama Band which was banned shortly after first LP and was brought into the mainstream through bands such as  Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje  and Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 & His Meteors, as well as the  Top Lista Nadrealista  radio, and later television show. Other notable bands considered to be part of this subculture are  Bombaj \u0160tampa . Besides and separately from the  New Primitives , Sarajevo is the hometown to one of the most significant  ex-Yugoslavia n alternative  industrial - noise  bands,  SCH  (1983\u2013current).\nThe term \"jangle pop\" itself emerged as part of the genre's resurgence the early to mid-1980s that \"marked a return to the chiming or jangly guitars and pop melodies of the '60s\", and was epitomised by bands such as  The Smiths . Between 1983 and 1987, the description \"jangle pop\" was, in the US, used to describe bands like  R.E.M. ,  Let's Active  and  Tom Petty  as well as a subgenre called \" Paisley Underground \", which incorporated  psychedelic  influences. In the UK, the term was applied to the new wave of raw and immediate sounding melodic guitar-bands collected on the  NME\nThe record proved very influential on the  pop punk  genre. With the release of the record, Blink-182 became celebrities and the biggest pop punk act of the era. The glossy production instantly set Blink-182 apart from the other crossover punk acts, such as Green Day. Scott Russo of  Unwritten Law  remarked that he would receive CDs from fans that mimicked the \"pop punk\" sound the album made famous. \"It was revolutionary, it was equally as revolutionary as Green Day when it hit, they just didn't get the credit,\" Russo remarked in 2009. Matt Diehl, author of My So-Called Punk, writes that mainstream acolytes of their sound led to profound effects on the \"pop punk\" genre, such as the deracination of regional scene identity\u2014due to its wide popularity, pop punk bands became commonplace outside its origins. Jon Blisten of  Beats Per Minute  writes that \"Enema success perpetuated pop-punk\u2019s viability on mainstream radio, which is where Blink\u2019s progeny \u2014 bands like  Fall Out Boy ,  Simple Plan , and  New Found Glory  \u2014 would receive a decent amount of airplay.\"  Rolling Stone  Nicole Frehs\u00e9e wrote that the album influenced  emo  fans, while  MTV News  credited the album, alongside  The Get Up Kids '  Something to Write Home About  (1999) as pioneering  emo pop , calling them \"some of the scene\u2019s most influential records.\"\nRock and pop music in the 1980s built on the  post-punk  and  new wave  movements, incorporating different sources of inspiration from subgenres and what is now classed as  World music  in the shape of  Jamaican  and  Indian music , as did British Jazz, as a series of black British musicians came to prominence, creating new fusions like  Acid Jazz . It also explored the consequences of new technology and social change in the  electronic music  of  synthpop . In the early years of the decade, while subgenres like  heavy metal music  continued to develop separately, there was a considerable crossover between rock and more commercial popular music, with a large number of more \"serious\" bands, like  The Police  and  UB40 , enjoying considerable single chart success. The advent of  MTV  and cable video helped spur what has been seen as a  Second British Invasion  in the early years of the decade, with British bands enjoying more success in America than they had since the height of The Beatles' popularity in the 1960s. However, by the end of the decade there was a fragmentation, with many new forms of music and sub-cultures, including  Hip Hop  and  House music , while the single charts were once again dominated by pop artists, now often associated with the  Hi-NRG  hit factory of  Stock Aitken Waterman . The rise of the  Indie rock  scene was partly a response to this, and marked a shift away from the major music labels and towards the importance of local scenes like  Madchester  and subgenres, like  gothic rock .\nThe emergence of home-grown rock and pop music in the 1960s and 70s was built upon with enthusiasm in the 1980s, during which time several influential Lithuanian bands emerged.\nIn America (and also in  Australasia  and  Canada ) in the late Sixties, pop-rock acts including  The Grateful Dead ,  The Byrds  and  The Flying Burrito Brothers  then moved their music in a different direction. Drawing on their folk roots, and inspired by the hugely influential late '60's albums by  Bob Dylan  and  The Band , these bands began creating a new hybrid style that fused pop and rock with American  country music  and  bluegrass music , creating the genre now termed  country rock .\nSome of Indonesian pop bands are rekindled with their  Malay  roots and revived a genre called \"Band Pop Melayu\" (Pop Malay Band) and popular in the late 2000s. The pop Malay bands include  ST 12 .\nIn a feature for Noisey by Vice, Christina Cacouris describes Cigarettes After Sex as \"elemental, hazy and romantic, but with a noir edge underneath Gonzalez\u2019s androgynous voice\" as well as \"sweet and sentimental\". \"As the band\u2019s name suggests, it\u2019s reminiscent of lying in bed, but its ambient qualities don\u2019t prevent it from being music you can dance to.\" Gonzalez cites  Francoise Hardy  as his favorite singer and  Miles Davis  as having great impact. The band also includes  Trinity Sessions ,  Julee Cruise  and  Cocteau Twins  as influential. The music blog Eardrums Music describes the band as \"slow, dreamy and beautiful with gorgeous, tender vocals and very good lyrics.\" and compares it to  Mazzy Star  and early  Red House Painters . Music bloggers behind Swell Tone describe Cigarettes After Sex as a band producing \"melancholy, slow pop that will sweetly rock any listener into a listless stupor.\"\nStukas  and  Zaiko Langa Langa  were the two most influential bands to emerge from this era, with Zaiko Langa Langa being an important starting ground for musicians like  Pepe Feli ,  Bozi Boziana ,  Evoloko Jocker  and  Papa Wemba .  A smoother, mellower pop sound developed in the early 1970s, led by  Bella Bella ,  Shama Shama  and  Lipua Lipua , while  Kiamanguana Verckys  promoted a rougher  garage -like sound that launched the careers of  Pepe Kalle  and  Kanda Bongo Man , among others.\nPignoise is described as a  pop punk  band. Even though they have been seen wearing  NOFX  shirts in music videos, their light  punk rock  characteristics and their predominant  pop music  sound makes them clearly a  pop punk  band. They may also be considered  pop rock . The band cites  blink-182 ,  Green Day  or  The Offspring  as some of their main influences.\nProminent mainstream  pop  artists include:  Oliver Dragojevi\u0107 ,  Gibonni ,  Dino Dvornik ,  Toni Cetinski ,  Thompson  and others. Croatia is known for the specific  Dalmatia n sound performed at various festivals along the  Adriatic coast  with  Oliver Dragojevi\u0107  being one of the most eminent artists. Some of the most successful and long-lasting  rock music  acts that are treated as \"pop\" in Croatia include  Parni valjak  and  Prljavo kazali\u0161te . A highly acclaimed  singer-songwriter  is the  chanson -inspired  Arsen Dedi\u0107 . Internationally successful singer and songwriter  Ivo Robi\u0107  is a representative of the  Zagreb  school of  schlager .  Hip hop  bands such as  The Beat Fleet  and  Elemental  are also now treated as pop in Croatia. The  underground music  scene include popular  punk rock  bands  Hladno Pivo ,  Let 3 , and others. Two most popular pop-folk singers, and mainstream artists are  Severina  and  Jelena Rozga .\nThe group had already stockpiled plenty of material during their stint with Capitol and brief hiatus from recording.  The album features seven original songs and six covers\u2014the covers being drawn mostly from contemporary rock and pop musicians rather than traditionals.  The Dillards' blend between pop and bluegrass on this album paved the way for a generation of country- and folk-rockers, making it potentially their most influential album.\nInfluential bands in the scene were Pop Will Eat Itself (who had songs titled, \"Oh Grebo I Think I Love You\" and \"Grebo Guru\"),  The Wonder Stuff ,  Ned's Atomic Dustbin , along with London band  Carter USM  and  Leicester  bands  Crazyhead ,  The Bomb Party ,  The Hunters Club ,  Scum Pups  and  Gaye Bykers on Acid . London-based band Medicine Factory (later known as Stark) were also active on the scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The term has also been used to describe  Jesus Jones , who enjoyed success in both the UK and US. The musical styles of the bands were a blend of  garage rock , the more alternative forms of rock, pop, hip-hop, and  electronica . The musical genre found favour with adherents of the earlier  Post-punk  roots of  Gothic rock  such as  Mick Mercer  which by the late 1980s had changed character significantly.\nA vibrant and interesting punk and post-punk scene also developed in Perth, Western Australia. Bands such as  The Victims  and  Cheap Nasties , spawned icons of the Australian music scene such as Dave Faulkner and James Baker, who formed one of the most popular Australian bands of the 1980s, the power-pop band  Hoodoo Gurus , and the legendary  Kim Salmon , who formed  the Scientists , an influence on bands such as  Mudhoney  and  The Jesus Lizard . Kim Salmon claims to have been the first person to use the term  grunge  to describe music. Kim Salmon and James Baker later once again collaborated in the underground rock supergroup  Beasts of Bourbon , also featuring  Tex Perkins  and Spencer P. Jones. Perth also spawned the critically acclaimed indie-rock band  The Triffids .\nThe album's lead single, \" Notorious \" is produced by  Steve Mac  has been described as \"Black Eyed Peas-esque\" saying their new music sounds like something  The Black Eyed Peas  or  Rihanna  would release. The band described the song's lyrics as \"playful\" with a \"drop-out chorus\" and the song is often labelled \"it\u2019s a very cool\" by the band. Wonderland magazine asked the band to describe their new music in five words. They responded with \"current\", \"fun\", \"naughty\", \"girly\" and \"dancy\" When Wonderland questioned the band asking if the whole album would be like \" Notorious \".  Vanessa White  said that the album was a work in progress. She said they want a massive bunch of songs to pick from and they'll get the best ones from that. Where  Una Healy  stated, \"I think every artist needs to, sort of, reinvent themselves and we don\u2019t want any track to sound like it could have been on our previous albums. It\u2019s going to be a step up from the last album but we\u2019ll keep it The Saturdays-esque.\"  Rochelle Humes  said that \"Notorious\" does not influence the album's sound. She said that there are many different styles on the album, and they have records a fair few ballads. She went on to say that the new album will not have the same kind of feel to the previous albums. The band said that there is not a specific sound that is influencing the band. They said they like to into the studio and pick a beat and they build up the track from that moment on. They went on to say they've not thought about influencing on other artists songs as they want them to be all original.  Mollie King  said that the band get into twos or threes to write lyrics, she said although the band spend a lot of time together they also still have their five separate lives and yet they have so much to talk about, which means they never run out on lyrics as there are \"so many dramas\" going on around them,  as she said \"we're five girls after all\". While in an interview with  Sugarscape  the band confirmed that they want the whole album to be \"fresh\" and have a completely different sound from their previous albums, so it does not sound like the band are releasing the same type of music. They also said that the music would be \"current\" meaning they will release music which the public are interested in at the moment. However, they did say there would be some type of their \"original sound\" on the album as they want to \"make everyone welcome\" on the album. It was confirmed that the band been recording at Dean Street Studios,  London . and  Tracklacers  studios in Kent. The sound of the album will have a more edgier and dancing sound from the band. However, the band said that whey will still have their pop edge, but \"this time around\" they have taken the album through a bit of a more dancey route. They also went on to say that they want their music to reflect on their live shows, saying they want their concerts to be like \"one big giant party\" making the show and their music fun for everyone. They late said that the best night you could have out was at their December tour due to their music being \"bigger and better\" than before. According to Mollie King on the band's official website the band's influences are coming from  Britney Spears ' dance-pop style,  Adele  and  John Mayer 's  pop rock  style, where taking a dancier style to  Rihanna  and  Katy Perry 's style. The band stated their newest music is \"definitely more clubbier\" than their previous material. They said that the lyrics has a \"lot of man-bashing\" singing about how girls are better than boys, then calling themselves feisty on the album. They went on to say that the album sound is not a \"typical girlband sound\", they also said \"the great thing about pop music you get to try lots of different music\". The band said that the album tracks which they have recorded so far [June 2011] sounds great and different. They are writing a lot at the moment as they want the album to be bigger and better. \"All Fired Up\" track was labelled as the band as a \"floor filler\" \"All Fired Up\" was explained as think \"Ibiza closing party meets Miami poolside rave \u2013 the girls continue to blow us away as their signature pop vocals are played over a synth dance beat creating this anthemic dance banger.\" It was revealed by the band that  Travie McCoy  would feature a guest rap on the album.\nAtlanta has also produced rock and pop music singers, such as the folk-pop  Indigo Girls ,  The Black Crowes , Shawn Mullins,  The Changelings , alternative metal band  Sevendust , ska/punk band  Treephort , comedy-core pioneers  Attractive Eighties Women ,  Maserati , post-rock band  Light Pupil Dilate , dream-pop band  Seely ,  rock bands  Uncle Green  (a.k.a.  3 Lb.

During the early days of their career, Big Bang's music was predominantly  hip hop  and  pop rap , although they incorporated R&B songs into their albums as well.  A writer for Yahoo! Japan once compared their early materials to that of  American  hip-hop artists such as  The Black Eyed Peas , stating that their songs included \"catchy vocals, [...] rap and characters.\"  The song \"My Girl,\" Taeyang's first solo from the group's first album, was described as \"[s]mooth, sexy and bass-heavy,\" in reminiscent of  Omarion .  Similarly, Seungri's first solo from the same album, \"Next Day\" (Korean: \ub2e4\uc74c\ub0a0, Revised Romanization: Daeum Nal), was stated to have an \"intense \u201890s  Usher  vibes.\" Always (2007) was noted for its change of musical styles from their previous efforts, with the group experimenting with electronic dance music and setting it as the new music trend in Korea. G-Dragon later stated that they hoped \"to reach even more fans\" with the new direction.  In an interview, the group also expressed interest in covering the music genre  trot .  From their EP Hot Issue (2007), the \" shibuya-kei -influenced\" \"Fool\" (Korean: \ubc14\ubcf4; Revised Romanization: Babo) contained a \"heavy dance beat paired with a smooth disco coating,\" with G-Dragon's falsetto in the song garnering praise as a \"pleasant surprise.\" \"Day by Day\" from Stand Up (2008) was admired for \"weaving in and out of tempos seamlessly and forcing a sense of anxiety on the listener through the beating undercurrent\" and hailed as an \"experiential masterpiece.\" They also collaborated with the Korean rock-band  No Brain  for \"Oh My Friend,\" a  rock-based  song.  Alive (2012) was noted for being more \"experimental\" than their previous materials, with \"Blue\" being distinguished for including \"more interesting electronic samples and production techniques\" and \"Bad Boy\" described as having a \"nostalgic\" sentiment, being called a \"perfect pop song\", that \"transcends language.\"  The album was also praised for showcasing the group's voice instead of their usual autotune, being described as having \"a mature kind of intensity.\" Their song \"Monster\" was praised for its use of the piano and orchestra sound and the composition for \"Bingle Bingle\" (Korean: \ube59\uae00\ube59\uae00; Revised Romanization: Binggeul Binggeul) was noted for being electronic and retro, similar to the work of  Katy Perry  and  Daft Punk .  The group mixed a variety electronic music with  soft rock  for their Made (2015) series. \"Loser\" was cited for \"introduc[ing] a more mature style\" to the group \"without losing the images they had enforced through previous releases,\" while \"Bang Bang Bang\" was acclaimed for its  EDM -inspired sound and \"Bae Bae\" for its \"boundary-pushing elements\". In \"Let's Not Fall in Love,\" Big Bang was complimented for being at \"their most tender,\" with the song being described as having a \"lush production that evokes a range of emotions.\"Members of the band have branched out to other styles for solo projects, thus the group has been described as \"rich in variety\" for their fans.  Taeyang's EP Hot was mainly a collection of R&B songs, with the singer stating that this genre was his \"main focus.\"  Daesung's first digital single, \"Look at Me, GwiSoon\" (Korean: \ub0a0 \ubd10, \uadc0\uc21c, Revised Romanization: Nal Bwa Gwisoon), was a trot song, which drew criticism due to Big Bang's image as \"hip-hop artists.\"  For his debut album,  Heartbreaker , G-Dragon incorporated a mix of  dance , hip-hop, and R&B songs.  Justin Mccurry from The Guardian said that \"[e]ach of the five members has his own individual look, and their musical range is equally eclectic, covering R&B, hip-hop, house, electro and pop.\"  Producer and rapper  Cho PD  expressed appreciation for the group, stating how \" [i]dol singers  like Big Bang possess the ability [to be] musicians.\"  He was particularly fond of G-Dragon, citing the rapper as the \"main representative\" for the group's growth. Additionally, they have been described as \"artistic superheroes\" for showing \"versatility and success in whatever they do\" by rivaling companies. Their continued experimentation with a diverse range of musical styles and their distinct personalities have been highlighted as some of the main reasons for their popularity and longevity.  Mark James Russell, an entertainment journalist based in Seoul, praised the group for defying categorization, stating how \"[o]f all the mainstream acts, they\u2019re doing the most to push boundaries of what is considered K-pop.\"  Internationally, Big Bang is often referred to as a \"K-pop\" group, a label which they do not appreciate, with G-Dragon commenting that, \"We are Korean, so obviously they call our music K-pop. But we never thought of our music as K-pop. Our music is just our music.\u201d  In addition, T.O.P noted that \"[y]ou don\u2019t divide pop music by who\u2019s doing it. We don\u2019t say, for instance, \u2018white pop\u2019 when white people make music.\"\nSade and the band were credited as being Influential to neo soul, the band achieved success in the 1980s with music that featured a  sophisti-pop  style, incorporating elements of soul, pop, smooth jazz, and quiet storm. The band was part of a new wave of British R&B-oriented artists during the late-1980s and early 1990s that also included  Soul II Soul ,  Caron Wheeler ,  The Brand New Heavies ,  Simply Red ,  Jamiroquai , and  Lisa Stansfield .  Allmusic 's Alex Henderson writes that, \"Many of the British artists who emerged during that period had a neo-soul outlook and were able to blend influences from different eras\". Following the coining of the term \"quiet storm\" by Smokey Robinson, Sade was credited for helping give the genre a worldwide audience.\nBritish pop music is popular music, produced commercially in the  United Kingdom . It emerged in the mid-to late 1950s as a softer alternative to  rock 'n' roll  and later to rock music. Like American pop music it has a focus on commercial recording, often orientated towards a youth market, as well as that of the  Singles Chart  usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs. While these basic elements of the genre have remained fairly constant, pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of  popular music , particularly borrowing from the development of rock music, and utilising key technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. From the British Invasion of the 1960s, led by  The Beatles , British pop music has alternated between acts and genres with national appeal and those with international success that have had a considerable impact on the development of the wider genre and on popular music in general.\nAppleton is one of the founding members of the popular New York based band The Grasshoppers along with Mario Joachim and David Hamburger. The Grasshoppers, who counted among their fans  Paul McCartney ,  Jeff Buckley  and the conductor  Seiji Ozawa , have been described in reviews as \"One of the most influential and melodic rock / pop bands on the New York City Scene in the mid 90's.\"\nEmo pop was influenced by  emo  and  pop punk . Bands such as  The Wrens ,  Weezer ,  Sense Field  and  Jawbreaker  were emo bands who influenced and set the blueprints for the emo pop genre.  The Get Up Kids  even made a major emo pop album called  Something to Write Home About . They also influenced many newer emo pop bands like  Fall Out Boy  who were also influenced by bands like  New Found Glory ,  Green Day ,  Screeching Weasel ,  Lifetime ,  Earth Crisis ,  Gorilla Biscuits  and  The Ramones . Pop punk band  Blink-182  have been a very big influence on emo pop. The new generation of pop punk, emo pop and alternative rock fans view the Blink-182 sound as \"hugely influential,\" with even Montgomery writing, \"... without them, there'd be no Fall Out Boy, no  Paramore , or no  Fueled by Ramen Records .\" The  emo / punk rock  band Jawbreaker has influenced bands like  Fall Out Boy  and  My Chemical Romance .\nNevertheless, much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. The terms \"pop-rock\" and \"power pop\" have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from, or the form of, rock music. Pop-rock has been defined as an \"upbeat variety of rock music represented by artists such as Elton John,  Paul McCartney ,  the Everly Brothers ,  Rod Stewart ,  Chicago , and  Peter Frampton .\" The term power pop was coined by  Pete Townshend  of  the Who  in 1966, but not much used until it was applied to bands like  Badfinger  in the 1970s, who proved some of the most commercially successful of the period.\nAlthough they had only one  Top 40  hit, \"Claire\" in 1995, they were simultaneously one of Canada's most influential and unconventional rock bands, a band whose eclectic take on pop and rock music has been described both as iconic and iconoclastic. In particular, two of the band's albums,  Whale Music  and  Melville , have been cited in numerous critical and listener polls as among the best Canadian albums ever recorded.\nBlink-182 is considered a key group in the development of  pop punk ; the band's combination of  pop  melodies with fast-paced  punk rock  featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States, and over 35 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,\" and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of  Fall Out Boy  or in the current wave of high-gloss  Warped Tour  punk bands, like  All Time Low  and  The Maine .\"\nMama Quilla II was a Canadian rock band that first performed together in 1977 in  Toronto  and dissolved in 1982. Although the band recorded only a single  EP  as Mama Quilla II, after 1982 a revised lineup evolved into the influential pop band  Parachute Club .\nWhereas rock musicians in Japan usually hate the term \"pop\", Taro Kato, a member of  pop punk  band  Beat Crusaders , pointed out that the encoded  pop music , like  pop art , was catchier than \"J-pop\" and he also said that J-pop was the  music, memorable for its frequency of airplay, in an interview when the band completed their first full-length studio album under a major label,  P.O.A.: Pop on Arrival , in 2005. Because the band did not want to perform J-pop music, their album featured the  1980s Pop  of  MTV . According to his fellow band member Toru Hidaka, the 1990s music that influenced him (such as  Nirvana ,  Hi-Standard , and  Flipper's Guitar ) was not listened to by fans of other music in Japan at that time.\nNight Riots' foundations lie within  punk rock ; they cite bands  AFI  and  Thursday  as their biggest influences. They also draw influence from  Billy Idol ,  Paul Simon ,  Peter Gabriel ,  Arctic Monkeys ,  Atmosphere ,  The Cure ,  U2 ,  The Killers ,  Vampire Weekend ,  The Strokes ,  Bruce Springsteen ,  INXS  and  Dave Gahan . PK integrated  pop rock  and  power pop  into their sound, accompanied with \"introspective and emotional\" lyrics with music that \"is always lively and upbeat\". The band changed its name to Night Riots in order to represent \"its darker side as it explores the deeper aspects of music with varying tempos and somber, haunting melodies juxtaposed against uplifting choruses.\" An  alternative rock  band, they incorporate  new wave music , as well as a 1980s  Gothic pop  feel into their current sound. Hawley distinguished Night Riots' music from PK by describing it as  indie pop rock  with a \"dark undertone\", comparing the sound to U2, The Strokes, and The Killers. He also describes the band's sound as \"gloom pop\" because of the vein of darkness that runs throughout the alternative/pop sounding music. Guitarist Matt DePauw described the band's sound as \"catchy rock 'n' roll with a bit of pop and a bit of darkness\".\nOctavia is the name of a Bolivian  Rock pop  band characterized by a unique mix of catchy pop sounds,  Andean music , use of electronic synthesizers, and  acoustic music . The band's sound is continually evolving but it is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential bands in the history of Bolivian rock.\nThe discography of Spanish pop rock band  La Oreja de Van Gogh  consists of six  studio album s, one  live album , two  compilation album s, one  extended play , one  box set , thirty five  single s  and twenty six  music video s. The band have sold over 8 million records worldwide, making them the best selling pop band in Spain and the country's most influential pop group since  Mecano . La Oreja de Van Gogh released their debut studio album  Dile Al Sol  on May 18 of 1998. It was a commercial success in Spain, eventually peaking at #1 and being certified 7 times Platinum in the country. The band's second studio album,  El viaje de Copperpot , was released on September 11 of 2000. It is the band's most successful album in Spain; selling more than 1,200,000 copies there, becoming Sony's Spain second highest selling album in history. It also catapulted the band's fame and success in  Latin America . The first three singles  reached #1 in Spain, Mexico and most latinamerican countries.\nPop bands have seen great popularity, topped by  Bandana , the most popular. Other artists in this genre include  Miranda!  with a touch of \"electro\" sound,  Alejandro Lerner ,  Axel (singer) ,  Valeria Lynch ,  Mar\u00eda Jimena Pereyra  and  Babas\u00f3nicos , of lasting popularity. Artists combining experimentation with  glam  include  Airbag  and Juana la Loca, in addition to  Arbol , an artist combining hardcore with pop and violins. Lali Esp\u00f3sito  is the greatest exponent of pop music in Argentina in recent years.\nPop-influenced punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s with a music style that was stylistically similar to  power pop . By the mid-1980s, several bands merged  hardcore punk  with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as  Dag Nasty ,  the Nip Drivers ,  T.S.O.L. ,  Social Distortion , and the  Descendents . Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid to late 1980s. Pop punk particularly  thrived in California , where  independent record label s adopted a  do it yourself  (DIY) approach to releasing music. By the mid 1990s, a few pop punk bands had started to sell millions of records and receive extensive radio and television airplay, such as  Green Day . By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of  Blink-182 's  Enema of the State , represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s. In the mid-2000s,  emo pop , a fusion genre combining  emo  and pop punk, became popular. By the end of the 2000s, the pop punk sound of the 1990s had largely waned in mainstream popularity.\nEmo  is a style of  rock music  characterized by melodic musicianship and expressive, often confessional lyrics. It originated in the mid-1980s  hardcore punk  movement of  Washington, D.C. , where it was known as \"emotional hardcore\" or \"emocore\" and pioneered by bands such as  Rites of Spring  and  Embrace . As the style was echoed by contemporary American  punk rock  bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with  pop punk  and  indie rock  and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as  Jawbreaker  and  Sunny Day Real Estate . By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the  Midwestern  and  Central United States , and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style.\nBlack Tambourine was an American  twee pop  band and one of the earliest  Slumberland  groups of the early 1990s. Formed in  Silver Spring, Maryland , the band comprised vocalist Pam Berry and instrumentalists Archie Moore, Brian Nelson and Mike Schulman. Along with  Tiger Trap ,  Lois ,  Honeybunch ,  Tullycraft , and  Beat Happening , they are considered to be one of the most influential bands of the American twee pop movement.\nOne Direction's debut studio album, Up All Night (2011), is predominantly a pop music record, containing elements of  teen pop ,  dance-pop ,  pop rock , with  electropop  and  rock  influences.  Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey described the album as a \"collection of PG pop rock with killer choruses\", while  The New York Times  considered it \"full of easy rock-inflected pop, blithe and sometimes clever.\" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard acknowledged that the album demonstrates an originality in sound that was \"necessary for the revitalization of the boy band movement\". The songs \"One Thing\" and \"What Makes You Beautiful\" were particularly noted for the genres of power pop and pop rock, for their \"powerhouse\"  guitar riff s and \"forceful\" choruses.\nAlthough the formative influences on the genre were primarily British, the bands that developed and codified power pop in the 1970s were nearly all American. The Raspberries' 1972 hit single \" Go All The Way \" is an almost perfect embodiment of the elements of power pop and that group's four albums can be considered strongly representative of the genre. In addition to his late 1960s band, Nazz, some of  Todd Rundgren 's early 1970s solo work touched on power pop, as did the recordings of  Blue Ash , the  Flamin' Groovies ,  Artful Dodger  and, in particular,  the Dwight Twilley Band  (whose hit \"I'm on Fire\" is emblematic of the genre's hybridity). The most influential group of the period may have been  Big Star . Though Big Star's initial early 1970s career met with no commercial success, they developed an avid  cult following  and members of later bands like  R.E.M.  and  the Replacements  spoke enthusiastically of their esteem for the group's work. The Replacements even recorded a song entitled \" Alex Chilton \" in honor of Big Star's frontman.\nThe \"golden era\" of  pop  and  rock  in Vojvodina, as elsewhere in  Serbia  were 1980s, when the  new wave  explosion launched several excellent bands. The most relevant bands from that period were short-living but influential punkers  Pekin\u0161ka patka , pop experimentists  Laboratorija zvuka  and arty  La strada  led by  Slobodan Ti\u0161ma . In the 1990s, the most outstanding bands were  Obojeni program  and  Love Hunters  from Novi Sad. In the late 1990s and 2000s, a stream of pop bands also gained limited popularity ( Oru\u017ejem protivu otmi\u010dara ,  Zbogom Brus Li ,  Instant karma ).\nThe Ramones had a broad and lasting influence on the development of  popular music . Music historian  Jon Savage  writes of their debut album that \"it remains one of the few records that changed pop forever.\" As described by  AllMusic  critic  Stephen Thomas Erlewine , \"The band's first four albums set the blueprint for punk, especially American punk and hardcore, for the next two decades.\" Trouser Presss Robbins and Isler similarly wrote that the Ramones \"not only spearheaded the original new wave/punk movement, but also drew the blueprint for subsequent hardcore punk bands\". Punk journalist Phil Strongman writes, \"In purely musical terms, the Ramones, in attempting to re-create the excitement of pre-Dolby rock, were to cast a huge shadow\u2014they had fused a blueprint for much of the indie future.\" Writing for  Slate  in 2001,  Douglas Wolk  described the Ramones as \"easily the most influential group of the last 30 years.\"\nBy the late 2000s, club promoters in the United Kingdom created nights based around lasting appreciation of the  pop punk  genre, including one named after \"What's My Age Again?\", described as a night celebrating \"pop-punk, youthful abandon and teenage riot\".  Rolling Stone  Nicole Frehs\u00e9e wrote that, \"For a new generation of emo fans and bands, Blink's irreverent, upbeat take on punk rock with hits like \"What's My Age Again?\" and \"All the Small Things\" was hugely influential.\"\nYuval Banay (; born June 9, 1962) is an Israeli musician, best known as the lead singer of the influential Israeli  pop rock  band  Mashina .\nStarting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album. According to engineer  Geoff Emerick , \"the Beatles were looking to go out on a limb, both musically and sonically ... we were utilising a lot of  tape   varispeeding  and other manipulation techniques ...  limiters  and ... effects like  flanging  and  ADT .\" Their recording of \" A Day in the Life \" required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the  double A-side  single \" Strawberry Fields Forever \"/\" Penny Lane \" in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's \" She's Leaving Home \" was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as \"[among] the finest work on Sgt. Pepper\u2014imperishable popular art of its time\". Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by  pop art ists  Peter Blake  and  Jann Haworth , featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with  a host of celebrities . The heavy moustaches worn by the Beatles reflected the growing influence of  hippie  style trends on the band, while their clothing \"spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions\", wrote Gould. Scholar David Scott Kastan described Sgt. Pepper as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".\nBritpop emerged from the British  independent music  scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands influenced by British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s. The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the  grunge  phenomenon from the United States. New British groups such as  Suede  and  Blur  launched the movement by positioning themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music of the past and writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. These bands were soon joined by others including  Oasis ,  Pulp ,  Supergrass  and  Elastica . Britpop groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement called  Cool Britannia . Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement largely fell apart by the end of the decade. After the decline of Britpop, British indie was kept alive by \"post pop\" bands including  Radiohead ,  Feeder ,  Stereophonics  and  Travis , who largely abandoned the elements of national and retro-60s culture. Recently British indie bands with a foot in both the rock and pop camps has experienced a resurgence, spurred in part by the international success of  The Strokes . Like modern American indie rock, many British indie bands such as  Franz Ferdinand ,  The Libertines  and  Bloc Party  are influenced by post-punk groups such as Joy Division,  Wire , and  Gang of Four . Other prominent independent in the 2000s include:  Editors ,  The Fratellis ,  Razorlight ,  Keane ,  Kaiser Chiefs ,  Coldplay  and  Arctic Monkeys , the last the most prominent act to owe their success to the use of internet social networking.\nby Bruce Eder.
