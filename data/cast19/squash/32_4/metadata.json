{"input_text": "Cetaceans  attained their greatest diversity during the Miocene, with over 20 recognized genera in comparison to only six living genera. This diversification correlates with emergence of gigantic macro-predators such as megatoothed sharks and raptorial  sperm whale s. Prominent examples are C. megalodon and  L. melvillei . Other notable large sharks were  C. chubutensis , Isurus hastalis, and  Hemipristis serra .\nIt is believed to have been a sluggish  bottom-dwelling  shark, rather than an actively fast swimmer. It lived about 89 million years ago (Turonian stage). Therefore, while only large numbers of its teeth, and jaw fragments are known, it might've resembled a massive nurse shark or a sand tiger shark.\nSpotty11222/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain. Not only was Megalodon the biggest prehistoric shark that ever lived; it was the largest marine predator in the history of the planet, vastly outweighing both the modern Great White Shark and ancient reptiles like Liopleurodon and Kronosaurus.\nThe megalodon shark (C. megalodon) is widely regarded as both the largest shark to have ever lived on Earth and one of the largest vertebrate predators in history. Megalodons roamed the seas from around 28 million years ago until ~1.6 million years ago, when they were wiped out during the Pleistocene extinction.\nFrom the blue shark to the whale shark, what are the 20 largest sharks? Check out this list of the 20 largest sharks from Shark Week.\nFact #1. The Megalodon Shark Was The Largest Predator That Ever Lived. Reaching lengths of up to 60 feet and an estimated maximum weight of over 60 tons, the Megalodon is the largest known predator in Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. The modern Sperm Whale is longer, but probably not as heavy as the Megalodon.\nThe biggest ever tiger shark is believed to have measured 7.3 metres and weighed 6,860lbs. The shark was caught off the China-Indonesia coast. Worldwide, 1.5bn BCE. The biggest shark ever to have lived is the Carcharodon megalodon.\nThe biggest shark ever to have lived is the Carcharodon megalodon. Although now extinct, it is still listed in the Guinness World Records as the largest shark at 16 m (53 ft) long. Its mouth perhaps was estimated to be two metres (6ft) wide. It went extinct about 1.5 million years ago.\nThe biggest shark to have EVER lived, is the Megalodon, a giant prehistoric shark and a legendary killer that still secretly strikes fear into the hearts of anything and everything that dares to venture out into the sea. Its name comes from a Greek word meaning \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig Tooth\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nThe largest shark to have ever lived on Earth is thought by scientists to have been the megalodon. Its name comes from the Greek words meaning \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig tooth.. The megalodon is an extinct species of shark that roamed the waters of Earth over 1.5 million years ago.\nBut at 60 or so tons, the middle Eocene Basilosaurus was certainly the biggest prehistoric whale that ever lived, outweighing even the much later Leviathan (which itself may have tangled with the biggest prehistoric shark of all time, Megalodon) by 10 or 20 tons.\nThe Megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon, was largest shark of all time. It lived from the late Oligocene to early Pleistocene epochs, 20 to 1.5 million years ago. This giant of a shark was a huge version of the current great white shark. The word megalodon is a Greek word and means big tooth. Megalodon had teeth, which are among the largest ever found, over 18 cm long. The are believed to be as long as 16 meters and weigh over 60 tons. Megalodon hunted large and medium-sized whales, attacking the bony areas, such as chest or fins. This would stop the whale, or it could kill quickly with a fatal bite to the chest region. Megalodon could bite with the one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom's history. The skeleton of a Megalodon was made of cartilage, so it will be impossible to find complete remains of these animals. Megalodon teeth, however were bone and can be found in all oceans, which shows that the sharks were all over the world.\nKaren Carr, via Wikimedia Commons. Around 28 million years ago, the largest shark to have ever lived on Earth roamed the seas, tearing apart large marine mammals such as whales and dolphins.\nMegalodon was the biggest shark that ever lived, but just how big was it? Paleontologists aren't quite sure, but most agree that Megalodon grew to at least 52 feet. A study published in 2013 suggests a maximum length of 59 feet - roughly three times as long as the longest great white!\nWhen Did Megalodon Disappear From The Oceans? Around 28 million years ago, the largest shark to have ever lived on Earth roamed the seas, tearing apart large marine mammals such as whales and dolphins. Measuring up to 18 meters in length, armed with teeth up to 7 inches long, the iconic Carcharocles megalodon (\u00e2\u0080\u009cMegalodon\u00e2\u0080\u009d) was a formidable predator.\nThe Megalodon is an extinct species of shark. The largest species of shark to have ever lived is thought to be the Megalodon. This species is now extinct. It is believed to ha \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ve existed during the prehistoric era, and has not lived for millions of years. It is thought that this giant shark could measure up to 59 feet long (18 metres).\nBloodthirstiness of sharks captivate our imagination. Now we present a ranking of the largest sharks of the modern world. Therefore, you will not find on the list the largest shark of all time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Megalodon that whales ate for breakfast :), because it already gave up the ghost for good 2.6 million years ago. Even if you believe that the Megalodon is still alive, we ensure you that for a long time this shark is no longer on Earth.", "key": "32_4", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:58.982841", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
