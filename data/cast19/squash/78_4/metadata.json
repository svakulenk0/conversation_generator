Hello and welcome to my \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutoimmune Protocol Page\u00e2\u0080\u009d where I share information and links about The Autoimmune Protocol (also known as The Paleo Autoimmune Protocol or AIP). The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) is a diet used to heal autoimmune disease and inflammatory disease.ome people stay on the AIP for 30 days as an elimination diet (then add other foods back into their diet), others do it long-term to heal chronic disease as a permanent lifestyle change.
