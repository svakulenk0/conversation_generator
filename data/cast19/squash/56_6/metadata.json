{"input_text": "Darwin gave new direction to  morphology  and  physiology , by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a  genealogical  basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of  spontaneous generation  and the rise of the  germ theory of disease , though the mechanism of  inheritance  remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of  Mendel's  work led to the rapid development of  genetics  by  Thomas Hunt Morgan  and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of  population genetics  and natural selection in the \" neo-Darwinian synthesis \".\n\"Survival of the fittest\" is sometimes claimed to be a  tautology . The reasoning is that if one takes the term \"fit\" to mean \"endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction\" (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then \"survival of the fittest\" can simply be rewritten as \"survival of those who are better equipped for surviving\". Furthermore, the expression does become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of \"fitness\" in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power.\nThe most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck ; based on the  inheritance of acquired characteristics  (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist  Charles Darwin , combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell,  Thomas Malthus 's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on  natural selection ; similar evidence led  Alfred Russel Wallace  to independently reach the same conclusions.  Charles Darwin 's early interest in nature led him on a  five-year voyage  on  which established him as an eminent  geologist  whose observations and theories supported  Charles Lyell 's  uniformitarian  ideas, and publication of his  journal of the voyage  made him famous as a popular author. Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and  fossil s he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the  transmutation of species  and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when  Alfred Russel Wallace  sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of  both of their theories .Darwin's  On the Origin of Species , published on 24 November 1859, a seminal work of scientific literature, was to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.\nDebate over Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution, but the specific mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in  biology  that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s. Before that time most  biologist s regarded other factors as responsible for evolution. Alternatives to natural selection suggested during \" the eclipse of Darwinism \" (circa 1880 to 1920) included  inheritance of acquired characteristics  ( neo-Lamarckism ), an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ), and sudden large  mutation s ( saltationism ).  Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th Century experiments with  pea  plant variations rediscovered in 1900, was integrated with natural selection by  Ronald Fisher ,  J. B. S. Haldane , and  Sewall Wright  during the 1910s to 1930s, and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of  population genetics . During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields, resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology\u2014the  modern evolutionary synthesis .\nThe  evolution of sexual reproduction  as well as its maintenance, is another mystery in biology. The purpose of  sexual reproduction  is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (\ufb01tness disadvantage) in relation to  asexual reproduction .  Mating type s (types of  gamete s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of  anisogamy  (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy. It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary  mating system , and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism.  Charles Darwin  was the first to suggest that  sexual selection  drives  speciation  (the formation of  species ); without sexual reproduction it is unlikely that complex life would have evolved.\nDarwin's contemporaries eventually came to accept the transmutation of species based upon  fossil  evidence, and the  X Club  was formed to defend evolution against the church and wealthy amateurs. However, the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided\u2014natural selection\u2014was actively disputed by scientists in favour of alternative theories such as  Lamarckism  and  orthogenesis . Darwin's  gradualistic  account was also opposed by  saltationism  and  catastrophism .  Lord Kelvin  led scientific opposition to gradualism on the basis of his thermodynamic calculations that the  Earth  was  between 24 and 400 million years old , an estimate disputed by geologists. These figures were corrected in 1907 when radioactive dating of rocks showed that the Earth was billions of years old. Kelvin's own views favoured a version of theistic evolution accelerated by divine guidance. The specific  hereditary  mechanism Darwin provided,  pangenesis , lacked any supporting evidence. Although evolution was unchallenged, uncertainties about the mechanism in  the eclipse of Darwinism  persisted from the 1880s until the 1930s  inclusion of  Mendelian inheritance  and the rise of the  modern evolutionary synthesis . The modern synthesis rose to universal acceptance among biologists with the help of new evidence, such as  genetics , which confirmed Darwin's predictions and refuted the competing theories.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s,  Mendel's  theory of inheritance and Darwin's theory of evolution by  natural selection  were joined in what was called the  modern evolutionary synthesis . This conjunction of theories also had a large impact on how biologists think about species.  Edward Poulton  anticipated many ideas on species that today are well accepted, and that were later more fully developed by  Theodosius Dobzhansky  and  Ernst Mayr , two of the architects of the modern synthesis. Dobzhansky's 1937 book articulated the genetic processes that occur when incipient species are beginning to diverge. In particular, Dobzhansky described the critical role, for the formation of new species, of the evolution of  reproductive isolation .\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern  biology . The concept, published by Darwin and  Alfred Russel Wallace  in a  joint presentation of papers in 1858 , was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life , which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional  Darwinian evolution  with subsequent discoveries in  classical genetics  formed the  modern evolutionary synthesis  of the mid-20th century. The addition of  molecular genetics  has led to  evolutionary developmental biology , which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random  genetic drift , natural selection remains the primary explanation for  adaptive evolution .\nPerhaps the most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of  evolution  by  natural selection  put forward by the British naturalist  Charles Darwin  in his book  On the Origin of Species  in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both  opposition and support  from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of \"man's place in the universe\". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the  Moravia n monk  Gregor Mendel  in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of  genetics , which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953,  James D. Watson ,  Francis Crick  and  Maurice Wilkins  clarified the basic structure of DNA, the  genetic material  for expressing life in all its forms. In the late 20th century, the possibilities of  genetic engineering  became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human  genome  (the  Human Genome Project ).\nThe Genetical Theory of Natural Selection  was first published in 1930 by  Clarendon Press  and is dedicated to  Leonard Darwin . A core work of the neo-Darwinian  modern evolutionary synthesis , it helped define  population genetics , which Fisher founded alongside  Sewall Wright  and  J. B. S. Haldane , and revived the idea of  sexual selection , neglected since Darwin's death. Commonly cited in biology books, it outlines many important concepts, such as:\nThe Genetical Theory of Natural Selection is a book by  Ronald Fisher  which combines  Mendelian genetics  with  Charles Darwin 's theory of  natural selection , with Fisher being the first to argue that \"Mendelism therefore validates Darwinism\" and stating with regard to  mutation s that \"The vast majority of large mutations are deleterious; small mutations are both far more frequent and more likely to be useful\", thus refuting  orthogenesis . First published in 1930 by  The Clarendon Press , it is one of the most important books of the  modern evolutionary synthesis , and helped define  population genetics . It is commonly cited in biology books, outlining many concepts that are still considered important such as  Fisherian runaway ,  Fisher's principle ,  reproductive value ,  Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection ,  Fisher's geometric model , the  sexy son hypothesis ,  mimicry  and the  evolution of dominance . It was dictated to his wife in the evenings as he worked at  Rothamsted Research  in the day.\nAlthough Delbr\u00fcck's  Rockefeller Foundation  fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with  Vanderbilt University  in  Nashville, Tennessee , where from 1940 to 1947 he taught  physics , yet had his laboratory in the biology department.  In 1941, Delbr\u00fcck met  Salvador Luria  of  Indiana University  who began visiting Vanderbilt.  In 1942,  Delbr\u00fcck and Luria published  on  bacteria l resistance to  virus  infection mediated by random  mutation .   Alfred Hershey  of  Washington University  began visiting in 1943. The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel\u2019s experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin\u2019s theory was provided when Thomas Morgan Hunt discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin\u2019s ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code.\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern  biology . The term was introduced by Darwin in his groundbreaking 1859 book  On the Origin of Species , in which natural selection was described by analogy to  artificial selection , a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favored for reproduction. The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of  heredity ; at the time of Darwin's writing, nothing was known of modern genetics. The union of traditional  Darwinian evolution  with subsequent discoveries in  classical  and  molecular genetics  is termed the  modern evolutionary synthesis . Natural selection remains the primary explanation for  adaptive evolution .\nThe term Darwinism is often used in the United States by promoters of  creationism , notably by leading members of the  intelligent design movement , as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an \"ism\") of  philosophical naturalism , or  atheism . For example,  UC Berkeley   law  professor and author  Phillip E. Johnson  makes this accusation of atheism with reference to  Charles Hodge 's book What Is Darwinism? (1874). However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American  botanist   Asa Gray  who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: \"It is Atheism.\" Creationists use the term Darwinism, often pejoratively, to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as  dogma tic and inflexible in their  belief . In the 2008  documentary  film  Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed , which promotes  intelligent design  (ID), American writer and actor  Ben Stein  refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for  Scientific American ,  John Rennie  says \"The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to  Marxism .\"\nOne of the first and most important naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the  X Club  to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with  naturalism  and to end the domination of British  natural science  by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of  Archaeopteryx  in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in  North America . Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as  France , and the countries of southern Europe and  Latin America  was slower. An exception to this was  Germany , where both  August Weismann  and  Ernst Haeckel  championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the  Scientific Revolution  from the 17th century and the United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include  Isaac Newton , whose  laws of motion  and illumination of  gravity  have been seen as a keystone of modern science; from the 19th century  Charles Darwin , whose theory of  evolution  by  natural selection  was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and  James Clerk Maxwell , who formulated classical  electromagnetic theory ; and more recently  Stephen Hawking , who has advanced major theories in the fields of  cosmology ,  quantum gravity  and the investigation of  black holes .\nMany of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin's theory of evolution with  Mendel 's theories of inheritance and genetics. Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky , called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that \" Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs. Nevertheless, some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today:  Louis Pasteur , for example, opposed the theory of  spontaneous generation  with  biogenesis , an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on  chemical evolution  and  abiogenesis . Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.\nCharles Darwin 's publication of the  On the Origin of Species  in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx , an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen . Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.  Thomas Huxley  would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of  natural selection  as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Henry Fairfield Osborn  preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism , the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and  orthogenesis , an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.\nIn the so-called  modern evolutionary synthesis  of the 1930s and 1940s,  Ronald Fisher  brought together Darwin's theory of  evolution , with its insistence on natural selection,  heredity , and  variation , and  Gregor Mendel 's  laws of genetics  into a coherent structure for  evolutionary biology . Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through  mutation s in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: but it did not explain embryology.\nModern evaluation of the book is from a variety of perspectives, including the history of Darwinism, the history of the Thayer debate on the purpose of camouflage, the mechanisms of camouflage, sexual selection, and mimicry. Beddard is seen as having covered a wide swath of modern biology with both theory and experiment.\nIn the end, the two approaches were combined, especially by work conducted by  R. A. Fisher  as early as 1918.  The combination, in the 1930s and 1940s, of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of  natural selection  resulted in the  modern synthesis  of evolutionary biology.\nAnders Hald  called him \"a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science\", while  Richard Dawkins  named him \"the greatest biologist since  Darwin . Not only was he the most original and constructive of the architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. Fisher also was the father of modern statistics and experimental design. He therefore could be said to have provided researchers in biology and medicine with their most important research tools, as well as with the modern version of biology's central theorem.\" and  Geoffrey Miller  said of him \"To biologists, he was an architect of the 'modern synthesis' that used mathematical models to integrate Mendelian genetics with Darwin's selection theories. To psychologists, Fisher was the inventor of various statistical tests that are still supposed to be used whenever possible in psychology journals. To farmers, Fisher was the founder of experimental agricultural research, saving millions from starvation through rational crop breeding programs.\"\nPrecise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of  pangenesis . In 1865,  Gregor Mendel  reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the  independent assortment  and segregation of elements (later known as  gene s). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.  August Weismann  made the important distinction between  germ cell s that give rise to  gamete s (such as  sperm  and  egg cell s) and the  somatic cell s of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only.  Hugo de Vries  connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the  cell nucleus  and when expressed they could move into the  cytoplasm  to change the  cell s structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as  Ronald Fisher ,  Sewall Wright  and  J. B. S. Haldane  set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and  Mendelian inheritance  was thus reconciled.\nEarly in his career, Gould and  Niles Eldredge  developed the theory of  punctuated equilibrium , according to which evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly, alternating with longer periods of relative evolutionary stability. Although Gould coined the term \"punctuated equilibria\" the idea was first presented in Eldredge's doctoral dissertation on  Devonian   trilobite s and in an article published the previous year on  allopatric speciation . According to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar \"in the central logic of  Darwinian theory .\" Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was \"of great interest to biology generally,\" it merely modified  neo-Darwinism  in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before. Other biologists emphasize the theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been \"unexpected by most evolutionary biologists\" and \"had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology.\"\nSome key developments in biology were the discovery of  genetics ;  Darwin's  theory of  evolution  through  natural selection ; the  germ theory of disease  and the application of the techniques of  chemistry  and  physics  at the level of the  cell  or  organic molecule .\nThe 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life  is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous  Vestiges of Creation  had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and  common descent  by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.\nDarwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of  natural selection  and  artificial selection  or  selective breeding .  Genetic drift  was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the  modern synthesis  of the theory.\nCharles Darwin's views on religion have been the subject of much interest. His work which was pivotal in the development of modern  biology  and  evolution  theory played a prominent part in debates about religion and science at the time, then in the early 20th century became a focus of the  creation-evolution controversy  in the United States.\nDarwin's  Theory of Evolution  had a large, yet often understated impact of the articulata hypothesis. Cuvier's original Articulata hypothesis was based on his assumption that current species no longer  evolved  because to evolve would cause loss of integral structures necessary for the survival of the  species . While the general acceptance of the theory of evolution weakened Cuvier's general theory of the unique ground-plans as the origin of modern  taxa , it strengthened the articulata hypothesis by organizing annelids and arthropods into a  clade  descended from a common segmented ancestor.\nWorking at the interface between  physiology ,  evolution  and  design  led Turner to formulate the idea of the Extended Organism, reviewed in a range of journals, including  Nature . Turner's current research focuses on the emergence of super-organismal structure and function in  mound-building termites  of southern Africa (Macrotermes). His extended organism idea was inspired by his work on termite mounds that clarified how the mound functions as an external lung for respiratory gas exchange for the colony as a whole. His prior work on the thermal capacity of incubated birds' eggs showed that an egg with an embryo and an incubating parent function not as two separate organisms but as a coupled physiological unit. Building upon this empirical work, Turner has argued that the principle of homeostasis is a fundamental property of living systems that accounts for, among other things, the phenomenon of biological design. With this argument, Turner counters both  Intelligent Design  and strong  Darwinism , showing how natural selection ( Darwinism ) is complemented by other factors. Turner proposes that modern evolutionary theory over-emphasizes genetic natural selection and a tendency to separate  information  from  catalysis  at the molecular level. By connecting  information  and  catalysis ,  epigenesis  coupled with homeostasis exemplifies the internal, directive capacities of the organism, linking information and behavior. Turner has also suggested that termite mounds exemplify collective intelligence via a form of swarm cognition that is a model for the emergence of cognitive systems in a variety of contexts, including, but not limited to, self-contained nervous systems. The extended organism principle also justifies the  Gaia Hypothesis  and considers what we can translate from micro to macro, whether principles that govern termites offer a perspective on mind. He is an adviser to the Microbes Mind Forum and Professor of Biology at the  State University of New York  College of Environmental Science and Forestry ( SUNY-ESF ) in  Syracuse, New York . Under a grant from the  Templeton Foundation , he has been a visiting scholar at  Cambridge University , writing his third book, currently titled \"Biology's Second Law: Evolution, Purpose and Desire\", which builds the case that evolution operates through the complementary principles of Darwinian  natural selection  (biology\u2019s \"First Law\") coupled to  homeostasis  (biology\u2019s \"Second Law\").\nThe modern evolutionary synthesis is the outcome of a merger of several different scientific fields to produce a more cohesive understanding of evolutionary theory. In the 1920s,  Ronald Fisher ,  J.B.S. Haldane  and  Sewall Wright  combined Darwin's theory of natural selection with statistical models of  Mendelian genetics , founding the discipline of population genetics. In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge population genetics, the observations of field naturalists on the distribution of species and sub species, and analysis of the fossil record into a unified explanatory model. The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as  Theodosius Dobzhansky  and  Ernst Mayr , advanced the understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work  Genetics and the Origin of Species  helped bridge the gap between genetics and field  biology  by presenting the mathematical work of the population geneticists in a form more useful to field biologists, and by showing that wild populations had much more genetic variability with geographically isolated subspecies and reservoirs of genetic diversity in recessive genes than the models of the early population geneticists had allowed for. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr emphasised the importance of subspecies reproductively isolated by geographical barriers in the emergence of new species. The paleontologist  George Gaylord Simpson  helped to incorporate  paleontology  with a statistical analysis of the fossil record that showed a pattern consistent with the branching and non-directional pathway of evolution of organisms predicted by the modern synthesis.\nCharles Darwin  gave new direction to  morphology  and  physiology , by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a  genealogical  basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of  spontaneous generation  and the rise of the  germ theory of disease , though the mechanism of  inheritance  remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of  Mendel's  work led to the rapid development of  genetics  by  Thomas Hunt Morgan  and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of  population genetics  and natural selection in the \" neo-Darwinian synthesis \".\nModern evolutionary theory  continues to develop. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching  common descent , has become the unifying theory of the  life science s. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the  geologic record , biogeography, parallels in  embryo nic development,  biological homologies ,  vestigiality ,  cladistics ,  phylogenetics  and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as  medicine  and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political  controversy  has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.\nIn the early 20th century the  modern evolutionary synthesis  integrated  classical genetics  with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of  population genetics . The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of  biology . Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as  orthogenesis ,  evolutionism , and other beliefs about innate \"progress\" within the  largest-scale trends in evolution , became  obsolete scientific theories . Scientists continue to study various aspects of  evolutionary biology  by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing  mathematical models of theoretical biology  and biological theories, using  observational data , and performing  experiment s in both the  field  and the laboratory.\nGenetics and the Origin of Species provided the outline for a synthesis of genetics with evolution, and was enthusiastically received by both geneticists and naturalists. Dobzhansky laid out an advanced account of the evolutionary process in genetic terms, and he backed up his work with experimental evidence supporting the theoretical arguments. This led to the stimulation of the field of evolutionary genetics, and contributions to the theory soon began to follow. This had a powerful impact on naturalists and experimental biologists, who quickly embraced this new understanding of the evolutionary process as one of genetic change in populations. It was not long before the synthesis was broadened to include paleontology,  systematics  and  botany  in a series of notable books:  Systematics and the Origin of Species  (1942) by  Ernst Mayr ;  Tempo and Mode in Evolution  (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and  Variation and Evolution in Plants  (1950) by  G. Ledyard Stebbins . The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by  Julian Huxley  in his book,  Evolution: The Modern Synthesis . In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete.  Developmental biologists  did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that  molecular biology  bridged the gap. Also, for decades there was disagreement over whether the unit of selection was the gene or the individual as a whole.\nThe Darwin Medal is awarded by the  Royal Society  every alternate year for \"work of acknowledged distinction in the broad area of  biology  in which  Charles Darwin  worked, notably in  evolution ,  population biology , organismal  biology  and  biological diversity \". First awarded in 1890, it was created in memory of  Charles Darwin  and is presented with a \u00a32000 prize (as of 2016).\nThe current theory of evolution, the  modern evolutionary synthesis  (or neo-darwinism), explains that evolution of  species  occurs through a combination of Darwin\u2019s mechanism of natural selection and  Gregor Mendel \u2019s theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance and mathematical population genetics. Essentially, the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries; the units of evolution (genes) with the main mechanism of evolution (selection).\nGlick has worked on various aspects of the impact of Darwin throughout his career. He organized a pioneer conference on the Comparative Reception of Darwinism at the  University of Texas  in 1971, his contribution to which was a study of Spain, which was the first article written on the subject and practically the first study of Spanish biology of the period covered, Spanish research having heretofore concentrated almost exclusively on medicine. A brief comparative survey written around the same time revealed the scant attention paid to either comparative reception studies generally, and of Darwinism in particular. A whole series of studies followed on Darwin\u2019s impact in Spain and Spanish America: on the secondary diffusion of Darwinism in Spain, on Darwinism in Venezuela considered in comparative perspective, on the Cuban reception, on the startlingly prescient writings of Spanish pathologist  Roberto Novoa Santos  on the origins of life and of sex, on the reflection of evolutionary theory in Spanish philology, on  G. G. Simpson \u2019s impact on  Spanish vertebrate paleontology  and  quantitative biology , on the debate over selection among Latin American cattlemen, and a major case study of Uruguay. From Uruguay he turned to evolutionary biology in 20th century Brazil, focusing on  Theodosius Dobzhansky \u2019s role in the establishment of population genetics in that country. In the same period he wrote on the historiography of Darwinism, and with  David Kohn  produced the first anthology of Darwinian texts designed to let reader follow the development of scientific ideas. The key markers in his career as a Darwinian are the Texas conference of 1971, his 1989  Fulbright  lectures in  Uruguay , a 1996 meeting in  Cancun, Mexico , that produced a global reevaluation of Darwinism in the Iberian world, and a volume on Darwinism in Brazil to appear in June 2001. In his  Texas  period he organized an exhibit and edited a catalogue on Darwinism and  Fundamentalism  in Texas  and later wrote an essay on the impact of the  Scopes Trial  in Europe.\nNatural selection relies crucially on the idea of heredity, but developed before the basic concepts of  genetics . Although the  Moravia n monk  Gregor Mendel , the father of modern genetics, was a contemporary of Darwin's, his work lay in obscurity, only being rediscovered in 1900. Only after the mid-20th century integration of evolution with  Mendel's laws  of inheritance, the so-called  modern evolutionary synthesis , did scientists generally come to accept natural selection. The synthesis grew from advances in different fields. Ronald Fisher developed the required mathematical language and wrote  The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection  (1930).  J. B. S. Haldane  introduced the concept of the \"cost\" of natural selection. Sewall Wright  elucidated the nature of selection and adaptation. Theodosius Dobzhansky  established the idea that mutation, by creating genetic diversity, supplied the raw material for natural selection, in his book  Genetics and the Origin of Species  (1937).  Ernst Mayr  recognised the key importance of  reproductive isolation  for speciation in his  Systematics and the Origin of Species  (1942). W. D. Hamilton  conceived of  kin selection  in 1964.This synthesis cemented natural selection as the foundation of evolutionary theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about at the end of the 20th century by  molecular genetics , creating the field of  evolutionary developmental biology  (evo-devo), which seeks to explain evolution at a molecular level.\nRating Newest Oldest.

A REPLICA of the ship that took Charles Darwin on his voyage of discovery could be built by a crew member's descendant. The scientists noted that vines imported from the Americas didn't succumb to the insect, leading a few botanists and vintners to recall the recent writings of Charles Darwin on adaptation.\nHow has Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection influenced scientific thinking in the modern world? The theory of evolution by natural selection, which is the cornerstone of biology, is the basis for immunology, evolutionary biology, ecology, biological anthropology, neurolo \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 gy, evolutionary development and a host of other scientific disciplines.\nBy YourDictionary. Charles Darwin did not invent anything but he discovered a lot as a scientist and naturalist; and, as an author, he impacted science and the way we think about our world. He developed and proposed a theory about evolution. His theory has had far-reaching affects on science and the way we understand life.\nKnow about the impact of Darwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on the evolutionary theory as well as his contribution to biology, botany, geology, psychology and other scientific fields by studying his 10 major accomplishments and achievements. #1 Darwin did important work during H.M.S.

Today biologists can probe the eye and other organs in detail at the molecular level, where they find immensely complex proteins joining together to make structures that bear a striking resemblance to portals, conveyor belts and motors.\nawards and honors. Charles Darwin, in full Charles Robert Darwin (born February 12, 1809, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England\u00e2\u0080\u0094died April 19, 1882, Downe, Kent), English naturalist whose scientific theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern evolutionary studies.\nThese biological concepts, and the theories based on them, cannot be reduced to the laws and theories of the physical sciences. Darwin himself never stated this idea plainly. My assertion of Darwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s importance to modern thought is the result of an analysis of Darwinian theory over the past century. During this period, a pronounced change in the methodology of biology took place.\nDarwin, Charles. English naturalist 1809\u00e2\u0080\u00931882. Charles Darwin was the founder of modern evolutionary thought, and the developer, along with Alfred Russel Wallace, of the theory that natural selection is a principle driving force in evolution.\nModern biology is based on several unifying themes, such as the cell theory, genetics and inheritance, Francis Crick's central dogma of information flow, and Darwin and Wallace's theory of evolution by natural selection. In this first unit we will examine these themes and the nature of science.\nIn the early 20th century the modern evolutionary synthesis integrated classical genetics with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics.

Explanation: Darwin's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection is by far the best explanation for the great diversity of life that we see. Before Darwin's time, science knew that life evolved, since they saw the fossils (fossils were a popular spectacle back then) and their resemblance to extant life.\nDarwin developed a scientific theory of biological evolution that explains how modern organisms evolved over long periods of time through descent from common ancestors. Darwin shares a birthday with what American President. Abraham Lincoln.\nBy Timothy S. Stevens, University Chaplain, Northwestern University. The work of Charles Darwin has implications far beyond science. His revolutionary insights have changed the way we think about society, ethics, and religion. This essay will focus on the impact of evolutionary science on religion, especially its impact on Christian thinking (though much of what is here would apply to the other Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Islam).\nIn the early 20th century the modern evolutionary synthesis integrated classical genetics with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics. The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of biology.\nCharles Darwin. Charles Darwin, widely considered as one of the greatest and most revolutionizing scientists in history, was the British naturalist who formulated the theory of evolution.\nDarwin developed a scientific theory of biological evolution that explains how modern organisms evolved over long periods of time through descent from common ancestors. Darwin was invited to sail on the HMS Beagle's five-year voyage mapping the coastline of South America. Darwin planned to collect specimens of plants and animals on the voyage.\nDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection underlies all modern biology. It enables us to decipher our genes and fight viruses, and to understand Earth's fossil record and rich biodiversity. Simple yet at times controversial, misunderstood and misused for social goals, the theory remains unchallenged as the central concept of biology. Charles Darwin, reluctant revolutionary, profoundly altered our view of the natural world and our place in it. Charles Darwin looked closely at life. The vast and marvelous diversity of life on Earth, from barnacles to butterflies, ostriches to orchids, made him curious.\nExplanation: Darwin's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection is by far the best explanation for the great diversity of life that we see.
