In 1941, Delbr\u00fcck met  Salvador Luria  of  Indiana University  who began visiting Vanderbilt.  In 1942,  Delbr\u00fcck and Luria published  on  bacteria l resistance to  virus  infection mediated by random  mutation.   Alfred Hershey  of  Washington University  began visiting in 1943. The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel\u2019s experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin\u2019s theory was provided when Thomas Morgan Hunt discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin\u2019s ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case).

especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.  Thomas Huxley  would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of  natural selection  as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Henry Fairfield Osborn  preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and  orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.", "qas": [{"id": "question_471", "question": "What did Charles Darwin publish in 1859?", "answers": [{"text": "Charles Darwin's publication of the  ", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_472", "question": "what is On the Origin of Species?", "answers": [{"text": "On the Origin of Species  in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology.", "answer_start": 37}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_473", "question": "What did fossils do?", "answers": [{"text": "Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory.", "answer_start": 144}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_474", "question": "What was Charles Darwin's interest in paleontology?", "answers": [{"text": "In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  ", "answer_start": 209}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_475", "question": "what were some of the fossils that were found?", "answers": [{"text": "South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  ", "answer_start": 277}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_476", "question": "What were the giant llama s related to?", "answers": [{"text": "giant llama s", "answer_start": 403}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_477", "question": "What else did this lead to?", "answers": [{"text": "that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times.", "answer_start": 417}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_478", "question": "What was the first step in the development of evolution?", "answers": [{"text": "The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record.", "answer_start": 501}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_479", "question": "What were the two areas where success attracted considerable public attention?", "answers": [{"text": "There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse.", "answer_start": 695}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_480", "question": "What did Owen find in the 1870's?", "answers": [{"text": "In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen.", "answer_start": 871}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_481", "question": "What was the first thing that was discovered?", "answers": [{"text": "Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881.", "answer_start": 1085}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_482", "question": "What else can you tell me about the research?", "answers": [{"text": "Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872.", "answer_start": 1176}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_483", "question": "What else did he find in the Western United States?", "answers": [{"text": "Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  ", "answer_start": 1255}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_484", "question": "What was the evolutionary background of the horse?", "answers": [{"text": "Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.

Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of  pangenesis.

Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.

De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as  Ronald Fisher,  Sewall Wright  and  J. B. S. Haldane  set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy.

In the 1920s,  Ronald Fisher,  J.B.S. Haldane  and  Sewall Wright  combined Darwin's theory of natural selection with statistical models of  Mendelian genetics, founding the discipline of population genetics. In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge population genetics, the observations of field naturalists on the distribution of species and sub species, and analysis of the fossil record into a unified explanatory model. The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as  Theodosius Dobzhansky  and  Ernst Mayr, advanced the understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work  Genetics and the Origin of Species  helped bridge the gap between genetics and field  biology  by presenting the mathematical work of the population geneticists in a form more useful to field biologists, and by showing that wild populations had much more genetic variability with geographically isolated subspecies and reservoirs of genetic diversity in recessive genes than the models of the early population geneticists had allowed for. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr emphasised the importance of subspecies reproductively isolated by geographical barriers in the emergence of new species.
