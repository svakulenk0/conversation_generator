He further discovered that intermittent fasting is beneficial for health because it imposes a challenge to cells, and those cells respond adaptively by enhancing their ability to cope with stress and resist disease.\nThe 5:2 diet, or fast diet, is a diet which stipulates  calorie restriction  for two non-consecutive days a week and unconstrained eating the other five days. A form of  intermittent fasting , it originated and became popular in the UK, and spread in Europe and to the USA.\nFasting is a willing  abstinence  or reduction from some or all  food ,  drink , or both, for a period of time. An absolute fast (dry fasting) is normally defined as abstinence from all food and liquid for a defined period, usually a period of 24 hours, or a number of days.  Water fasting  allows drinking water but nothing else. Other fasts may be partially restrictive, limiting only particular foods or substances. A fast may also be  intermittent in nature . Fasting practices may preclude intercourse and other activities as well as food.\nA study funded by Isagenix in 2012 by the University of Illinois at Chicago examined the effect of intermittent fasting in combination with a liquid diet consisting of Isagenix Isalean Shakes or a food-based (National Cholesterol Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes) diet. Intermittent fasting in combination with Isalean led to a reduction in fat mass 9% more to that of intermittent fasting in combination with a food-based diet, as well greater reductions in total and LDL cholesterol and several other factors associated with coronary heart disease risk and loss of visceral fat.\nAfter publishing the results of two studies documenting beneficial effects of intermittent fasting in human subjects, one in asthma patients (in collaboration with Dr. James Johnson at LSU Medical Center) and another in women at risk for breast cancer (in collaboration with Dr. Michelle Harvie at the University of Manchester), media coverage of Dr. Mattson\u2019s research led to a  BBC  documentary and a subsequent book by Dr. Michael Mosley which have informed the public throughout Europe and North America of the health benefits of intermittent fasting.   In particular, a diet called the  5:2 diet , based on the studies of Drs. Harvie and Mattson has become widely popular.    A person on the 5:2 diet eats normal amounts of healthy food 5 days each week and eats only one moderate size (500-600 calorie) meal 2 days each week.  For many, this diet has proven easy to implement and maintain.\nA 2014 review described that studies done in animal models have shown fasting improves indicators of health\u2014blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation\u2014likely through adaptive cellular responses to better handle stress. These findings suggest intermittent fasting has the potential to improve health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases; however this has not been reproduced in long-term human studies.  The review also concluded that intermittent fasting has not been studied in children, the elderly, or the underweight, and could be harmful in this population. They also suggest that those choosing to fast for periods of time greater than 24 hours should be monitored by a physician, as changes to the gastrointestinal system or  circadian rhythm  can occur.  The review also concluded that fasting is unlikely to have much effect on conditions other than obesity, such as aging or other chronic condition, unless combined with moderate calorie restriction and plant-based diet such as the Mediterranean diet.\nIn some contexts, fasting allows the consumption of a limited amount of low-calorie beverages such as coffee or tea.

Intermittent fasting can be used along with calorie restriction for weight loss.\nLengthy fasting can be dangerous due to the risk of  malnutrition  and should be carried out only under medical supervision. During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diets the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the  brain , causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of  intermittent fasting  have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent this issue.\nSo is Jimmy Kimmel.
