{"input_text": "Wonder Man debuted in the  superhero -team title  The Avengers  #9 ( cover-date d Oct. 1964), but appeared to die in that issue. Four years later, Avengers #58 (Nov. 1968) revisited the events of #9, explaining that the Avengers had electronically saved Wonder Man's mind in a computer. Wonder Man was not seen again until The Avengers #102 (Aug. 1972), where he made a cameo appearance in a comatose state. Wonder Man's body was revived by the villain  Kang  in The Avengers #131-132 (Jan.\u2013Feb. 1975), and then again by the  Black Talon  in The Avengers #152 (Oct. 1976), and finally by the  Living Laser  in The Avengers Annual #6 (1976). After this last encounter, Wonder Man finally recovered his faculties and joined the Avengers in a full-time capacity in Avengers #160 (June 1977).\n[[File:powermanatlas.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Erik Josten makes his first appearance (where he was known as Power Man). From The Avengers #21 (October 1965). Art by  Jack Kirby .]]Erik Josten was born in  Milwaukee, Wisconsin . A former AWOL Marine turned mercenary, he is employed by  Baron Heinrich Zemo  as head of his South American security/mercenary force.  After Zemo's death, Josten is convinced by the  Enchantress  to undergo the same 'ionic-ray' treatment (from a machine invented by Zemo) as  Simon Williams (Wonder Man) , making Josten super-strong (though not as strong as Wonder Man since the treatment was specifically calibrated to Williams and the Enchantress wasn't aware it had to be tailored to the subject). Taking the name \"Power Man\", he becomes the Enchantress' partner and battles the  Avengers  at her request. She used illusions to turn the city against the Avengers, though finally  Captain America  used a tape recording to prove the Avengers were innocent. He becomes a professional supervillain and partners with the  Swordsman , and the two fight the Avengers again under the leadership of the brainwashed  Black Widow . Alongside the Swordsman, he becomes an unwitting pawn of the  Red Skull 's, and fights Captain America. He briefly serves as an agent of the  Mandarin . He later fights the Avengers again as a member of the first  Lethal Legion .\nAlbert Elwood made a single appearance as the Crimson Avenger, in  World's Finest Comics  #131 (February 1963), in a story entitled \"The Mystery of the Crimson Avenger\". Eccentric inventor Albert Elwood adopted the guise and attempted to help Superman, Batman and Robin thwart the robberies of the Octopus Gang. After the requisite identity confusion when one of the gang members assumed the Crimson Avenger's identity, Elwood did help the heroes capture the gang, and retired right afterward. He had many sophisticated gadgets, but his efforts often proved counterproductive, more a hindrance than a help. He did mention that he had \"taken the name of a former lawman,\" meaning the by-then long defunct original Crimson Avenger. After the introduction of the DC Comics multiverse in the 1960s, the original Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) was explained to have lived on Earth-Two; Albert Elwood's Earth has never been specified.\nWonder Man (Simon Williams) is a  fictional   superhero  appearing in  American comic book s published by  Marvel Comics .
