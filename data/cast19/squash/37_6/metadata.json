{"input_text": "The study of compliance is often recognized for the overt demonstrations of dramatic experiments such as the Stanford prison experiment and the Stanley Milgram shock experiments.  These experiments served as displays of the psychological phenomena of compliance.  Such compliance frequently occurred in response to overt social forces and while these types of studies have provided useful insight into the nature of compliance, today's researchers are inclined to concentrate their efforts on subtle, indirect and/or unconscious social influences.\nStanley Milgram  was one of a number of post-war psychologists and sociologists who tried to address why people obeyed immoral orders in the Holocaust.  Milgram's findings  demonstrated that reasonable people, when instructed by a person in a position of authority,  obeyed  commands entailing what they believed to be the suffering of others. After making his results public, Milgram sparked direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that \"a common psychological process is centrally involved in both [his laboratory experiments and Nazi Germany] events.\" Professor  James Waller , Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at  Keene State College , formerly Chair of  Whitworth College  Psychology Department, expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments do not correspond well to the Holocaust events:\nThe  Milgram experiment  is the name of a 1961 experiment conducted by American psychologist  Stanley Milgram . In the experiment Milgram had an authority figure order research participants to commit a disturbing act of harming another person. After the experiment he would reveal that he had deceived the participants and that they had not hurt anyone, but the research participants were upset at the experience of having participated in the research. The experiment raised broad discussion on the ethics of recruiting participants for research without giving them full information about the nature of the research.\nStanley Milgram (August 15, 1933 \u2013 December 20, 1984) was an American  social psychologist , best known for his controversial  experiment on obedience  conducted in the 1960s during his professorship at  Yale . Milgram was influenced by the events of the  Holocaust , especially the trial of  Adolf Eichmann , in developing the experiment.\nResearch has been conducted unethically in other experiments, not in regard to torture but in cases of consent, deception, privacy, and confidentiality. Such experiments include: the  Milgram Experiment  of 1961 (electric shock treatment),  Humphrey's Tearoom Trade  of 1970 (male on male sexual encounters), and the  Zimbardo Guard Study  of 1971 (college student simulated prison experiment) just to name a few. In these experiments the subjects did not always know what they were getting into or were not all voluntarily participating.\nStanley Milgram's  experiment set out to provide an explanation for the horrors being committed against Jewish individuals trapped in German  concentration camps . The compliance to authority demonstrated by people working in concentration camps ignited the question: \u201cAre Germans actually \u2018evil' or is it possible to make anyone to comply to the orders of an authority figure?\u201d  To test this, Stanley Milgram designed an experiment to see if participants would harm (shock) another individual due to the need to comply with authority.  Milgram developed a pseudo-shock generator with labels beginning at 15 volts (\u201cSlight Shock\u201d) to 450 volts (\u201cXXX\u201d).  Participants took on the role of \u201cteacher\u201d and were informed they would be participating in a learning and memory test.  In doing so, they had to teach the \u201cstudent\u201d (a confederate in a separate room) a list of words.  The \u201cteacher\u201d was instructed to increase the voltage by 15 and shock the \u201cstudent\u201d each time he answered incorrectly.  When a subject began to grow uneasy about shocking the confederate (due to voltage level, noises, ethics, etc.) the experimenter would encourage the participant to continue by proclaiming he would assume full responsibility for any harm done to the \u201cstudent\u201d and by saying phrases such as \u201cIt is absolutely essential that you continue.\u201d  To rule out sadistic tendencies, all 40 \u201cteachers\u201d were male and were screened for competence and intelligence before beginning the experiment.\nIn 1963, Milgram submitted the results of his obedience experiments in the article \"Behavioral Study of Obedience\". In the ensuing controversy, the  American Psychological Association  held up his application for membership for a year because of questions about the ethics of his work, but eventually did grant him full membership. Ten years later, in 1974, Milgram published Obedience to Authority.  He won the  AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research  in 1964, mostly for his work on the social aspects of obedience. Inspired in part by the 1961 trial of  Adolf Eichmann , his models were later also used to explain the 1968  My Lai Massacre  (including authority training in the military, depersonalizing the \"enemy\" through racial and cultural differences, etc.).  He produced a film depicting his experiments, which are considered classics of social psychology.\nThe previous two studies greatly influenced how modern psychologists think about obedience. Milgram's study in particular generated a large response from the psychology community. In a modern study, Jerry Burger replicated Milgram's method with a few alterations. Burger's method was identical to Milgram's except when the shocks reached 150 volts, participants decided whether or not they wanted to continue and then the experiment ended (base condition). To ensure the safety of the participants, Burger added a two-step screening process; this was to rule out any participants that may react negatively to the experiment. In the modeled refusal condition, two confederates were used, where one confederate acted as the learner and the other was the teacher. The teacher stopped after going up to 90 volts, and the participant was asked to continue where the confederate left off.  This methodology was considered more ethical because many of the adverse psychological effects seen in previous studies' participants occurred after moving past 150 volts. Additionally, since Milgram's study only used men, Burger tried to determine if there were differences between genders in his study and randomly assigned equal numbers of men and women to the experimental conditions.\nQuestions have been raised about the  external validity  of deindividuation research. As deindividuation has evolved as a theory, some researchers feel that the theory has lost sight of the dynamic group intergroup context of  collective behavior  that it attempts to model. Some propose that deindividuation effects may actually be a product of group norms; crowd behavior is guided by norms that emerge in a specific context. More generally, it seems odd that while deindividuation theory argues that group immersion causes antinormative behavior, research in  social psychology  has also shown that the presence of a group produces  conformity  to group norms and standards. Certain experiments, such as Milgram\u2019s  obedience  studies (1974) demonstrate conformity to the experimenter\u2019s demands; however the research paradigm in this experiment is very similar to some employ in deindividuation studies, except the role of the experimenter is usually not taken into account in such instances.\nIn his book Irrational Exuberance, Yale finance professor  Robert Shiller  argues that other factors might be partially able to explain the Milgram Experiments:\nMilgram 18  was reproduced to test the participants in a 2008 television special \" The Heist \". Created by  Derren Brown  and  Andy Nyman  for British station  Channel 4 , the Milgram experiment helped determine which candidates were the most responsive to authority. The four most responsive and psychologically sound candidates at the end of the show were indirectly given the opportunity to rob a (fake) armoured bank van.\nThe  Milgram experiment  ran by  Stanley Milgram  provided some of the most stunning insights into how influential  authority  can be over others.\nShe is a  developmental psychologist  at the Institute of Human Development,  University of California, Berkeley . She is known for her research on  parenting styles  and for her critique of  deception in psychological research , especially  Stanley Milgram's controversial experiment .\nDuring World War II, social psychologists studied  persuasion  and  propaganda  for the U.S. military. After the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including  gender  issues and  racial prejudice .  Most notable, revealing, and contentious of these were the  Stanley Milgram shock experiments  on  obedience to authority . In the sixties, there was growing interest in new topics, such as  cognitive dissonance ,  bystander intervention , and  aggression . By the 1970s, however, social psychology in America had reached a crisis. There was heated debate over the ethics of laboratory experimentation, whether or not attitudes really predicted behavior, and how much science could be done in a cultural context. This was also the time when a radical  situationist  approach challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology.\nHumans have been shown to be obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate  authority  figures, as shown by the  Milgram experiment  in the 1960s, which was carried out by Stanley Milgram to find out how the  Nazis  managed to get ordinary people to take part in the mass murders of the  Holocaust . The experiment showed that obedience to authority was the norm, not the exception. Regarding obedience, Milgram said that \"Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to; Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others.\" A similar conclusion was reached in the  Stanford prison experiment .\nThe Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the  research ethics  of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and  inflicted insight  suffered by the participants. In Milgram's defense, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were \"glad\" or \"very glad\" to have participated; 15 percent chose neutral responses (92% of all former participants responding). Many later wrote expressing thanks. Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants. Six years later (at the height of the  Vietnam War ), one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram, explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress:\nGerman philosopher and anthropologist of law Axel Montenbruck wrote that dehumanization is inextricably linked with both the \" techniques of neutralization \" (David Matza/ Gresham Sykes ) and to the obedience aspects of the  Milgram experiment  and in a wider sense with  Philip Zimbardo 's  Stanford prison experiment .\nObedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure. The  Milgram experiment , Zimbardo's  Stanford prison experiment , and the  Hofling hospital experiment  are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience, and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures.\nAccording to  Jonathan Glover 's book Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century, Ridenhour took part in the  Princeton  version of the  Milgram experiment . Ridenhour was part of the minority who refused to administer electric shocks that would result in death. He was the only participant who refused to administer any shocks whatsoever.  Subsequent investigations, however, showed that the Ron Ridenhour who took part in the Milgram experiment and the Ron Ridenhour who helped break the story of the My Lai Massacre are two different individuals.  Glover's source for treating the two individuals as identical came from Gordon Bear, a social psychologist, who on April 5, 2008 posted a correction to the listserv of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology.\nWhile most major controversies about unethical research were focused on biomedical sciences, there were also controversies involving behavioral, psychological, and sociological experiments such as: the  Milgram obedience experiment ,  Stanford prison experiment ,  Tearoom Trade  study, and others. There were also ethical issues related to the  CIA 's  Project MKULTRA .\nSocial Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed. Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence. For example, in Milgram's first set of  obedience experiments , 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer \"maximum shocks\" to a confederate. In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks (two of whom were confederates), once one confederate disobeyed, only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks.\nThe Milgram study found that participants would obey orders even when it posed severe harm to others. This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that \"subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will\".Zimbardo found similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders so much that their behavior turned aggressive. Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards, and because of the psychological duress induced in the experiment, it had to be shut down after only 6 days.\nIn the Milgram and the Zimbardo studies, participants conform to social pressures. Conformity is strengthened by allowing some participants to feel more or less powerful than others. In both experiments, behavior is altered to match the group stereotype.\nLater, Milgram and other psychologists performed variations of the experiment throughout the world, with similar results. Milgram later investigated the effect of the experiment's locale on obedience levels by holding an experiment in an unregistered, backstreet office in a bustling city, as opposed to at Yale, a respectable university. The level of obedience, \"although somewhat reduced, was not significantly lower.\" What made more of a difference was the proximity of the \"learner\" and the experimenter. There were also variations tested involving groups.\nThe other classical study on obedience was conducted at  Stanford University  during the 1970s.  Phillip Zimbardo  was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the  Stanford Prison Experiment , college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of \"social forces\" on participants behavior. Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using  random assignment  half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing \"a psychological state of imprisonment\".\nThis programme also included a re-enactment of the  Milgram experiment  \u2014 originally carried out by  Yale University  psychologist  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s \u2013 with the aim of selecting four of the most obedient of the group. Sixty-five percent of the subjects in this experiment were willing to administer what they believed to be lethal  electric shock s to another person on the instruction of an  authority figure  (unbeknownst to the subjects, no electric shocks were actually administered). These were roughly the same results Milgram himself had observed.\nSome of the guards' behaviour led to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. One third of the guards were judged to have exhibited \"genuine sadistic tendencies\", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized; five of them had to be removed from the experiment early. After Maslach confronted Zimbardo and forced him to realize that he had been passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his supervision, Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become grossly absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as grossly absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment. Ethical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to a  similar experiment , conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at  Yale University  by  Stanley Milgram .\nIn a  Milgram experiment  conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with willingness to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim.\nIn the  Milgram study , a series of experiments begun in 1961, a \"teacher\" and a \"learner\" were placed in two different rooms.  The \"learner\" was attached to an electric harness that could administer shock. The \"teacher\" was told by a supervisor, dressed in a white scientist's coat, to ask the learner questions and punish him when he got a question wrong. The teacher was instructed by the study supervisor to deliver an electric shock from a panel under the teacher's control. After delivery, the teacher had to up the voltage to the next notch. The voltage went up to 450 volts.  The catch to this experiment was that the teacher did not know that the learner was an actor faking the pain sounds he heard and was not actually being harmed. The experiment was being done to see how obedient we are to authority. \"When an authority tells ordinary people it is their job to deliver harm, how much suffering will each subject be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent other person if the instructions come 'from above'?\".  In this study the results show that most teachers were willing to give as much pain as was available to them.  The conclusion was that people are willing to bring pain upon others when they are directed to do so by some authority figure.\nThe Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of  social psychology   experiments  conducted by  Yale University  psychologist  Stanley Milgram . They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to  obey  an  authority figure  who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal  conscience ; the experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of people were prepared to obey, albeit unwillingly, even if apparently causing serious injury and distress. Milgram first described his  research  in 1963 in an article published in the  Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology  and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book,  Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View .\nThose against deception object to the ethical and methodological issues involved in its use. Dresser (1981) notes that, ethically, researchers are only to use subjects in an experiment after the subject has given informed consent. However, because of its very nature, a researcher conducting a deception experiment cannot reveal its true purpose to the subject, thereby making any consent given by a subject misinformed (p. 3).  Baumrind  (1964), criticizing the use of deception in the  Milgram (1963) obedience experiment , argues that deception experiments inappropriately take advantage of the implicit trust and obedience given by the subject when the subject volunteers to participate (p. 421).\nPerhaps most damning to the traditional view of character are the results of the experiments conducted by  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s and  Philip G. Zimbardo  in 1971. In the first of these experiments, the great majority of subjects, when politely though firmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what they thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming \"victim.\" In the second, the infamous  Stanford prison experiment , the planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life had to be ended after only six days because the college students who were assigned to act as guards became sadistic and those who were the \"prisoners\" became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. These and other experiments are taken to show that if humans do have noble tendencies, they are narrow, \"local\" traits that are not unified with other traits into a wider behavioral pattern of being.\nMilgram argued (in  Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View ) that the ethical criticism provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about  human nature . Others have argued that the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment's  methodology . Australian psychologist Gina Perry found an unpublished paper in Milgram's archives that shows Milgram's own concern with how believable the experimental set-up was to subjects involved. Milgram asked his assistant to compile a breakdown of the number of participants who had seen through the experiments. This unpublished analysis indicated that many subjects suspected that the experiment was a  hoax , a finding that casts doubt on the veracity of his results. In the journal  Jewish Currents , Joseph Dimow, a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University, wrote about his early withdrawal as a \"teacher\", suspicious \"that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders, as many Germans had done during the Nazi period.\"\nThe  Milgram experiment  is a well-known example of an experiment with a very high potential for inflicted insight.  Through their participation in the experiment, many subjects realized that they were capable of committing acts of extreme violence on other human beings.  After having this realization, many subjects experienced prolonged symptoms of anxiety.(However, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were \"glad\" or \"very glad\" to have participated.)\nIn 1961, in response to the  Nuremberg Trials , the  Yale   psychologist   Stanley Milgram  performed his \"Obedience to Authority Study\", also known as the  Milgram Experiment , in order to determine if it was possible that the Nazi genocide could have resulted from millions of people who were \"just following orders\". The Milgram Experiment raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants, who were told, as part of the experiment, to apply electric shocks to test subjects (who were actors and did not really receive  electric shocks ).\nThe  Milgram experiment  was a study done in the early 1960s that helped measure a person's moral character. Subjects from different  socio-economic group s were tested on their willingness to press a  buzzer  that caused a participant\u2014 posing as a  subject \u2014 in another room to express great  pain  and distress for giving a wrong answer to a test question. When the subjects raised questions about what they are being asked to do, the  experiment er applied mild pressure in the form of appealing to the need to complete the experiment. The Milgram experiment caused a huge amount of criticism among individuals.  In post-experiment interviews with subjects Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the wrongness of what they were doing. Although the subjects may have had moral values, many were criticized on whether they were a truly moral character.\nWhen the Milgram experimenters were interviewing potential volunteers, the participant selection process itself revealed several factors that affected obedience, outside of the actual experiment.\nSome notable situationist studies include:  Zimbardo 's  Stanford prison experiment ,  bystander  experiments,  obedience  experiments like  Milgram experiment  and heat and  aggression  experiments. The term is popularly associated with  Walter Mischel , although he himself does not appear to like the term.\nIn  The Journal of the American Medical Association ,  Zimbardo's situational perspective received support from other social situational experiments that demonstrated the same idea and concept. Almost ten years prior to the Stanford Prison Experiment (1971),  Stanley Milgram  conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had \"teachers\" that delivered mock electric shocks to the \"learner\" for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20\u201350 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a \"confederate\" that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, \"I advise you to continue with this experiment\" or \"I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks\" and the one that caught most teachers was \"You must continue with the shocks.\" Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.\nHuman subject research legislation in the United States can be traced to the early 20th century.  Human subject research in the United States  was mostly unregulated until the 20th century, as it was throughout the world, until the establishment of various governmental and professional regulations and  codes of ethics . Notable \u2013 and in some cases, notorious \u2013 human subject experiments performed in the US include the  Tuskegee syphilis experiment ,  human radiation experiments , the  Milgram obedience experiment  and  Stanford prison experiment s and  Project MKULTRA . With growing public awareness of such experimentation, and the evolution of professional ethical standards, such research became regulated by various legislation, most notably, those that introduced and then empowered the  institutional review board s.\nParallels can be drawn to the supposed 'group experiment' element of  Big Brother  which Space Cadets draws on, and in wider terms  propaganda ,  subliminal advertising , and the  consensus nature of reality . See also:  Asch conformity experiments ,  Milgram experiment  and the  Stanford prison experiment .\nBurger's first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram's previous study. The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study, showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time. Additionally, Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender.In Burger's follow-up study, he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study. He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue, the more likely they were to stop the experiment.The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results. They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task, over 90% of them completed the experiment.The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies. They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment (called \"the foot in the door scenario\").In addition to the above studies, additional research using participants from different cultures (including Spain, Australia, and Jordan) also found participants to be obedient.\nBehavioral contagion, largely discussed in the behaviors of crowds, and closely related to  emotional contagion , plays a large role in gatherings of two or more people. In the original  Milgram experiment  on  obedience , for example, where participants, who were in a room with only the experimenter, were ordered to administer increasingly more severe electrical shocks as punishment to a person in another room (from here on out, referred to as the \u201cvictim\u201d), the conflict or social restraint experienced by the participants was the obligation to not disobey the experimenter \u2013 even when shocking the victim to the highest shock level given, a behavior which the participants saw as opposing their personal and social ideals (Milgram, 1965, p. 129).\nIn 2001, Haslam collaborated with  Steve Reicher  ( University of St Andrews ) on the  BBC  television programme  The Experiment  (which became known as the \"BBC Prison Study\"). This examined the behaviour of a group of individuals within a simulated prison environment, returning to issues raised by the  Stanford Prison Experiment  (SPE). Amongst other things, the study's findings challenged the role account of tyranny associated with the SPE as well as broader ideas surrounding the \" banality of evil \".  The core insight from the study was that tyranny results from the engaged followership of subordinates rather than blind conformity to roles or rules. Recent work has also demonstrated that the same analysis can explain the behaviour of participants in Milgram's Obedience to Authority experiments.\nIn one classical study, Stanley Milgram (as part of the  Milgram experiment ) created a highly controversial and often replicated study. The experiment involved  deception  of the participants. In the experiment, participants were told they were going to contribute to a study about punishment and learning, but the actual focus was on how long they would listen to and obey orders from the experimenter. The participants were instructed that they had to shock a person in another room for every wrong answer on a learning task, and the shocks increased with intensity for each wrong answer. If participants questioned the procedure, the researcher would encourage them further. The  dependent variable  for this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered.\nMilgram  also conducted two other experiments, replications of his original obedience experiment, with the intent being to analyze the effect of group behavior on participants: instead of the subject being alone with the experimenter, two confederates were utilized.  In the first of the two experiments, \u201cGroups for Disobedience,\u201d the confederates defied the experimenter and refused to punish the victim (p. 130).  This produced a significant effect on the obedience of the participants: in the original experiment, 26 of the 40 participants administered the maximum shock; in the disobedient groups experiment, only 4 of 40 participants administered the highest level of voltage (Table 1).  Despite this high correlation between shock level administered and the obedience of the group in the disobedient groups experiment, there was no significant correlation for the second of the replicated experiments: \u201cObedient Groups\u201d, where the confederates did not disobey the experimenter and, when the participant voiced angst regarding the experiment and wished to stop administering volts to the victim, the confederates voiced their disapproval (p. 133).  Milgram concludes the study by remarking that \u201cthe insertion of group pressure in a direction opposite that of the experimenter\u2019s commands produces a powerful shift toward the group. Changing the group movement does not yield a comparable shift in the [participant\u2019s] performance. The group success in one case and failure in another can be traced directly to the configuration of motive and social forces operative in the starting situation.\u201d That is, if the group\u2019s attitudes are similar to or compatible with the participant\u2019s/observer\u2019s, there is a greater likelihood that the participant/observer will join with the group (p. 134).\nIt describes \u2014 in the form of stories, complete with characters, plot, and emotional insights \u2014 the 10 psychology experiments Slater regards as the most significant or interesting of the 20th century. These include  B.F. Skinner 's work on behaviorism;  Stanley Milgram 's demonstration  of how ordinary people can be influenced to obey authority ;  David Rosenhan 's 1972 experiment in which eight people  feigned mental illness  then gained admittance to psychiatric hospitals;  Harry Harlow 's experiments with  monkeys and motherhood ; and  Bruce K. Alexander 's  Rat Park , where laboratory rats addicted to  morphine  turned the drug down when given a better life.\nThe practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g.,  role-playing ) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the  Milgram experiment  and  Stanford prison experiment ), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.\nOne of the most notable experiments in social psychology was the  Milgram experiment , which studied how far people would go to obey an  authority  figure. Following the events of  The Holocaust  in World War II, the experiment showed that (most) normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer.\nMilgram's obedience experiments came under severe attacks. Some critics argued that the validity of these experiments hinged on the acting ability of the learner and experimenter and that most subjects probably sensed the unreality of the situation. Others questioned the relevance of these artificial laboratory setting to the real world.\nIn 1961,  Yale University  psychologist  Stanley Milgram  led a series of experiments to determine to what extent an individual would obey instructions given by an experimenter. Placed in a room with the experimenter, subjects played the role of a \"teacher\" to a \"learner\" situated in a separate room. The subjects were instructed to administer an electric shock to the learner when the learner answered incorrectly to a set of questions. The intensity of this electric shock was to be increased for every incorrect answer. The learner was a confederate (i.e. actor), and the shocks were faked, but the subjects were led to believe otherwise. Both prerecorded sounds of electric shocks and the confederate's pleas for the punishment to stop were audible to the \"teacher\" throughout the experiment. When the subject raised questions or paused, the experimenter insisted that the experiment should continue. Despite widespread speculation that most participants would not continue to \"shock\" the learner, 65 percent of participants in Milgram's initial trial complied until the end of the experiment, continuing to administer shocks to the confederate with purported intensities of up to \"450 volts\". Although many participants questioned the experimenter and displayed various signs of discomfort, when the experiment was repeated, 65 percent of subjects were willing to obey instructions to administer the shocks through the final one.\nSocial psychologists use experimental methods, both within and outside the laboratory, in an attempt to understand human social interaction. Two widely cited experiments in social psychology experiment are the Stanford prison experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971 and the Milgram obedience experiment by Stanley Milgram.\nStanley Milgram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiment on Obedience is one of my favorites. The results are, no pun intended, very shocking. Stanley Milgram was able to essentially prove that under the right circumstances, good people can do very bad things.\nA confederate is an actor that is part of the experiment and they will know the aim of the study. For example, in the Milgram experiment, there was a confederate who played the part of a person being shocked.\nSituationism > The moral of Milgram's experiment is that behavior is not just a function of personality, but also a function of the situation -- and the latter variable can possess dramatic weight. 1  The bullets directly below detail aspects of Milgram's fabricated environment which made it most persuasive.\n#3 Milgram conducted experiments in which he had a person posing as a 'learner' and another one as a 'researcher'. The experiment was supposed to teach the learner how to spell or something like that.\nMilgram experiment. The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and confederate.\nMilgram's obedience experiment is one of the most famous studies in psychology's history. Learn what it revealed and the moral questions it raised. Milgram's obedience experiment is one of the most famous studies in psychology's history.\nBurger, a professor at Santa Clara University, replicated one of the famous obedience experiments of the late Stanley Milgram, PhD, and found that compliance rates in the replication were only slightly lower than those found by Milgram.\nThe experiments by Stanley Milgram. Stanley Milgram, a psychologist at Yale University, conducted a study focusing on the conflict between obedience to authority and personal conscience. The results of the study were made known in Milgram's Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View (1974).\nStanley Milgram, PhD, was an assistant professor at Yale in 1961 when he conducted the first in a series of experiments in which subjects\u00e2\u0080\u0094thinking they were testing the effect of punishment on learning\u00e2\u0080\u0094administered what they believed were increasingly powerful electric shocks to another person in a separate room.\nMilgram describes 19 variations of the experiment that he conducted in Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View. In general, he found that when the immediacy of the victim was increased, compliance decreased, and when immediacy of the authority increased, compliance increased (Experiments 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934).\nThe Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience.he experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and confederate.\nSocial psychology conducts its experiments both inside and outside of the laboratory. One notable social psychology experiment is the Stanford prison experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, although the extremity of this field experiment is not prototypical of the field.Another notable study is the Stanley Milgram obedience experiment, often known as the Milgram experiment.n the latter half of the 20th century, the phrase experimental psychology had shifted in meaning due to the expansion of psychology as a discipline and the growth in the size and number of its sub-disciplines.\nFor Milgram's other well-known experiment, see Small-world experiment. The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and confederate.he experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and confederate.\nEthical Considerations. In the past, researchers performed all kinds of questionable experiments in the name of science. For example, in one famous experiment, psychologist Stanley Milgram led his subjects to believe that they were giving painful electric shocks to other people. Many people consider this experiment unethical because it caused the subjects emotional discomfort. Today, researchers must abide by basic ethical norms when conducting research.\nOn how Milgram's study coincided with the trial of Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and how the experiment reinforced what Hannah Arendt described as the banality of evil. The Eichmann trial was a televised trial and it did reintroduce the whole idea of the Holocaust to a new American public.\nIn the early 1960s, Stanley Milgram, a social psychologist at Yale, conducted a series of experiments that became famous. Unsuspecting Americans were recruited for what purportedly was an experiment in learning.\nIn other cases, these experiments were also quite controversial. Some of the most famous examples include Milgram's obedience experiment and Zimbardo's prison experiment. Explore some of these classic psychology experiments to learn more about some of the best-known research in psychology history. Pavlov's experiments still stands as one of the most famous in psychology.\nIn 2009, researchers conducted a study designed to replicate Milgram's classic obedience experiment. In an article published in the APS Observer, psychologist Jerry Burger of Santa Clara University and author of the study described how relevant Milgram's study is today:\nStanley Milgram's experiment investigated the effect of authority on people's willingness to do unethical things, stemming from the experiences of the Holocaust.\nMilgram's experiment was unethical for a number of reasons.  Firstly, it used deception, with the participants not being aware  of the true nature of the study. Secondly, it \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 didn't give a clear  right to withdraw: if participants were hesitant, they were  verbally prodded into continuing.\n1 The track We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37) on Peter Gabriel 's 1986 album So is a reference to Milgram's Experiment 18, in which 37 of 40 people were prepared to administer the highest level of shock.\nThe Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram.
