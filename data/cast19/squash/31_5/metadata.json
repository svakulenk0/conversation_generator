{"input_text": "Metastatic tumor of jaws is the most common form of  cancer  involving  bone .  It affects the  mandible  in 61% of cases, the  maxilla  in 24% of cases, and soft tissue in 16% of cases.  In the majority of cases, the tumor originated in the  breast ,  lung ,  kidney ,  colon , or  prostate .  The original tumor usually spreads to the jaws through  Batson's paravertebral plexus .  Teeth can become mobile and  paresthesia  can occur.  On  radiograph s, the  periodontal ligament s appear widened, and the cancer has a moth-eaten appearance.\nMany of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches,  fainting ,  convulsion s, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone,  adrenal gland s, opposite lung, liver,  pericardium , and  kidney s. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.\nCancers in the pancreas may also be  secondary cancer s that have spread from other parts of the body.  This is uncommon, found in only about 2% of cases of pancreatic cancer.  Kidney cancer  is by far the most common cancer to spread to the pancreas, followed by  colorectal cancer , and then cancers of the  skin ,  breast , and  lung .  Surgery may be performed on the pancreas in such cases, whether in hope of a cure or to alleviate symptoms.\nIn January 2014, Mankell announced that he had been diagnosed with  lung cancer  and  throat cancer . In May 2014, he reported that treatments had worked well and he was getting better.\nCancer  can arise in bone tissue, and bones are also a common site for other cancers to spread ( metastasise ) to. Cancers that arise in bone are called \"primary\" cancers, although such cancers are rare. Metastases within bone are \"secondary\" cancers, with the most common being  breast cancer ,  lung cancer ,  prostate cancer ,  thyroid cancer , and  kidney cancer . Secondary cancers that affect bone can either destroy bone (called a \" lytic \" cancer) or create bone (a \" sclerotic \" cancer). Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including  leukemia  and  multiple myeloma . Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body. Cancers in other parts of the body may release  parathyroid hormone  or  parathyroid hormone-related peptide . This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.\nLike any  cancer ,  metastasization  affects many areas of the body, as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and  organ  to organ. For example, if it spreads to the  bone marrow , it will prevent the body from producing enough  red blood cell s and affects the proper functioning of the  white blood cell s and the body's  immune system ; spreading to the  circulatory system  will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer can throw the  nervous system  into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body.\nAfter Raiola began experiencing pain in her throat in March 2015, doctors diagnosed her with strep throat and placed her on antibiotics. When the pain continued, she went to an ear, nose and throat specialist, who detected a tumor and scheduled her for immediate surgery. In April 2015, the tumor and  lymph node s on the left side of her neck were removed during an eight-hour operation. In May 2015, the lymph nodes on the right side of her neck were also removed. Though she was thought to be cancer-free following the surgeries, a throat scan in December revealed that the cancer had returned. It was later revealed that the cancer had spread to her lungs and brain. By January 2016, the tumors no longer responded to the  chemotherapy  and continued to grow. The family was advised that they would need to start  immunotherapy  the following week. Raiola stated during an interview that the cancer was caused by her forty years of smoking. She said, \"If you're smoking, quit now, and if you've never smoked, don't start.\"\nFord died at Eastern Long Island Hospital in  Greenport, Suffolk County, New York  on January 27, 1970 of  lung cancer  and  throat cancer .\nLung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant  lung tumor  characterized by uncontrolled  cell growth  in  tissues  of the  lung . If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of  metastasis  into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most  cancer s that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are  carcinomas . The two main types are  small-cell lung carcinoma  (SCLC) and  non-small-cell lung carcinoma  (NSCLC). The most common  symptom s are coughing (including  coughing up blood ), weight loss, shortness of breath, and  chest pain s.\nEye neoplasms can affect all parts of the  eye , and can be a benign tumor or a malignant tumor ( cancer ). Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or  metastatic cancer  (spread to the eye from another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the eye from another organ are  breast cancer  and  lung cancer . Other less common sites of origin include the  prostate ,  kidney ,  thyroid ,  skin ,  colon  and  blood or bone marrow .\nTreatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has  spread , and the person's  performance status . Common treatments include  palliative care ,  surgery ,  chemotherapy , and  radiation therapy .  Targeted therapy of lung cancer  is growing in importance for advanced lung cancer.\nIf the cancer has spread elsewhere, symptoms related to  metastatic disease  may appear. Common sites of spread include nearby  lymph node s, the  liver ,  lungs  and bone.   Liver metastasis  can cause  jaundice  and abdominal swelling ( ascites ). Lung metastasis can cause, among other symptoms, impaired breathing due to excess fluid around the lungs ( pleural effusion ), and  dyspnea  (the feelings often associated with impaired breathing).\nDuring the filming of  Thunder  in the winter of 1929, Chaney developed  pneumonia . In late 1929 he was diagnosed with bronchial  lung cancer . This was exacerbated when artificial snow, made out of cornflakes, lodged in his throat during filming and quickly created a serious infection.  Despite aggressive treatment, his condition gradually worsened, and seven weeks after the release of the remake of  The Unholy Three , he died of a throat hemorrhage on Tuesday, August 26, 1930 in  Los Angeles, California .\nIn the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the  mouth  and behind the  nose  may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the  lung s and interfering with the person\u2019s ability to  breath e; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to  lung cancer .\nLung cancer is one of the most lethal and common forms of cancer worldwide. Pollution, smoking (active and  passive ),  radiation  (in the form of x-rays or gamma rays) and  asbestos  are risk factors for lung cancer. Symptoms may include persistent cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, fatigue, and swelling of the neck and face. There are different types of lung cancers, which can  metastasize . Treatments include  chemotherapy , surgery, and  radiation . The treatment aimed at killing the cancer can also eliminate functioning lung cells (leukocytes).Specific genetic factors can add to the risk of developing lung cancer. There are regions on chromosomes which are highly susceptible to mutation and, if present, increase the risk of developing lung cancer. These loci are the specific locations of a gene or a DNA sequence on a chromosome. Several loci are associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer.Approximately 26 different genes can mutate into one type of lung cancer, known as carcinoma. An example is the MAP pathway, which is inhibited by ME (a lung cancer treatment). The risk of developing lung cancer is higher for those with a family history of the disease. A second way the risk could go up is if the individual lives with a smoker.\nTreatment of Metastatic Cancer of the Throat. Patients with metastatic cancer of the throat have cancer that has spread to distant sites beyond the throat and neck region. Patients with metastatic cancer are usually treated with systemic combination chemotherapy. However, control of the primary cancer and regional lymph node spread through surgery or radiation is as important as controlling the metastases.\nAbout Lung Cancer. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. A group of lung cancers that are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look under a microscope. The three main types of non-small cell lung cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.on-small cell lung cancer is the most common kind of lung cancer... Read more about Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Small Cell Lung Cancer. An aggressive (fast-growing) cancer that forms in tissues of the lung and can spread to other parts of the body.\nPassive exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) also can cause lung cancer. The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body.\n1 The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body.\nTest for Stage IV Lung Cancer. Despite being spread to the brain, the stage IV lung cancer can spread to the bones, liver, and the adrenal glands. By using normal x-rays, CT scans, bone scans, and blood tests, stage IV cancer diagnosis is done.During the stage IV lung cancer if bone scans are done, then it might disclose the metastases in the bone.est for Stage IV Lung Cancer. Despite being spread to the brain, the stage IV lung cancer can spread to the bones, liver, and the adrenal glands. By using normal x-rays, CT scans, bone scans, and blood tests, stage IV cancer diagnosis is done.\nMouth cancer, also called oral cancer, describes a cancerous tumour, growth or sore developing in the mouth. On the gums. Mouth cancer is related to throat cancer affecting the throat (pharynx). Mouth cancer can be life-threatening if it is not diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Mouth cancer can develop in the mouth itself, called primary oral cancer. It can also spread to the mouth from cancer elsewhere in the body. This is called secondary oral cancer, or metastatic oral cancer.\nStages of non-small cell lung cancer: 1  Stage I non-small cell lung cancer: Cancer may be present in the underlying lung tissues, but the lymph nodes remain unaffected.2  Stage II non-small cell lung cancer: The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or into the chest wall.tages of non-small cell lung cancer: 1  Stage I non-small cell lung cancer: Cancer may be present in the underlying lung tissues, but the lymph nodes remain unaffected.\nThere are two major types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) . Staging lung cancer is based on whether the cancer is local or has spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes or other organs.tage I: The cancer is located only in the lungs and has not spread to any lymph nodes. Stage II: The cancer is in the lung and nearby lymph nodes. Stage III: Cancer is found in the lung and in the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest, also described as locally advanced disease.\n1 The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are the small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). 2  The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke also can cause lung cancer. 2  The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are the small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). 3  The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body.\nIn very bad cases, they can spread into your esophagus and cause: Pain when you swallow or difficulty swallowing; A feeling that food is stuck in your throat or in the middle of your chest; Fever, if the infection spreads beyond the esophagus; The fungus that causes thrush can spread to other parts of the body, like the lungs, liver, and skin. This happens more often in people with cancer, HIV, or other conditions that weaken the immune system.\nLung cancer can start anywhere in the lungs and affect any part of the respiratory system. The cancer cells can spread, or metastasize, to the lymph nodes and other parts of the body. Lung cancers are divided into small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).\nPipes: Pipe smoking causes lung cancer and increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus (9, 15, 16). Hookahs or waterpipes (other names include argileh, ghelyoon, hubble bubble, shisha, boory, goza, and narghile): A hookah is a device used to smoke tobacco.\nAll forms of smoking are linked to these cancers, including cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Tobacco smoke can cause cancer anywhere in the mouth and throat as well as in the lungs, the bladder, and many other organs in the body. Pipe smoking is particularly linked with lesions of the lips, where the pipe comes in direct contact with the tissue.\nSide effects of radiation therapy. Patients with lung cancer who receive radiation therapy often experience fatigue and loss of appetite. If radiation therapy is given to the neck or center of the chest, patients may also develop a sore throat and have difficulty swallowing.hemotherapy is often not as effective as radiation therapy or surgery to treat NSCLC that has spread to the brain. For this reason, NSCLC that has spread to the brain is treated with radiation therapy, surgery, or both. Most patients with brain metastases from NSCLC receive radiation therapy to the entire brain.\n1 Complications of lung cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Complications such as blood clots can lower stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy.  Where your lung cancer has spread - Lung cancer can spread to nearly any region of the body, but most commonly spreads to the brain, the bones, the liver, and the adrenal glands.\nVideo: How cancer spreads. Cancer spreads \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or metastasizes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when cancer cells break away from the original tumor and travel through your bloodstream or lymphatic system to other parts of your body. This video shows how a type of skin cancer called melanoma can metastasize.Although the appearance of cancer cells and the way they spread varies depending on the type of cancer, the general concepts shown here are useful in understanding how any cancer can spread. Keep in mind that not all cancers metastasize.his video shows how a type of skin cancer called melanoma can metastasize. Although the appearance of cancer cells and the way they spread varies depending on the type of cancer, the general concepts shown here are useful in understanding how any cancer can spread.\nSpread to the Brain. Lung cancer is the most common cancer that spreads to the brain, and at least 40 percent of people with advanced lung cancer will develop brain metastases sometime during their disease. Both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer can spread to the brain.\nCancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the lungs, it is called lung cancer. Lung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs also may spread to the lungs. When cancer cells spread from one organ to another, they are called metastases. Lung cancers usually are grouped into two main types called small cell and non-small cell. These types of lung cancer grow differently and are treated differently.\nThere are two major types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) . Staging lung cancer is based on whether the cancer is local or has spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes or other organs.\nWithout running to conclusion, throat and lung cancer can be the cause for the tickle in throat and the persistent coughing. You need to have a professional heath care provider diagnose the condition to be sure the cause is cancer before treatment can commence.\nCigarette smoking is the principal risk factor for development of lung cancer. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) also can cause lung cancer. The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body.\nStage 4 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most advanced form of the disease. In stage IV, the cancer has metastasized, or spread, beyond the lungs into other areas of the body.About 40 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed with lung cancer when they are in stage IV.tage 4 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most advanced form of the disease. In stage IV, the cancer has metastasized, or spread, beyond the lungs into other areas of the body.\nSCLC is more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation... Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are assigned a stage from I to IV in order of severity. 1  In stage I, the cancer is confined to the lung. 2  In stages II and III, the cancer is confined to the lung and, possibly, the lymph nodes.3  Stage IV cancer has spread outside of the lung to other parts of the body.CLC is more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation... Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are assigned a stage from I to IV in order of severity. 1  In stage I, the cancer is confined to the lung. 2  In stages II and III, the cancer is confined to the lung and, possibly, the lymph nodes.\nPassive exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) also can cause lung cancer. The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body. Treatment of lung cancer can involve a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy as well as newer experimental methods.\nA cancer that has spread to another part of the body is called a secondary cancer. The most common areas that lung cancer spreads to are the lymph nodes (in the chest, abdomen, neck or armpit), the liver, the bones and the brain. More rarely lung cancer can spread to the adrenal glands or to other areas of the body. cancer that has spread to another part of the body is called a secondary cancer. The most common areas that lung cancer spreads to are the lymph nodes (in the chest, abdomen, neck or armpit), the liver, the bones and the brain. More rarely lung cancer can spread to the adrenal glands or to other areas of the body.\nThroat cancers may be cured when detected early. If the cancer has spread (metastasized) to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, about half of patients can be cured. If the cancer has spread to parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable. Treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life. After treatment, therapy is needed to help with speech and swallowing.\nSmall cell lung cancer can spread to the brain rapidly, often before the diagnosis of lung cancer is made. When small cell lung cancer has spread to the brain it is classified as extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer can spread to the brain as well, though often later in the disease.\nLung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the U.S. and worldwide. Cigarette smoking is the principal risk factor for development of lung cancer. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) also can cause lung cancer. The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body.\nSelect A Cancer Type. Small cell lung cancer is also called oat cell cancer. About 10%-15% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancers. This type of lung cancer tends to spread quickly.mall cell lung cancer is also called oat cell cancer. About 10%-15% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancers. This type of lung cancer tends to spread quickly.\nSmall cell lung cancer accounts for 10%\u00e2\u0080\u009315% of all lung cancers. It usually starts in the bronchi in the centre of the lungs. Small cell lung cancer is the most aggressive of all types of lung cancer.In many cases, it has spread to other parts of the body by the time it is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer is also known as oat cell carcinoma or small cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Stage is the most important prognostic factor for small cell lung cancer. 2  Limited stage cancers have a much better prognosis than extensive stage cancers. 3  Most people with small cell lung cancer are diagnosed with extensive stage cancer because the cancer spreads early and quickly, before it causes symptoms.\nSmall cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer, which is often referred to as oat cell lung cancer because the cells resemble oats under the microscope, begins in the lung tissue. Unlike most non-small cell lung cancer, it often spreads quickly.mall cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer, which is often referred to as oat cell lung cancer because the cells resemble oats under the microscope, begins in the lung tissue. Unlike most non-small cell lung cancer, it often spreads quickly.\n1 These plants may lodge in the gums or rear of your dog's throat. If that happens, usually a vet's help is needed to remove them.  Lung cancer Coughing can be a symptom of this type of cancer, but it is rare in dogs. Nevertheless, it is good to have your veterinarian rule it out as a possibility. Canine lung cancer frequently will metastasize, or spread, from a tumor elsewhere in the body.\nWhat Are Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Cancers? Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers start in the lower part of the throat. Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer?\nWhen cancer spreads to lymph nodes, the cancer cells in the nodes will look like cells from the primary tumour when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re examined under the microscope. For example, when a lung cancer | has spread to the lymph nodes, the cells in the lymph nodes look like lung cancer cells.This affects the way they are treated.hen cancer spreads to lymph nodes, the cancer cells in the nodes will look like cells from the primary tumour when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re examined under the microscope. For example, when a lung cancer | has spread to the lymph nodes, the cells in the lymph nodes look like lung cancer cells.\nCancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the lungs, it is called lung cancer. Lung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs also may spread to the lungs.When cancer cells spread from one organ to another, they are called metastases.ung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs also may spread to the lungs.\nIn fact, some people diagnosed with throat cancer are diagnosed with esophageal, lung, or bladder cancer at the same time. This is typically because cancers often have the same risk factors, or because cancer that begins in one part of the body can spread throughout the body in time.\nDepending upon the extent of spread of the cancer, other symptoms can include swelling of nearby tissues, enlarged lymph nodes, trouble breathing, difficulty speaking, neck or throat pain, ear pain, painful swallowing, and headache.Pain or ringing in the ears may occur in some cases.edical Author: Melissa Conrad Stoeppler, ST\u00c3\u00b6PPLER. Md throat cancers may not cause any symptoms if they are very small and have not spread at the time of. Diagnosis, sometimes an area of irritation or discoloration on the lining issues of the throat is the only sign of an. abnormality\nThere two main types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These categories refer to what the cancer cells look like under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer. Staging. If lung cancer is diagnosed, other tests are done to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This process is called staging. The type and stage of lung cancer tells doctors what kind of treatment you need. For more information, visit Stages of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Stages of Small Cell Lung Cancer. Types of Treatment. Lung cancer is treated in several ways, depending on the type of lung cancer and how far it has spread. People with non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. People with small cell lung cancer are usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Surgery. An operation where doctors cut out cancer tissue. Chemotherapy. Using special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. The drugs can be pills you take or medicines given in your veins, or sometimes both. Radiation therapy. Using high-energy rays (similar to X-rays) to kill the cancer. Targeted therapy.\nMost of the time, the spread of lung cancer to the lymph nodes doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause any symptoms. When these cancers extend to lymph nodes beyond the lungs, you may notice a lump in your neck or your armpit, similar (but usually firmer) to the swollen glands you may have had in the past with a sore throat.\nTypes and Staging of Lung Cancer. There are two major types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Staging lung cancer is based on whether the cancer is local or has spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes or other organs.\nSymptoms of metastatic lung tumors depend on the location and size. About 30% to 40% of people with lung cancer have some symptoms or signs of metastatic disease. Lung cancer most often spreads to the liver, the adrenal glands, the bones, and the brain. Metastatic lung cancer in the liver may cause a loss of appetite, feeling full early on while eating, and otherwise unexplained weight loss. Metastatic lung cancer in the adrenal glands also typically causes no symptoms.\nWhat can you expect if your lung cancer has spread to your liver? Overview. Lung cancer that has spread to the liver is called \u00e2\u0080\u009clung cancer metastatic to the liver\u00e2\u0080\u009d (in contrast to metastatic liver cancer, which would refer to cancer that began in the liver and spreads to another region of the body). For people with non-small cell lung cancer, the spread of cancer to the liver would classify it as a stage 4 cancer. With small cell lung cancer, it would be classified as an extensive stage. Lung cancer can spread to any region of the body, but most commonly spreads to the liver, the lymph nodes, the brain, the bones, and the adrenal glands. Oftentimes, lung cancer will spread to more than one area of the body.\nFor example: 1  Breast cancer may spread to the lymph glands in the armpit. 2  Throat cancer may spread to lymph glands in the neck. 3  Lung and stomach cancers may spread to lymph glands that you usually cannot see or feel in the chest and abdomen. 4  Skin cancers may spread first to the closest lymph glands to the area of skin involved.", "key": "31_5", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:58.959887", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
