{"input_text": "\"Blood-induced icterus\" produced by the release of massive amounts of a coloring material from blood cells followed by the formation of bile was recognized and described by Vanlair and Masius' in 1871. About 20 years later, Hayem distinguished between congenital hemolytic anemia and an acquired type of infectious icterus associated with chronic splenomegaly. In 1904, Donath and Landsteiner suggested a serum factor was responsible for hemolysis in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. French investigators led by Chauffard stressed the importance of red-cell  autoagglutination  in patients with acquired hemolytic anemia. In 1930, Lederer and Brill described cases of acute  hemolysis  with rapid onset of anemia and rapid recovery after transfusion therapy. These hemolytic episodes were thought to be due to infectious agents. A clear distinction between congenital and acquired hemolytic anemia was not drawn, however, until Dameshek and Schwartz in 1938, and, in 1940, they demonstrated the presence of abnormal hemolysins in the sera of patients with acquired  hemolytic anemia  and postulated an  immune mechanism .\nAnemia  in cancer patients can be a combined outcome caused by myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and possible cancer-related causes such as  bleeding ,  blood cell  destruction ( hemolysis ), hereditary disease, kidney dysfunction, nutritionaldeficiencies and/or  anemia of chronic disease . Treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production ( erythropoietin ),  iron supplement s, and  blood transfusion s. Myelosuppressive therapy can cause a tendency to bleed easily, leading to anemia. Medications that kill rapidly dividing cells or blood cells can reduce the number of  platelet s in the blood, which can result in  bruises  and  bleeding . Extremely low platelet counts may be temporarily boosted through  platelet transfusion s and new drugs to increase platelet counts during chemotherapy are being developed. Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed to allow platelet counts to recover.\nThe first report associating it with megaloblastic anemia came in 1954 from Drs. Chalmers and Boheimer.  Between 1954 and 1957, twenty-one cases of megaloblastic anemia associated with primidone and/or phenytoin were reported. Most cases were due to folic acid deficiency; however, there was one that only responded to B therapy and one that required Vitamin C. Some cases were associated with deficient diets; one patient ate mostly bread and butter, another ate bread, buns, and hard candy, and another could rarely be persuaded to eat in the hospital. The idea that folic acid deficiency could cause megaloblastic anemia was not new. What was new was the idea that drugs could cause this in well-nourished people with no intestinal abnormalities. In many cases, it was not clear which drug had caused it. It was speculated that this might be related to the structural similarity between folic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone. Folic acid had been found to alleviate the symptoms of megaloblastic anemia in the 1940s, not long after it was discovered, but the typical patient only made a full recovery\u2014cessation of CNS and  PNS  symptoms as well as anemia\u2014on B therapy. Five years earlier, folic acid deficiency was linked to birth defects in rats. Primidone was seen by some as too valuable to withhold based on the slight possibility of this rare side effect and by others as dangerous enough to be withheld unless phenobarbital or some other barbiturate failed to work for this and other reasons (i.e., reports of permanent psychosis.\nMacrocytic anemia can be further divided into \"megaloblastic anemia\" or \"nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia\". The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells. The megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes). The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e. unimpaired DNA globin synthesis,) which occur, for example, in alcoholism.In addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B deficiency include  peripheral neuropathy  and  subacute combined degeneration of the cord  with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology. Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and  glossitis .The treatment for vitamin B-deficient anemia was first devised by  William Murphy , who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease.  George Minot  and  George Whipple  then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the  vitamin B  from the liver. All three shared the 1934  Nobel Prize in Medicine .\nAnemia  is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure. The treatment of anemia significantly improves quality of life for those with heart failure, often with a reduction in severity of the NYHA classification, and also improves mortality rates. The latest European guidelines (2012) recommend screening for iron-deficient anemia and treating with  parenteral iron  if anemia is found.\nDefinition. Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a condition in which blood lacks adequate healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues.As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin).As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath. You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation.ithout enough iron, your body can't produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin). As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath. You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation.\nVitamin deficiency anemia can occur if you don't eat enough folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin C. Or vitamin deficiency anemia can occur if your body has trouble absorbing or processing these vitamins. Not all anemias are caused by a vitamin deficiency. Other causes include iron deficiency and certain blood diseases.That's why it's important to have your doctor diagnose and treat your anemia. Vitamin deficiency anemia can usually be corrected with vitamin supplements and changes to your diet.1  Symptoms.ther causes include iron deficiency and certain blood diseases. That's why it's important to have your doctor diagnose and treat your anemia. Vitamin deficiency anemia can usually be corrected with vitamin supplements and changes to your diet. 1  Symptoms.\nOverview. Red blood cells are important for the transport of oxygen-rich blood to body tissues and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Red blood cells are red because they contain an iron-rich protein known as hemoglobin, which is bright red in color. Over time, red blood cells wear out and die.The bone marrow continually makes more red blood cells. Certain foods increase production of red blood cells.olic Acid-Rich Foods. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is a B-complex vitamin that helps the body make new healthy red blood cells. Patients with low levels of folic acid often develop anemia. Patients can increase red blood cells in the body by consuming foods rich in folic acid.\nUsually, people can eliminate iron deficiency anemia by taking iron as pills and adding iron in their diet. If your anemia is not corrected with these treatments, your doctor might do more testing to look for other causes of your anemia, such as new bleeding or difficulty absorbing iron from pills.f your anemia is caused by: 1  A disease or condition, such as bleeding in your stomach, your doctor will take steps to correct the problem. 2  Not having enough iron in your diet or not being able to absorb iron, your doctor will work with you to develop a plan to increase your iron levels.\nAnemia occurs when the amount of hemoglobin in a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood is too low. This means there is not enough delivery of oxygen to the body. This can cause paleness, tiredness or fatigue, and weakness. Anemia can last a short time or a long time. In mild cases, treatment is a simple change in diet.", "key": "67_7", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.235669", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
