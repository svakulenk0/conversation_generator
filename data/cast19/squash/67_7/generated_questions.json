anemia\". The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells. The megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes). The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e. unimpaired DNA globin synthesis,) which occur, for example, in alcoholism.In addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B deficiency include  peripheral neuropathy  and  subacute combined degeneration of the cord  with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology. Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and  glossitis.The treatment for vitamin B-deficient anemia was first devised by  William Murphy, who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease.  George Minot  and  George Whipple  then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the  vitamin B  from the liver. All three shared the 1934  Nobel Prize in Medicine.", "qas": [{"id": "question_85", "question": "What is anemia?", "answers": [{"text": "Macrocytic anemia can be further divided into \"megaloblastic anemia\" or \"nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia\".", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_86", "question": "What is the cause of megaloblastic anemia?", "answers": [{"text": "The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells.", "answer_start": 110}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_87", "question": "What is the  megaloblastic anemias?", "answers": [{"text": "The megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes).", "answer_start": 281}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_88", "question": "What are the symptoms of anemia?", "answers": [{"text": "The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e. unimpaired DNA globin synthesis,) which occur, for example, in alcoholism.", "answer_start": 374}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_89", "question": "What else can you tell me about vitamin B deficiency?", "answers": [{"text": "In addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B deficiency include  peripheral neuropathy  and  subacute combined degeneration of the cord  with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology.", "answer_start": 520}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_90", "question": "What else can you tell me about vitamin B deficiency?", "answers": [{"text": "Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and  glossitis.The treatment for vitamin B-deficient anemia was first devised by  ", "answer_start": 775}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_91", "question": "What did he do to cure it?", "answers": [{"text": "William Murphy, who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again.", "answer_start": 905}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_92", "question": "What did George Minot discover?", "answers": [{"text": "He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease.
