An overarching evolutionary theory which can provide an explanation for the above mechanisms and strategies adopted by individuals which leads to age disparity in relationships is called  Life History theory  which also includes  Parental Investment  Theory.

Parental Investment Theory  refers to the value that is placed on a potential mate based on reproductive potential and reproductive investment. The theory predicts that preferred mate choices have evolved to focus on reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex. This theory predicts both intrasexual selection and intersexual choice due to differences in parental investment; typically there is  competition  among members of the lower investing sex (generally males) over the parental investment of the higher investing sex (generally females) who will be more selective in their mate choice. However, human males tend to have more parental investment compared to mammal males (although females still tend have more parental investment). Thus, both sexes will have to compete and be selective in mate choices. These two theories explain why natural and sexual selection acts slightly differently on the two sexes so that they display different preferences.

This theory has many components related to systemic effects in  sex ratio s, shapes of phenotypic distributions in male and female phenotypes,  sex dimorphism,  mutation rate s in genotypes, sex differences in  birth ratio s,  mortality rates, and in susceptibility to new diseases.Geodakyan started working on the theory in 1965. Two main hypotheses of this theory that complement each other are: the principle of conjugated subsystems and the theory of asynchronous evolution. These hypotheses relate to the paradox of  sexual reproduction   and suggest an explanation of why sexual reproduction became the most common way of reproduction among three types of reproduction known in biology:  asexual,  hermaphrodite  reproduction and  sexual reproduction. The paradox of sexual reproduction (discussed more on the page  evolution of sexual reproduction ) notes that  Hermaphrodite  reproduction gives the highest diversity of configurations and an easier mating process than bi-sexual reproduction (such as in humans, when half of the members (males) can\u2019t reproduce and can only diversify the genes). Since in bi-sexual reproduction members of species can mate only with the opposite sex, there are fewer opportunities for mating and a lower diversity of outcome of their gene recombinations, in comparison to hermaphrodites. Meanwhile bisexual species still have to share food and other resources with members who don\u2019t reproduce (males). In spite of these disadvantages of bi-sexual reproduction, paradoxically, most plants and animals shifted from  hermaphroditism  and  gonochorism  to  sexual dimorphism. Why? (Figure 1).
