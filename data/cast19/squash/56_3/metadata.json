{"input_text": "In the mid-19th century,  Charles Darwin  formulated the  scientific theory  of evolution by  natural selection , published in his book  On the Origin of Species  (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three  fact s about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour ( phenotypic variation ), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and  reproduction  (differential  fitness ), and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation ( heritability  of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by  progeny  of parents better  adapted  to survive and reproduce in the  biophysical environment  in which natural selection takes place. This  teleonomy  is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are  seemingly fitted  for the  functional  roles they perform. Natural selection, including  sexual selection , is the only known cause of adaptation but not the only known cause of evolution. Other, nonadaptive evolutionary processes include  mutation ,  genetic drift  and  gene migration .\nThe  evolution of sexual reproduction  as well as its maintenance, is another mystery in biology. The purpose of  sexual reproduction  is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (\ufb01tness disadvantage) in relation to  asexual reproduction .  Mating type s (types of  gamete s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of  anisogamy  (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy. It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary  mating system , and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism.  Charles Darwin  was the first to suggest that  sexual selection  drives  speciation  (the formation of  species ); without sexual reproduction it is unlikely that complex life would have evolved.\nEvolutionary psychologists   Martin Daly  and  Margo Wilson  propose that the Cinderella effect is a direct consequence of the  modern evolutionary  theory of  inclusive fitness , especially  parental investment theory . They argue that human child rearing is so prolonged and costly that \"a parental psychology shaped by natural selection is unlikely to be indiscriminate\". According to them, \"research concerning animal social behaviour provide a rationale for expecting parents to be discriminative in their care and affection, and more specifically, to discriminate in favour of their own young\". Inclusive fitness theory proposes a selective criterion for the evolution of social traits, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism can nevertheless emerge when there is a statistical likelihood that significant benefits of that social behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait (most straightforwardly, accrue to close genetic relatives). Under such conditions, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result.\nThe evolution of sexual reproduction describes how  sexually reproducing   animal s,  plant s,  fungi  and  protist s  evolved  from a  common ancestor  that was a single celled  eukaryotic   species . There are a few species which have secondarily lost the ability to reproduce sexually, such as  Bdelloidea , and some plants and animals that routinely reproduce asexually (by  apomixis  and  parthenogenesis ) without entirely losing sex. The evolution of  sex  contains two related, yet distinct, themes: its origin and its maintenance.\nMost  eukaryotes   species use  sexual reproduction , the division into two sexes is a dimorphism. The question of   evolution of sex  from asexual reproduction has engaged the attentions of biologists such as  Charles Darwin ,  August Weismann , Ronald Fisher,  George C. Williams , John Maynard Smith and  W. D. Hamilton , with varied success.\nBy mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that \"one species does change into another\" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange  Macrauchenia , which resembled a giant  guanaco . His thoughts on lifespan,  asexual reproduction  and  sexual reproduction  developed in his \"B\" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring \"to adapt & alter the race to changing world\" explaining the  Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise s, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a  genealogical  branching of a single  evolutionary tree , in which \"It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another\", discarding  Lamarck 's independent  lineages  progressing to higher forms.\nSexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it.  George C. Williams  used  lottery  tickets as an  analogy  in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction. He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of \"winning\" - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.\nThe evolutionary approach, based on the theories of  Charles Darwin  attempts to explain age disparity in  sexual relationships in terms of  natural selection  and  sexual selection . Within sexual selection  Darwin  identified a further two mechanisms which are important factors in the evolution of sex differences ( sexual dimorphism ):  intrasexual selection  (involve competition with those of the same sex over access to mates) and  intersexual choice  (discriminative choice of mating partners). An overarching evolutionary theory which can provide an explanation for the above mechanisms and strategies adopted by individuals which leads to age disparity in relationships is called  Life History theory  which also includes  Parental Investment  Theory.  Life History theory  posits that individuals have to divide energy and resources between activities (as energy and resources devoted to one task cannot be used for another task) and this is shaped by  natural selection .  Parental Investment Theory  refers to the value that is placed on a potential mate based on reproductive potential and reproductive investment. The theory predicts that preferred mate choices have evolved to focus on reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex. This theory predicts both intrasexual selection and intersexual choice due to differences in parental investment; typically there is  competition  among members of the lower investing sex (generally males) over the parental investment of the higher investing sex (generally females) who will be more selective in their mate choice. However, human males tend to have more parental investment compared to mammal males (although females still tend have more parental investment). Thus, both sexes will have to compete and be selective in mate choices. These two theories explain why natural and sexual selection acts slightly differently on the two sexes so that they display different preferences. For example, different age preferences may be a result of sex differences in mate values assigned to the opposite sex at those ages.\nAs the snails can reproduce both sexually and asexually, the snail has been used as a model organism for studying the costs and benefits of sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction allows all members of a population to produce offspring and avoids the costs involved in finding mates. However, asexual offspring are  clonal , so lack variation. This makes them susceptible to parasites, as the entire clonal population has the same resistance mechanisms. Once a strain of parasite has overcome these mechanisms, it is able to infect any member of the population. Sexual reproduction mixes up resistance genes through  crossing over  and the random assortment of gametes in  meiosis , meaning the members of a sexual population will all have subtly different combinations of resistance genes. This variation in resistance genes means no one parasite strain is able to sweep through the whole population. New Zealand mudsnails are commonly infected with  trematode  parasites, which are particularly abundant in shallow water, but scarce in deeper water. As predicted, sexual reproduction dominates in shallow water, due to its advantages in parasite resistance. Asexual reproduction is dominant in the deeper water of lakes, as the scarcity of parasites means that the advantages of resistance are outweighed by the costs of sexual reproduction.\nThe  Red Queen hypothesis  suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against  parasite s, because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical  clone s than those of sexual species that present moving targets, and there is some experimental evidence for this. However, there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present, as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out-breed the sexual species. Furthermore, contrary to the expectations of the Red Queen hypothesis, Kathryn A. Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. In addition, biologist Matthew Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in the host.\nDarwin's pangenesis theory was complex as he tried to explain the process of  sexual reproduction , passing of traits and complex  developmental  phenomena, such as cellular  regeneration .\nFrom this theory, Roughgarden concludes that the main benefit of sexual reproduction is the maintenance of genetic diversity when compared to similar asexual populations.\nSex . This chapter is a discussion of theories of the  evolution of sexual reproduction . The common-sense explanation is that although  asexual reproduction  is much easier and more efficient for an organism it is less common than sexual reproduction because having two parents allows species to adapt and evolve more easily to survive in changing environments. Brooks discusses efforts to prove this by laboratory experiment and goes on to discuss alternative theories including the work of  Joan Roughgarden  of  Stanford University  who proposes that sexual reproduction, rather than being driven by  Charles Darwin 's  sexual selection  in individuals is a mechanism for the survival of social groupings, which most higher species depend on for survival.\nSome species reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis (such as the  Bdelloid rotifers ), while others can switch between sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis. This is called facultative parthenogenesis (other terms are cyclical parthenogenesis, heterogamy or heterogony). The switch between sexuality and parthenogenesis in such species may be triggered by the season ( aphid , some  gall wasps ), or by a lack of males or by conditions that favour rapid population growth ( rotifers  and  cladocerans  like  daphnia ). In these species asexual reproduction occurs either in summer (aphids) or as long as conditions are favourable. This is because in asexual reproduction a successful genotype can spread quickly without being modified by sex or wasting resources on male offspring who won't give birth. In times of stress, offspring produced by sexual reproduction may be fitter as they have new, possibly beneficial gene combinations. In addition, sexual reproduction provides the benefit of meiotic recombination between non-sister chromosomes, a process associated with repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other DNA damages that may be induced by stressful conditions. (See also  Meiosis  section: Origin and function of meiosis.)\nMore heritable phenotypic variation means more evolvability. While mutation is the ultimate source of heritable variation, its permutations and combinations also make a big difference. Sexual reproduction generates more variation (and thereby evolvability) relative to asexual reproduction (see  evolution of sexual reproduction ). Evolvability is further increased by generating more variation when an organism is stressed, and thus likely to be less well adapted, but less variation when an organism is doing well. The amount of variation generated can be adjusted in many different ways, for example via the  mutation rate , via the probability of  sexual  vs.  asexual reproduction , via the probability of  outcrossing  vs.  inbreeding , via  dispersal , and via access to previously cryptic variants through the switching of an  evolutionary capacitor . A large population size increases the influx of novel mutations each generation.\nThe primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.  Bacteria  and  archaea  exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g.,  Cryptophyta ,  Choanoflagellata , many   Euglenozoa , many  Amoebozoa , some red algae, some  green algae , the  imperfect fungi , some  rotifer s and many other groups, not necessarily haploid). However, these eukaryotes probably are not primitively asexual, but have lost their sexual reproduction, or it just was not observed yet. Many eukaryotes (including animals and plants) exhibit  asexual reproduction , which may be facultative or obligate in the life cycle, with sexual reproduction occurring more or less frequently.\nGeodakyan Evolutionary Theory of Sex theory (ETS) (ETS) was proposed by Vigen Geodakyan in 1960-80s. This theory has many components related to systemic effects in  sex ratio s, shapes of phenotypic distributions in male and female phenotypes,  sex dimorphism ,  mutation rate s in genotypes, sex differences in  birth ratio s,  mortality rates , and in susceptibility to new diseases.Geodakyan started working on the theory in 1965. Two main hypotheses of this theory that complement each other are: the principle of conjugated subsystems and the theory of asynchronous evolution. These hypotheses relate to the paradox of  sexual reproduction   and suggest an explanation of why sexual reproduction became the most common way of reproduction among three types of reproduction known in biology:  asexual ,  hermaphrodite  reproduction and  sexual reproduction . The paradox of sexual reproduction (discussed more on the page  evolution of sexual reproduction ) notes that  Hermaphrodite  reproduction gives the highest diversity of configurations and an easier mating process than bi-sexual reproduction (such as in humans, when half of the members (males) can\u2019t reproduce and can only diversify the genes). Since in bi-sexual reproduction members of species can mate only with the opposite sex, there are fewer opportunities for mating and a lower diversity of outcome of their gene recombinations, in comparison to hermaphrodites. Meanwhile bisexual species still have to share food and other resources with members who don\u2019t reproduce (males). In spite of these disadvantages of bi-sexual reproduction, paradoxically, most plants and animals shifted from  hermaphroditism  and  gonochorism  to  sexual dimorphism . Why? (Figure 1). (for comparison of types of reproduction see the review: In 2001, Vladimir Iskrin began refining and expanding on Geodakyan's theory.\nThe author, in an appendix to the novel, explains that the idea for the society in which the story takes place originated from a study of  reproductive cycle of aphids , which is  heterogamous .  Aphids alternate between  asexual reproduction  in the Summer, i.e., when the environment is favorable and there is plenty of food, and sexually in the Fall when the organism is stressed by its environment.  This has the biological advantage of ensuring identical copies of the parent will be well suited to take advantage of the favorable conditions, and variation in offspring in a stressful environment in hopes some of the offspring will find the environment favorable, even when the parents do not.  The entire social construct in the novel is therefore an extrapolation of this idea onto a human culture, where successful female clans (female, because only they can produce offspring) can take advantage of their sociological niches by producing exact copies, and unsuccessful females produce variable offspring sexually.  One could argue that successful human organizations such as the clans require a variety of personality types and individuals of complementary skill sets to be successful as an organization.  While this criticism is not directly addressed, it might act as a limiter on how large a particular clan could grow, since inevitably a large organizational structure would require specialization of tasks for which none of the clan members may be suited.\nThe parasite/host relationship probably drove the prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords a better chance of developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction viability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite.\nWhen food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see  Meiosis  and Bernstein et al.). In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other \"over-wintering\" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can \"wait out\" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.\nFurther evidence was observed of the Red Queen to see allelic affects under sexual selection. The Red Queen Hypothesis leads to the understanding that allelic recombination is advantageous for populations that engage in aggressive biotic interactions, such as predator-host interactions. In cases of predator-host relations, sexual reproduction can quicken the production of new multi-locus genotypes allowing the host to escape invasion by parasites that have adapted to the prior generations of typical hosts. Mutational effects can be represented by models to describe how recombination through sexual reproduction can be advantageous. According to the mutational deterministic hypothesis, if the deleterious mutation rate is high, and if those mutations interact to cause a general decline in organismal fitness, then sexual reproduction provides an advantage over asexually reproducing organisms by allowing populations to eliminate the deleterious mutations not only more rapidly, but also most effectively. Recombination is one of the fundamental means that explain why many organisms have evolved to reproduce sexually.\nWhile all  prokaryote s reproduce asexually (without the formation and fusion of gametes), mechanisms for  lateral gene transfer  such as  conjugation ,  transformation  and  transduction  are sometimes likened to  sexual reproduction  (or at least with  sex , in the sense of  genetic recombination  in  meiosis . A complete lack of sexual reproduction is relatively rare among multicellular organisms, particularly animals. It is not entirely understood why the ability to reproduce sexually is so common among them. Current hypotheses suggest that asexual reproduction may have short term benefits when rapid population growth is important or in stable environments, while sexual reproduction offers a net advantage by allowing more rapid generation of genetic diversity, allowing adaptation to changing environments. Developmental constraints may underlie why few animals have relinquished sexual reproduction completely in their life-cycles. Another constraint on switching from sexual to asexual reproduction would be the concomitant loss of meiosis and the protective recombinational repair of DNA damage afforded as one function of meiosis.\nWith  asexual reproduction , it is sufficient to assign fitnesses to genotypes. With  sexual reproduction , genotypes are scrambled every generation. In this case, fitness values can be assigned to  allele s by averaging over possible genetic backgrounds. Natural selection tends to make  allele s with higher fitness more common over time, resulting in  Darwinian  evolution.\nSupporters of these theories respond to the balance argument that the individuals produced by sexual and asexual reproduction may differ in other respects too \u2013 which may influence the persistence of sexuality. For example, in the  heterogamous   water flea s of the genus Cladocera, sexual offspring form eggs which are better able to survive the winter versus those the fleas produce asexually.\nGenetic variation and diversity in a species is a good advantage. Asexual reproduction essentially clones itself. If something can kill one, it can kill them all. In sexual re \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 production, there are many different sets of genes so what kills some may not kill all.ecause mutations in non-reproductive cells (aka somatic cells) are not heritable and therefore die with the individual in which they occurred. Only mutations that affect repr \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 oductive cells (aka germ cells) are inherited by progeny and influence the genetic variation of a population over time.\n1) sexual reproduction causes diversity in a species by sharing half of the offsprings genes from each parent. Which aids in the prevention of the spread of deadly diseases. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 2) in asexual reproduction all genes from the parent are given to the offspring. No diversity.\nAsexual reproduction allows an organism to reproduce without a mate. It is an advantage when organisms are few and far between. Sexual reproduction gives a huge advantage under normal circumstances in that the process of evolution runs much faster. Asexual reproduction allows an organism to reproduce without a mate.\nRating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Sexual reproduction allows traits that are adaptive/beneficial to spread through a population and species fairly quickly. It also allows 2 or more beneficial traits that have evolved independently in 2 or more individuals to be passed along to the same descendants.exual reproduction also promotes genetic diversity, so that a population is less susceptible in case of disease epidemics. For example, when the plague hit Europe, some individuals by chance had mutations that allowed them to survive, and they did.\nBest Answer: Sexual reproduction allows traits that are adaptive/beneficial to spread through a population and species fairly quickly.It also allows 2 or more beneficial traits that have evolved independently in 2 or more individuals to be passed along to the same descendants.exual reproduction also promotes genetic diversity, so that a population is less susceptible in case of disease epidemics.

Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants.\nIn multicellular organisms, asexual reproduction is very rare. Asexual reproduction may have short term benefits with rapid growth in population a stable environment while sexual reproduction allows more rapid genetic diversity in generations and also allows adaptation to changing environments.\nThe sexual reproduction has many advantages over asexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, t offsprings are almost identical to their parent because they have the same genes as their parent. So, mud genetic variation is not possible in asexual reproduction. This is a disadvantage of asexual reproduction because it inhibits the further evolution of the organism. In sexual reproduction the offsprings, although similar to their parents, are not identical to them or to one another. This is because the offsprings receive some genes from the mother and some from the father.", "key": "56_3", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.141426", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
