{"version": "squash-2.0", "data": [{"paragraphs": [{"context": "\u00c7ukuri\u00e7i H\u00f6y\u00fck is situated in what is today a very fertile plain surrounded by flourishing fruit plantations. Excavations have revealed that this hill, which is clearly visible in the landscape, is in fact a prehistoric tell (H\u00f6y\u00fck): through millennia-long usage as a settled site on the same location, massive occupation layers were created which have accumulated into an artificial hill. This type of settlement is typical for the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods (8th\u20132nd millennium B.C.) from the orient to south-east Europe; in western Anatolia, however, only a few tells have so far been excavated and systematically investigated.At \u00c7ukuri\u00e7i H\u00f6y\u00fck it has been possible up until now to excavate five settlements lying on top of each other, from several periods and with differing dimensions. These offer a preliminary insight into the history of this settlement hill.Already at the end of the 7th millennium B.C. (late Neolithic/early Chalcolithic) the site was used as a settlement: as a house built with stone socles and loam walls attests, people probably settled here permanently. The diet at this early stage was already varied, and was primarily based on domestic animal husbandry of pigs, sheep, and goats as well as cattle. The diet was supplemented by the hunting of rabbits, foxes, red deer and aurochs, as well as the collecting of shellfish. The technical specialisation of the people who settled here is proven by, amongst other things, high-quality ceramic vessels and beaten stone utensils, which were predominantly produced out of imported  Obsidian. This early settlement was vacated after its destruction, the reasons for which are still unclear, and apparently abandoned.The next secure usage of the site which has been identified so far is attested approximately 1,500 years later, in the developed 4th millennium B.C. The tell would now be continuously occupied without a break until about 2,500 B.C., when in this Early Bronze Age period it was again abandoned.The Early Bronze Age was an era of great and lasting changes in the Aegean region and in south-east Europe. Presumably triggered by the demand for metals and their trade, as well as the resulting prosperity from these activities, the first proto-urban centres and large fortified settlements arose. The role of western Anatolia during this important phase of development of human society is still in many respects unclear. On \u00c7ukuri\u00e7i H\u00f6y\u00fck in this period large single-room and multi-room buildings, with massive stone socles and mudbrick walls, were constructed. The most recent of these settlements was violently destroyed, most probably by an earthquake, and was not reconstructed. The spectrum of finds points to numerous differing and specialised activities within the settlement. Of particular significance is the manufacture of copper objects: the production of these objects can be demonstrated, from the initial casting in a prefabricated mould up to the finishing process in a forge. A distinct change in the inhabitants\u2019 diet, in comparison with the previous period, can be observed: at \u00c7ukuri\u00e7i H\u00f6y\u00fck now, above all, sheep and goats were kept as domestic animals, while rabbits, foxes, wild boar and fallow deer were hunted, supplemented by the hunting of wolves, bears and various types of birds. The sea was also increasingly exploited as a source of food: in addition to the utilization of shellfish, already attested for the earlier periods, in the Early Bronze Age there is also evidence for the catching of fish, in both shallow and deep waters.", "qas": [{"id": "question_0", "question": "What is located in the present day", "answers": [{"text": "\u00c7ukuri\u00e7i H\u00f6y\u00fck is
