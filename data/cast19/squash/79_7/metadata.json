{"input_text": "The second group, composed of academics such as  Chalmers Johnson ,  Neil Smelser ,  Bob Jessop ,  Mark Hart ,  Edward A. Tiryakian ,  Mark Hagopian , followed in the footsteps of  Talcott Parsons  and the  structural-functionalist  theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.\nHis work was widely criticized due to what were perceived critical attacks on the discipline. This can be seen in his writings where he criticizes both the \u201cmethodological inhibition\u201d of what he refers to as abstract empiricism (i.e. the work of Paul F. Lazarsfield) and what he refers to as the \u201cfetishisation of concepts\u201d in the works of those such as Talcott Parsons. Mills criticized the \"grand theory\" and the  positivism  of  structural functionalism  in Parsons' work (Brewer, 2004, 322-324).\nA broad historical paradigm in both sociology and  anthropology , functionalism addresses the  social structure , referred to as  social organization  in among the classical theorists, as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by  Herbert Spencer ) is to regard  norm s and  institution s as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as  Marcel Mauss ,  Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski  and  Radcliffe-Brown . It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of  social evolutionism , in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As  Giddens  states: \"Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects).\"\nJames Mahoney revisited the debate over general theory in historical sociology. By bridging the gaps of different assumptions, causal agents and causal mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis, and this is seen as the general theory. \"...the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research. General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions. These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses, integrate existing findings, and explain historical outcomes. To illustrate these applications, the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology: functionalist, rational choice, power, neo-Darwinian, and cultural theories. A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories\".<ref>Mahoney, James. \"Revisiting General Theory in Historical Sociology.\" EBSCOhost. Web. 4 Nov. 2010.\nAnother criticism describes the  ontological  argument that society cannot have \"needs\" as a human being does, and even if society does have needs they need not be met.  Anthony Giddens  argues that functionalist explanations may all be rewritten as historical accounts of individual human actions and consequences (see  Structuration ).\nThe first \"modern\" social theories (known as classical theories) that begin to resemble the analytic social theory of today developed almost simultaneously with the birth of the science of sociology.  Auguste Comte  (1798\u20131857), known as the \"father of sociology\" and regarded by some as the first philosopher of science, laid the groundwork for  positivism  \u2013 as well as  structural functionalism  and  social evolutionism . In the 19th century three great classical theories of social and historical change emerged: the  social evolutionism  theory (of which  Social Darwinism  forms a part), the  social cycle theory  and the  Marxist   historical materialism  theory.\nThe functional theory of  David Mitrany  is the oldest institutional theory of IR. Mitrany suggested that slim \"functional agencies\" should organize the needs of cooperation among even conflicting states. The  neofunctionalism  and the communitarian method of  Jean Monnet  advocated the principle of  supranationality : international bodies superordinated to the nation states should administer the common interests. The functionalist approaches have been often criticized to be idealistic and normative in their positive view on  international institutions .\nThe contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic as a result of the contentions of classical social theory. In  Randall Collins ' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ( Simmel ) and  pragmatist  ( Mead ,  Cooley ) theories of social interaction.  Utilitarianism , also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with  economics , is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by  Raewyn Connell , a tradition that is often forgotten is that of  Social Darwinism , which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily  Herbert Spencer ,  Lester F. Ward  and  William Graham Sumner . Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.\nHerbert Spencer  (1820\u20131903) was a  British   philosopher  famous for applying the theory of  natural selection  to society. He was in many ways the first true sociological functionalist. In fact, while Durkheim is widely considered the most important functionalist among positivist theorists, it is well known that much of his analysis was culled from reading Spencer's work, especially his Principles of Sociology (1874\u201396). In describing society, Spencer alludes to the analogy of human body. Just as the structural parts of the human body - the skeleton, muscles, and various internal organs \u2013 function independently to help the entire organism survive, social structures work together to preserve society.\nThe contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic.

Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.\nThe Theory of Communicative Action () is a two-volume 1981 book by  J\u00fcrgen Habermas , in which Habermas continues his project of finding a way to ground \"the social sciences in a theory of language\", which had been set out in On the Logic of the Social Sciences (1967). The two volumes are Reason and the Rationalization of Society (Handlungsrationalit\u00e4t und gesellschaftliche Rationalisierung), in which Habermas establishes a concept of communicative rationality, and Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason (Zur Kritik der funktionalistischen Vernunft), in which Habermas creates the two level concept of society and lays out the critical theory for modernity.  After writing The Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas expanded upon the theory of communicative action by using it as the basis of his theory of  morality , democracy, and law. The work has inspired many responses by social theorists and philosophers, and in 1998 was listed by the  International Sociological Association  as the eighth most important sociological book of the 20th century.\nKarl Marx  rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a science of society based on  historical materialism , becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning. Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including  Max Weber  and  Georg Simmel , developed sociological  antipositivism . The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian  positivism  and  structural functionalism ; Marxist  historical materialism  and  conflict theory ; and Weberian  antipositivism  and  verstehen  analysis. American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with  pragmatism  and  social psychology . In the 1920s, the  Chicago school  developed  symbolic interactionism . Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the  Frankfurt School  pioneered the idea of  critical theory , an interdisciplinary form of  Marxist sociology  drawing upon thinkers as diverse as  Sigmund Freud  and  Friedrich Nietzsche . Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after  World War II , influencing  literary criticism  and the  Birmingham School  establishment of  cultural studies .\nDilthey was also interested in what some would call  sociology  in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . He objected to their  dialectic al/ evolution ist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, as well as their narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of  positivism  was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good things to say about the  neo-Kantian  sociology of  Georg Simmel , with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of  Max Weber , the primary founder of sociological  antipositivism . J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of  nonpositivist verstehende sociology  and the  Verstehen  method.\nFunctionalists seek an objective understanding of the social world. They have a more positivist view of social science, believing objective results can be obtained by techniques like surveys and interviews. They discount the inherent bias of the intellectual, believing their results are value-free.  Functionalism  grew from the work of  Max Weber  and   \u00c9mile Durkheim . Functionalism was popular in the US during the period from 1930 to 1960. Humanistic sociology had a role in the decline of functionalism. This can be seen in the rise of later models which returned to a focus of the subjective nature of human experience, for example, the later popularity of post-modern thinking highlighting the subjective basis of  semantics . Humanistic sociology also differentiates itself from functionalism in promoting the need for freedom of thinking in the practices of research. Functionalists reject the idea of a realist or structural analysis, seeking instead a more observable explanation with external validation outside the social system.\nAs such, his work was not well received.  Both in Britain and in America he came under criticism. In Britain his work was criticized for the extent to which he was seen to attack empirical Sociology which was then common in Britain at the time. In America, his criticism of structural functionalism and of its accompanying critiques of power and stratification made him somewhat subject to severe criticism (Brewer, 2004, 328-330).\nThe sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War. After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of  Talcott Parsons , for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control. In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as  Philip Selznick , argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well. Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist  Donald Black , developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of  pure sociology . Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the  autopoietic system s theory of the German sociologist  Niklas Luhmann , who presents law or \"the legal system\" as one of the ten function systems (see  functional differentiation ) of society\nWhile absent from empirical sociology, functionalist themes remained detectable in sociological theory, most notably in the works of  Luhmann  and Giddens. There are, however, signs of an incipient revival, as functionalist claims have recently been bolstered by developments in  multilevel selection theory  and in empirical research on how groups solve  social dilemma s. Recent developments in  evolutionary theory \u2014especially by biologist  David Sloan Wilson  and  anthropologists   Robert Boyd  and  Peter Richerson \u2014have provided strong support for structural functionalism in the form of multilevel selection theory. In this theory, culture and social structure are seen as a  Darwinian  (biological or cultural)  adaptation  at the group level.\nAccording to Comte, scientific method constrains itself to observations, but frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws\u2014positive statements\u2014irrefutable by theology or by metaphysics, and laid as  foundation for subsequent knowledge .  Later, concluding science insufficient for society, Comte launched  Religion of Humanity , whose churches, honoring eminent scientists, led worship of humankind.  Comte coined the term  altruism , and emphasized  science's application  for humankind's social welfare, which would be revealed by Comte's spearheaded science, sociology.  Comte's influence is prominent in  Herbert Spencer  of England and  \u00c9mile Durkheim  of France establishing modern empirical and functionalist sociology.  Influential in the latter 19th century, positivism was often linked to evolutionary theory, yet was eclipsed in the 20th century by  neopositivism : logical positivism and logical empiricism.\nFurther criticisms have been levelled at functionalism by proponents of other social theories, particularly  conflict theorists ,  Marxists ,  feminists  and  postmodernists . Conflict theorists criticized functionalism's concept of systems as giving far too much weight to integration and consensus, and neglecting independence and conflict [Holmwood, 2005:100]. Lockwood [in Holmwood, 2005:101], in line with conflict theory, suggested that Parsons' theory missed the concept of system contradiction. He did not account for those parts of the system that might have tendencies to Mal-integration. According to Lockwood, it was these tendencies that come to the surface as opposition and conflict among actors. However Parsons thought that the issues of conflict and cooperation were very much intertwined and sought to account for both in his model [Holmwood, 2005:103]. In this however he was limited by his analysis of an \u2018ideal type' of society which was characterized by consensus. Merton, through his critique of functional unity, introduced into functionalism an explicit analysis of tension and conflict. Yet Merton's functionalist explanations of social phenomena continued to rest on the idea that society is primarily co-operative rather than conflicted, which differentiates Merton from conflict theorists.\nStronger criticisms include the  epistemological  argument that functionalism is  tautologous , that is it attempts to account for the development of social institutions solely through recourse to the effects that are attributed to them and thereby explains the two circularly. However, Parsons drew directly on many of Durkheim's concepts in creating his theory. Certainly Durkheim was one of the first theorists to explain a phenomenon with reference to the function it served for society. He said, \"the determination of function is\u2026necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena\" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. However Durkheim made a clear distinction between historical and functional analysis, saying, \"When ... the explanation of a social phenomenon is undertaken, we must seek separately the efficient cause which produces it and the function it fulfills\" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. If Durkheim made this distinction, then it is unlikely that Parsons did not. However Merton does explicitly state that functional analysis does not seek to explain why the action happened in the first instance, but why it continues or is reproduced. By this particular logic, it can be argued that functionalists do not necessarily explain the original cause of a phenomenon with reference to its effect. Yet the logic stated in reverse, that social phenomena are (re)produced because they serve ends, is unoriginal to functionalist thought. Thus functionalism is either undefinable or it can be defined by the teleological arguments which functionalist theorists normatively produced before Merton.\nConflict theories. Conflict theories are perspectives in sociology that emphasize the social, political, or material inequality of a social group, that critique the broad socio-political system, or that otherwise detract from structural functionalism and ideological conservativism.onflict theories. Conflict theories are perspectives in sociology that emphasize the social, political, or material inequality of a social group, that critique the broad socio-political system, or that otherwise detract from structural functionalism and ideological conservativism.\nThis approach looks at both social structure and social functions. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements; namely norms, customs, traditions, and institutions.n the 1960s, functionalism was criticized for being unable to account for social change, or for structural contradictions and conflict (and thus was often called  consensus theory ). Also, it ignores inequalities including race, gender, class, which causes tension and conflict.\nMarxism which was revived soon after the emergence of conflict theory, criticized professional sociology (functionalism and conflict theory alike) for being partisan to advanced welfare capitalism [Holmwood, 2005:103].", "key": "79_7", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.361767", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
