However, Parsons drew directly on many of Durkheim's concepts in creating his theory. Certainly Durkheim was one of the first theorists to explain a phenomenon with reference to the function it served for society. He said, \"the determination of function is\u2026necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena\" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. However Durkheim made a clear distinction between historical and functional analysis, saying, \"When... the explanation of a social phenomenon is undertaken, we must seek separately the efficient cause which produces it and the function it fulfills\" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. If Durkheim made this distinction, then it is unlikely that Parsons did not. However Merton does explicitly state that functional analysis does not seek to explain why the action happened in the first instance, but why it continues or is reproduced. By this particular logic, it can be argued that functionalists don't necessarily explain the original cause of a phenomenon with reference to its effect. Yet the logic stated in reverse, that social phenomena are (re)produced because they serve ends, is unoriginal to functionalist thought.
