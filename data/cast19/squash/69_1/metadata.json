{"input_text": "Melatonin is known to aid in reducing the effects of  jet lag , especially in eastward travel, by promoting the necessary reset of the body's sleep-wake phase. If the timing is not correct, however, it can instead delay adaption.\nOften, treatment is ignored for persons with the jet lag type because people eventually return to their regular time zone and normal sleep-wake cycle and no longer exhibit symptoms. For people who travel often, it is   preferable to adjust to the new time zone by sleeping at times appropriate to that zone if they intend to be there for one week or longer. Diets that target jet lag are also effective for some people, and light therapy, which involves exposure to a lighted device to simulate daytime, may be  helpful to some people to adjust to new time zones.\nLight therapy has been tested for individuals with  shift work sleep disorder , and for  jet lag .\nTravelling by 10 hours or more is usually best managed by assuming it is a 14-hour westward transition and delaying the body clock. A customised jet lag program can be obtained from an online jet lag calculator. These programs consider the sleep pattern of the user, the number of time zones crossed, and the direction of travel. The efficacy of these jet lag calculators has not been documented.\nHypnotics are often used to treat the symptoms of insomnia, or other sleep disorders. Benzodiazepines are still among the most widely prescribed sedative-hypnotics in the United States today. Certain non-benzodiazepine drugs are used as hypnotics as well. Although they lack the chemical structure of the benzodiazepines, their sedative effect is similarly through action on the GABAA receptor. They also have a reputation of being less addictive than benzodiazepines.  Melatonin , a naturally-occurring hormone, is often used over the counter (OTC) to treat insomnia and jet lag. This hormone appears to be excreted by the pineal gland early during the sleep cycle and may contribute to human  circadian rhythms . Because OTC melatonin supplements are not subject to careful and consistent manufacturing, more specific melatonin agonists are sometimes preferred. They are used for their action on melatonin receptors in the  suprachiasmatic nucleus , responsible for sleep-wake cycles. Many barbiturates have or had an FDA-approved indication for use as sedative-hypnotics, but have become less widely used because of their limited safety margin in overdose, their potential for dependence, and the degree of central nervous system depression they induce. The amino-acid  L-tryptophan  is also available OTC, and seems to be free of dependence or abuse liability. However, it is not as powerful as the traditional hypnotics. Because of the possible role of serotonin in sleep patterns, a new generation of 5-HT antagonists are in current development as hypnotics.\nTiming of exercise and food consumption have also been suggested as remedies, though their applicability in humans and practicality for most travellers are not certain, and no firm guidelines exist. There are very little data supporting the use of diet to adjust to jet lag. While there are data supporting the use of exercise, the intensity of exercise that may be required is significant, and possibly difficult to maintain for non-athletes. These strategies may be used both before departure and after landing. Individuals may differ in their susceptibility to jet lag and in how quickly they can adjust to new sleep-wake schedules.\nJet lag - jet lag and late night schedules disrupt circadian cycle of melatonin.

Sleep disorders (including insomnia, jet lag and circadian rhythm disorders) Action. Melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal gland in a 24-hour circadian rhythm, regulating the normal sleep/wake cycle. As a supplement, melatonin has both phase-shifting and sleep-promoting properties. In addition to promoting sleep, physiologic roles of melatonin include regulation of the secretion of growth hormone and gonadotropic hormones.\nIf you sleep on your right side, you should choose a seat that is on the right side of the plane, and vice versa if you are a left side sleeper.

Levels of the hormone drop during the day and rise at night. Studies suggest that melatonin helps restore sleep when the body's internal clock is disrupted like when people work at night and sleep during the day or as a result of jet lag.elatonin overdose can lead to severe drowsiness and affect your sleep-wake cycle. Symptoms of a melatonin overdose may include headache, drowsiness, and upset stomach.
