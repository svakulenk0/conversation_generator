{"input_text": "A heritage turkey is one of a variety of strains of  domestic turkey  which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority of turkeys raised for consumption since the mid-20th century. Heritage turkeys can be differentiated from other domestic turkeys in that they are biologically capable of being raised in a manner that more closely matches the natural behavior and life cycle of  wild turkey s. Heritage turkeys have a relatively long lifespan and a much slower growth rate than turkeys bred for  industrial agriculture , and unlike industrially-bred turkeys, can  reproduce  without  artificial insemination .\nThe common names for  Meleagris gallopavo  (the  wild turkey  of North America, but best known worldwide from the  domesticated turkey ), in other languages also frequently reflect its exotic origins, seen from a European viewpoint, and confusion about where it actually comes from. See  Turkey (bird)  for the  etymology  of the English name and the scientific name Meleagris.\nBronze turkeys are the product of crossing domestic turkeys brought from England, with the  wild turkey . These matings produced a bird that was larger and more robust than the European turkeys, and tamer than wild turkeys. Though the Bronze turkey type was created in the 18th century, the actual name was not used until the 1830s, when a strain developed in the  U.S. state  of  Rhode Island  was named the  Point Judith  Bronze. The name later spread to be used in reference to the breed as a whole, and was in the process simplified to just \"Bronze\". In the  British Isles , the Bronze was associated with Cambridge, and was called the Cambridge Bronze, but again this name has been simplified to just \"Bronze\".\nTurkeys are large, long-legged birds that can grow up to four feet in height and weigh up to 30 lbs in the wild.  They have a long, broad, rounded tail with 14-19 blunt feathers.  They have a naked, wrinkled head and feathered body.  The North American wild turkey \u2013 Meleagris gallopavo \u2013 has five distinct subspecies (Eastern, Rio Grande, Florida [Osceola], Merriam's, and Gould's).  Hybrids also exist where the ranges of these subspecies overlap.  All are native only to North America, though transplanted populations exist elsewhere.  Their plumage differs slightly by subspecies, but is generally dark to black for males, with buff to cream highlights, and generally drab brown for females.  The feathers are quite iridescent and can take on distinct reddish/copper hues in sunlight.  Their feathers are well defined with broad, square ends, giving the bird the appearance of being covered in scales.  Males have a \u201cbeard\u201d of coarse black bristles hanging from the center of their upper breasts and tend to have more vibrantly colored plumage than do females. They breed in the spring and their typical clutch size is between 10 and 12 eggs.  The  ocellated turkey  (Meleagris ocellata), a different species of turkey, currently exists only in a portion of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.  After the 19th and early 20th centuries, wild turkey populations dropped significantly because of hunting and habitat loss.  However, populations now flourish again due to hunting management and transplanting.  The ocellated turkey, not commonly hunted, is currently threatened due to ongoing habitat loss in the Yucutan.\nA number of turkeys have been described from  fossil s.  The Meleagridinae are known from the  Early Miocene  (c. 23  mya ) onwards, with the  extinct   genera   Rhegminornis  (Early Miocene of Bell, U.S.) and  Proagriocharis  (Kimball  Late Miocene / Early Pliocene  of Lime Creek, U.S.). The former is probably a  basal turkey , the other a more contemporary bird not very similar to known turkeys; both were much smaller birds. A turkey fossil not assignable to genus but similar to Meleagris is known from the Late Miocene of  Westmoreland County, Virginia . In the modern genus Meleagris, a considerable number of species have been described, as turkey fossils are robust and fairly often found, and turkeys show great variation among individuals. Many of these supposed fossilized species are now considered  junior synonym s. One, the well-documented  California turkey  Meleagris californica, became extinct recently enough to have been hunted by early human settlers. It is believed its demise was due to the combined pressures caused by hunting and by  climate change  at the end of the  last glacial period .\nThe other theory arises from the fact that turkeys came to England from the Americas via merchant ships from the Middle East where they were  domesticated  successfully. Again the importers lent the name to the bird: because these merchants were called \"Turkey merchants\" as much of the area was part of the  Ottoman Empire . Hence the name \u201cTurkey birds\u201d or, soon thereafter, \u201cturkeys\u201d.\nThe wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is an upland ground bird native to  North America  and is the heaviest member of the diverse  Galliformes . It is the same  species  as the  domestic turkey , which was originally derived from a southern Mexican  subspecies  of wild turkey (not the related  ocellated turkey ). Although native to North America, the turkey probably got its name from the domesticated variety being imported to Britain in ships coming from the  Levant  via Spain. The British at the time therefore associated the wild turkey with the country  Turkey  and the name prevails.\nThere are two species of turkey pursued as game animals in North America, the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and the  ocellated turkey  (Meleagris ocellata).  The wild turkey is further divided into six subspecies.  To harvest a bird from the Eastern, Osceola, Rio Grande, and Merriam's wild turkey subspecies is known in turkey hunting circles as a \"grand slam\". Harvesting a bird from all the subspecies in the \"grand slam\" as well as the Gould's wild turkey subspecies and the ocellated turkey is known as a \"world slam\".\nThe turkey is a large  bird  in the  genus   Meleagris, which is native to the Americas. One species, Meleagris gallopavo (commonly known as the  domestic turkey  or  wild turkey ), is native to the forests of North America, from Mexico, throughout the midwest and eastern United States, and into southeastern Canada. The other  living species  is Meleagris ocellata or the  ocellated turkey , native to the forests of the  Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula .  Males of both turkey species have a distinctive fleshy  wattle  or protuberance that hangs from the top of the beak (called a  snood ). They are among the largest birds in their ranges. As in many  galliformes , the male is larger and much more colorful than the female.\nThere are two theories for the derivation of the name \"turkey\" for this bird, according to  Columbia University  professor of  Romance language s  Mario Pei . One theory is that when Europeans first encountered turkeys in America, they incorrectly identified the birds as a type of  guineafowl , which were already being imported into Europe by  Turkey merchant s via  Constantinople  and were therefore  nickname d Turkey coqs. The name of the North American bird thus became \"turkey fowl\" or \"Indian turkeys,\" which was then shortened to just \"turkeys\".\nIn many countries, the names for turkeys have different derivations. Ironically, many of these names incorporate an assumed  India n origin, such as diiq Hindi (\"Indian rooster\") in  Arabia n countries, dinde (\"from India\") in  French , Indjushka (\"bird of India\") in  Russia , indyk in  Poland , and Hindi (\"India\") in  Turkey . These are thought to arise from the thought that  Christopher Columbus  had originally believed that he had reached India rather than the Americas on his voyage.  In Portuguese a turkey is a peru; the name is thought to derive from the eponymous country Per\u00fa.\nTurkey Fest is a local festival during which the townsfolk compete with people at various turkey-centric events. The competitions revolve around the turkeys each town raises and in which each takes immense pride. The events are the prettiest turkey contest, turkey toss, turkey trot, and turkey race. Unlike most  turkey trot s, where humans do the racing, in Cuero, the \"turkey trot\" involves racing actual turkeys.\nThe wild turkey, throughout its range, plays a significant role in the cultures of many  Native American tribe s all over North America. Outside of the Thanksgiving feast, it is a favorite meal in eastern tribes. Eastern Native American tribes consumed both the eggs and meat, sometimes turning the latter into a type of jerky to preserve it and make it last through cold weather. They provided habitat by burning down portions of forests to create meadows which would attract mating birds, and thus give a clear shot to hunters. The feathers of turkeys also often made their way into the rituals and headgear of many tribes. Many leaders, such as  Catawba  chiefs, traditionally wore turkey feather headdresses. Significant peoples of several tribes, including  Muscogee Creek  and  Wampanoag , wore turkey feather cloaks. The turkey clan is one of the three  Lenape  clans. Movements of wild turkeys inspired the  Caddo  tribe's  turkey dance .The  Navajo people  of Southeastern Arizona, New Mexico and Utah call the turkey  T\u0105zhii and relate the bird to the corn and seeds which The Turkey in Navajo folklore brought from the Third Navajo World.  It is one of the Navajos' sacred birds, with the Navajo people using the feathers and parts in multiple traditional ceremonies.\nThe south Mexican wild turkey is considered the  nominate subspecies , and the only one that is not found in the United States or Canada. In central Mexico, archaeological M. gallopavo bones have been identified at sites dating to 800\u2013100 BC [10], [11]. It is unclear whether these early specimens represent wild or domestic individuals, but domestic turkeys were likely established in central Mexico by the first half of the Classic Period (c. AD 200\u20131000).  Late Preclassic (300 BC\u2013AD 100) turkey remains identified at the archaeological site of El Mirador (Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala) represent the earliest evidence of the export of the Mexican turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) to the ancient Maya world.  The  Mexican  subspecies, M. g. gallopavo, was  domesticated , either in Mexico or by Preclassic peoples in  Mesoamerica , giving rise to the  domestic turkey . The Spaniards brought this tamed subspecies back to Europe with them in the mid-16th century; from Spain it spread to France and later Britain as a farmyard animal, usually becoming the centerpiece of a feast for the well-to-do. By 1620 it was common enough so that Pilgrim settlers of Massachusetts could bring turkeys with them from  England , unaware that it had a larger close relative already occupying the forests of Massachusetts. It is one of the smallest subspecies and is best known in Spanish from its Aztec-derived name, guajolote. This wild turkey subspecies is thought to be critically endangered, as of 2010.\nCuero and its large turkey growing industry bills itself as the \"Turkey Capital of the World\". The turkey industry in Cuero began large scale operations in 1908.  Much like ranchers had cattle drives, Cuero poultry growers drove their turkeys down Main Street to the local packing plant.  Each year the crowds grew to watch the sight and sound of upwards of 20,000 turkeys going through town. The first annual Cuero Turkey Trot celebration began in 1912, complete with the \"Turkey Trot\" dance music of the era.  By the 1970s, the event had become a 3-day typical Texas celebration with parades, live entertainment, food booths and street dances.\nTurkey meat, commonly referred to as just turkey,  is the  meat  from  turkeys , typically  domesticated turkey s. It is a popular  poultry  product used for culturally significant events such as  Thanksgiving ,  Christmas , and  New Year's Eve  as well as for everyday nourishment.\nThey were first domesticated in Mexico and brought to Europe in the 16th century.

Overall, the mortality rate of turkeys during the first 2 weeks of life is about 70%, though longevity increases after this critical time period.The average turkey probably lives to about 11/2 years of age. Individuals may live longer, but any turkey over 6 years old is definitely an old-timer.Based on a banded bird, the oldest known eastern turkey (coincidentally from Massachusetts) was at least 15 years old at death.Rio Grande turkeys have lived to 14, Florida turkeys to 13, and Merriam's turkeys to 91/2 years of age.ased on a banded bird, the oldest known eastern turkey (coincidentally from Massachusetts) was at least 15 years old at death.
