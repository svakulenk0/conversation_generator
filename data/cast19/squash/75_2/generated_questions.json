A turkey fossil not assignable to genus but similar to Meleagris is known from the Late Miocene of  Westmoreland County, Virginia. In the modern genus Meleagris, a considerable number of species have been described, as turkey fossils are robust and fairly often found, and turkeys show great variation among individuals. Many of these supposed fossilized species are now considered  junior synonym s. One, the well-documented  California turkey  Meleagris californica, became extinct recently enough to have been hunted by early human settlers. It is believed its demise was due to the combined pressures caused by hunting and by  climate change  at the end of the  last glacial period.", "qas": [{"id": "question_89", "question": "What did he do there", "answers": [{"text": "A number of turkeys have been described from  fossil s.
