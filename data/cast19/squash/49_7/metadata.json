{"input_text": "Some  Internet-based subscription services  also offer programmed \"channels\" that are available a la carte. With its 50 million subscribers worldwide,  Netflix 's streaming service established the sector, providing original programming as well as television series and films acquired from various distributors for a set monthly fee, with shows available  on-demand . Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos made the distinction by noting that subscribers \"can cancel Netflix with one click. Try calling your cable company and getting rid of a channel you\u2019re not watching.\" In October 2014, HBO and  CBS  announced comparable  over-the-top  services ( HBO Now  and CBS All Access) distributed via the Internet and mobile devices, as did  Lions Gate Entertainment  in partnership with Tribeca Entertainment.\nIn 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by  Blockbuster  for $50 million, but the offer was declined. Netflix initiated an  initial public offering  (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of  common stock  at the price of  US$ 15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different film titles were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.\nAlso in January Netflix announced it would begin blocking  virtual private network s, or VPNs. At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.\nIn April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide. But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. Albeit, Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011. Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion. On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period. On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.\nIn 1998, about a year after Netflix's founding, the company grew by starting in the  DVD by mail  business. In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and  Blu-ray  rental service. The company expanded internationally with streaming made available to Canada in 2010 and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix was available in over 190 countries. Netflix entered the production business in 2013, debuting its first series,  House of Cards . It greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering \" Netflix Original \" content through its online library of films and television. Netflix is releasing an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.\nSarandos was responsible for initiating the first round of original programming at Netflix, starting with  Lilyhammer , and then continuing with the breakout  David Fincher  series starring  Kevin Spacey ,  House of Cards . Beginning with House of Cards, which was bought for $100 million in a March 2011 deal, Sarandos created the model where Netflix purchases multiple seasons of shows without pilot orders. Sarandos see the focus as being on subscriber growth as a reflection of revenue health over ratings, especially because the ad-supported model doesn't apply to Netflix.\nThe initial launches in Canada and in Latin America happened (albeit barely) before Netflix's 2011 controversy in the United States. In September of that year, the company decided to switch to two separate plans (one for streaming and one for DVD), hiked its prices accordingly, and attempted a move to two websites (one for streaming and one for DVD rentals). The change to its business model was accompanied by a loss of approximately one million American users and a plunging stock price. Prior to announcing the change to service stock was valued at just around $300, after the price it plunged to less than $53 a share. Prior to this debacle, Netflix had been having its most successful quarter, mainly due to the decision to expand to Latin America. The company quickly lost all the money it made in the quarter it announced growth to Latin America, was forced to apologize, and rethink its changing model.\nIn July 2011, Netflix announced that subscription prices were changing: that DVD rental prices would drop by 20%, but that the initially free streaming service would now be charged. For many customers this represented a savings, but for the group that both received discs and enjoyed streaming, it would result in a cost increase of up to 60%. The move led to reported customer backlash, cancellations, less than projected subscriber growth, and a decline in stock price. In response, Netflix admitted to poor public relations decisions in announcing the change but kept its policy in place.\nPrior to its international expansion in 2010, Netflix's subscriber base grew on average by 2.4 million people a year. Following its arrival in Canada, Latin America, and eventually Europe, its subscriber base has grown on average by 7 million people a year, making international expansion key to Netflix's continued growth in the global marketplace. Notably, the company has over 20 original shows planned for release in 2015 and 2016. In that bunch are Netflix's first non-English language series.\nNetflix UK and Ireland reached its millionth subscriber faster than Netflix Canada, nabbing its millionth member by July 2012. In the UK, BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board) reported Netflix as being extremely successful in the UK market. More than one in ten households in the country subscribed to the service by 2014. More than twice as many people subscribed to Netflix than to Amazon Prime. As of the fall of 2014, Netflix had three million UK subscribers which was more twice as many as it had in 2013. Netflix is estimated to have over 300,000 subscribers in Ireland as of 2016.\nBy 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the  United States Postal Service 's  first-class service  to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals. On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent  subsidiary  called  Qwikster , separating DVD rental and streaming services. Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry  video game s whereas Netflix did not. However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.\nThe launch in Latin America was not as successful as the company had hoped. While in Latin America, Netflix had no streaming competitors as it did in Canada, the digital divide (a lack of high broadband internet penetration) hindered rapid growth. In Brazil, for example, only 20% of the population had an internet speed greater than ;  a second are needed to stream Netflix's content. Furthermore, the lack of competitors in some ways slowed growth as well. Whereas in Canada new subscribers had been exposed to streaming content by other companies, the concept was newer to a wide Latin American audience, making some skeptical of the prospect. A banking system unused to recurrent monthly transactions exacerbated the problem. Still, while Latin American expansion happened more slowly than expected, Netflix was not out anything for the expansion and their Canadian expansion happened at a faster rate than expected, making their first two forays into the international market fairly successful. Additionally, despite the hindrances to growth in Latin America, Netflix continued in pursuit of content expansion, signing a deal with Fox in May 2012 (for a July 15 start) to make its popular content (e.g.,  How I Met Your Mother , Glee, Bones, The X-Files, Wall Street) available in the region.\nNetflix has been one of the most successful  dot-com ventures . In September 2002,  The New York Times  reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers. The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of  DVD player s in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period. That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013. As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States). By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers. By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.\nStreaming service's share of online traffic is approaching 40%. Netflix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominance over our streaming habits is only continuing to grow. According to a new report from Sandvine, Netflix now accounts more almost 37% of downstream Internet traffic in North America during peak evening hours, up from about 35% in November. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of online traffic has been ticking up steadily as it has built its subscriber base over the years. Netflix now has more than 40 million members in the U.S. and more than 60 million globally.\nAs a subscriber-based model, Netflix depends on expanding its base of customers to make money as opposed to traditional TV networks relying on advertising dollars. With the price increase, DiClemente has lowered his estimations for Netflix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international growth. While the decline in new customers will be somewhat offset by the additional revenue, Netflix is banking on the number of cancellations falling into their projected margins.\nHow many subscribers does Netflix have? Netflix is by far the biggest subscription streaming service in the business. As of last month, they reported 65.6 million subscribers, including 42.3 million in the United States alone. Hulu reported that it has nearly 9 million subscribers, up from around 6 million in 2014. That lags behind Netflix, obviously, but the growth rate is very impressive.\nThe market is punishing Netflix for coming up short on U.S. customer growth, but that hasn't created a buying opportunity, says Morningstar's Neil Macker. 1  Netflix Adds 3.62 Million Subscribers, But U.S. Growth Lags.\nToday it reported 2.23 million new US subscribers, much better than the 1.85 million that analysts had projected.
