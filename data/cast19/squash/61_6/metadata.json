The series starred The Leymen, a magic-themed  superhero  team in the fictional  DC Universe .

His mind affected by subtle incompatibilities between the two universes, he sees the  Justice League  as overlords who demand praise and worship in return for heroic actions. He especially gets angry at  Superman , who (likewise affected) sees the Avengers as heroes who don't do enough and let their world down. During the first confrontation, Cap and  Batman  battle but reach a standstill, Batman saying it is conceivable Cap could beat him, but asks if he wants to. The two decide to team up to solve the mystery of the game. At the  Bat-Cave  Cap comments on the fact Batman lost  a partner , possibly thinking of  Bucky Barnes . They figure out the plan after Cap gets an inter-dimensional vehicle from the FF that allow them to get to the Grandmaster's headquarters, where they encounter the  Atom , who shows them recordings of the event, revealing the Avengers are fighting for  Krona . Their intervention in the last battle, where Cap makes sure Batman can get the cube so the JLA wins the game by using his shield to get the cube from Quicksilver, causes the villain Krona to go mad and attack the Grandmaster. Cap and Batman together convince the two teams to fight Krona. The Grandmaster then causes the two universes to merge, imprisoning Krona between them. Cap is the only Marvel hero to sense reality changing and his attack on Superman, who also realises the changes, shatters the fixed reality. He commands a group of heroes from both worlds in a wintry Metropolis when they are attacked by a group of villains. He and Superman again argue after he realizes Krona, from the DC Universe is responsible for the chaos, but are stopped by  Wonder Woman . The two teams find the  Grandmaster , who shows them the way their realities are supposed to be. Despite seeing shocking revelations, the two teams decide to face Krona. Cap leads the teams as a battle tactician at Superman's suggestion, communicating orders through the  Martian Manhunter 's telepathy, and gives Superman his shield. Before the battle he and Superman apologize to each other, claiming they each have fears of doing what the other accused them of. During the battle Cap is confronted by  Prometheus  after the Martian Manhunter is brought down by chronal chaos, whom he defeats despite them uploading Batman's skills after he gets his shield back. His ideas ultimately defeat Krona, after  Flash  and  Hawkeye  are nearly killed by  Dreamslayer , he tells them to pretend they are dead and lay low, they stop Krona's plan after he has defeated all the other heroes. Cap is among the core heroes at the end when reality is restored. He and Superman salute each other as they are transported back to their own dimensions, saying they fight on.\nBattalion is a  fictional character  in the  DC Comics  universe.

When Captain America and  Superman  attack each other, the facade of a merged world breaks, and Vision is the first hero shown in the devastated world, in a snowy Metropolis.

After being defeated by a group of villains and rescued by a group of heroes, Vision joins the two teams against Krona, even though he is shown an image of the true Marvel universe, in which he is destroyed and rebuilt, and his two sons are taken away. During the battle he is badly damaged. When he sees Superman being attacked by  Radioactive Man  and  Solarr , Vision uses his last stores of solar energy to revive Superman, then dies.

However, there are also many superhero teams. Some, such as the  Fantastic Four ,  DNAgents , and the  X-Men , have common origins and usually operate as a group. Some are families in which the parents and kids have superpowers, like  The Incredibles . Others, such as  DC Comics \u2019s  Justice League  and  Marvel \u2019s  Avengers , are \"all-star\" groups consisting of heroes with separate origins who also operate individually, yet will  team up  to confront larger threats. The shared setting or \"universes\" of Marvel, DC and other publishers also allow for regular superhero  crossover  team-ups. Some superheroes, especially those introduced in the 1940s, work with a young  sidekick  (e.g.  Batman  and  Robin ,  Captain America  and  Bucky ). This has become less common since more sophisticated writing and older audiences have lessened the need for characters who specifically appeal to child readers. Sidekicks are seen as a separate classification of superheroes.\nWhile trying to discover the secret of universal creation, Krona destroys entire universes, eventually arriving in the  Marvel Universe . There he confronts the  Grandmaster , who, in an attempt to save his universe, informs Krona of the existence of a being in the Marvel Universe who has witnessed the Big Bang. In exchange for Krona not destroying this universe, the Grandmaster and he will play a game; two teams, one from each universe, seek out 12 items of great power, six from each universe. Should Krona's team (the  Avengers ) win, Grandmaster will give the knowledge Krona seeks in return for not destroying his universe. But when Grandmaster's team (the  Justice League ) wins\u2014thanks in part to  Batman ,  Captain America  and the  Atom  having discovered the nature of the game in time to ensure that the League win instead of declaring a draw\u2014Krona strikes down the Grandmaster in a rage, draining his knowledge to learn the identity of the being he spoke of, allowing him to summon  Galactus . He then repeats the process with Galactus, but the Grandmaster tricks him and uses the power of the items to lock Krona at the multiversal junction point, having linked the two universes together.\nHe worked as a storyboard artist on Marvel's  Hulk Vs  and DC's  Wonder Woman , both of which were deemed successful. After working on six other DC Comics projects such as  Green Lantern: First Flight ,  Superman/Batman: Public Enemies ,  Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths ,  Batman: Under the Red Hood ,  Superman/Batman: Apocalypse  and  All-Star Superman , he was asked to once again direct an animated film but this time for  WB /DC,  Green Lantern: Emerald Knights  which received many positive reviews.

Another title, The Avengers vs The Justice League of America was written by  Gerry Conway  and drawn by  George P\u00e9rez  with plotting by Roy Thomas but was never published, reflecting the later animosity between the two companies. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was not pleased that DC wanted the fourth company crossover to include the New Teen Titans, DC's best-selling title at the time, as he wanted the crossover to be the X-Men and the Legion of Super-Heroes. This led to Shooter's decision to stall and cancel the JLA/Avengers project.\nJustice League: Gods and Monsters is a  2015  direct-to-video  animated  superhero film  featuring an alternate universe version of the  DC Comics  superhero team the  Justice League  and is part of the  DC Universe Animated Original Movies .

With the  2011 relaunch  of its titles, DC Comics released a second volume of Justice League. In July 2016, the  DC Rebirth  initiative relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of Justice League. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various television programs and video games and is set to appear in the  live action film of the same name .\nSince then he showed up in various other stories playing games including against  Korvac ,  Kang the Conqueror , and the  Quasar  series. In 2004 the Grandmaster organized the meeting of the  Avengers  and the  Justice League  in an attempt to save the  Marvel Universe  from the  DC Comics  villain  Krona , when Krona came to the Marvel Universe seeking answers about the origin of creation. In an attempt to save his universe, Grandmaster challenged Krona to a game for the identity of a being in the Marvel Universe who had lived through the Big Bang by pitting the Avengers and the JLA against each other in a 'scavenger hunt' for twelve items of power- with Krona choosing the Avengers as his team-, only for Krona to turn on the Grandmaster when he lost due to  Captain America  helping  Batman  gain the  Cosmic Cube .

The  Grandmaster  tries to prevent Krona from destroying the Marvel Universe by revealing the existence of Galactus (a being who lived through the Big Bang, and can tell Krona what came before) and offering to play a game with Krona for the being's identity. As a result, the Justice League and the Avengers are manipulated into competing against each other to acquire twelve items of power from their respective universes, but although the League - serving as the Grandmaster's team - wins the conflict, Krona kills Galactus and the Grandmaster to obtain the knowledge he seeks (nearly destroying both universes despite the Grandmaster using the assembled items to briefly trap Krona) before the two teams can destroy Krona's equipment and his base, built from Galactus's remains, and allow the universes to be restored to their proper condition (including restoring Galactus and the Grandmaster to life).\nOther corporate superhero teams have been active in the  DC Comics  universe. The most well known are the  Conglomerate , the  Blood Pack ,  Power Company  and the  Captains of Industry .\nAlthough  Warner Brothers Animation 's  DC animated universe  was discontinued after the conclusion of  Justice League Unlimited  in 2006, the company continued with further series like  The Batman  and  Batman: The Brave and the Bold  which took a lighter thematic tone to the  DC Universe  adaptations. Currently, WB has returned to the DCAU franchise's more sophisticated standards with  Young Justice  with Greg Weisman producing.

Batman later creates the  Brother I  satellite surveillance system to watch over and if necessary, kill the other heroes. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the  Infinite Crisis  miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though at the very end Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.\nThe concept of a shared universe is one in which a multitude of different characters co-exist and/or interact. Typically this concept confines itself to one publishing company's output (although concepts such as the  Wold Newton family  extend the boundaries considerably), and it is most common in the main superhero universes of DC and Marvel. The benefit of having a shared universe is that characters can make (sales-boosting) guest appearances and allow for team-ups between different characters, as well as allowing the \"team\" concept (JLA, Avengers, etc.) to exist at all. Stan Lee's initial Marvel Universe creations in the 1960s best exemplify the \"shared universe\" concept, whereby characters (and villains) would feature across multiple titles, sometimes in the foreground of the story, sometimes as cameos in passing, but always underlining the interlinkedness of the universe.\n Demon Knights is a  DC Comics  title launched in 2011 as part of that company's line-wide title relaunch,  The New 52 .

Animation -produced  TV series   Legion of Super-Heroes  airing since fall 2006 on  The CW , which in turn is based on  the original DC super-team  of the same name appearing in various DC titles since 1958. The comic is set in the  DC Animated Universe  as opposed to the mainstream  DC Comics Universe , in which the original Legion exists; but, like the TV series, features stylized versions of characters from the original Legion. The comic is written by J. Torres, with art by Chynna Clugston-Flores.  The series ran for twenty issues.\nIn  JLA/Avengers , Ray appears first as taking the place of  Wally West  during the Justice League's mission to the  Marvel Universe  when he realizes that there is no  Speed Force  in the other reality. The Justice League arrives and battles a group of monsters while searching for the  Ultimate Nullifier , but Ray stays behind after a brief confrontation with the  Avengers , where he sees them meeting with  Metron  who gives a story different from the one given to the League by  The Grandmaster . Intrigued at this turn of events, Ray jumped on Metron's chair, which took him to the Grandmaster's base. When Batman and  Captain America  arrive, having tracked Metron with the aid of equipment provided by the  Fantastic Four , he shows them that while the Grandmaster is trying to stop  Krona , his team in his game is the League, rather than his own universe's Avengers. When the Grandmaster merges the universes to stop Krona, Ray disappears until the two teams join up to go after Krona himself. Ray participates in the battle and ends up disappearing after Krona's defeat.\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in  World's Finest Comics , starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different  DC Universe  superhero each month.\nOther corporate superhero teams have been active in the  DC Comics  universe. The most well known are the  Conglomerate ,  Power Company , the  Blood Pack , and  Hero Hotline .\nIn January 2013,  Guillermo del Toro  confirmed that he was working on a film with the working title Dark Universe, based on the DC Comics superhero team  Justice League Dark .

In May 2013, del Toro revealed that his script features Constantine, Swamp Thing,  Nimue Inwudu / Madame Xanadu , Deadman, and Zatanna as the team, with others \"in the mix.\" He also revealed that he was still waiting for the go-ahead from Warner Bros. Del Toro revealed in an interview that he hopes the DC Extended Universe will become as cohesive as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he added that if there was any correlation to that universe and this film, he would honor it. In November 2014, del Toro confirmed that the script was complete and that he had handed it in to Warner Bros. to be reviewed. In December 2014, del Toro revealed that the film would be a part of the DC Extended Universe. In June 2015, del Toro left the project. Though many of the characters of the Justice League Dark team began under DC's  Vertigo  imprint and Vertigo characters have been moved to Warner's  New Line Cinema  division (such as  The Sandman ), the Justice League Dark characters remain under Warner Bros. and the studio hopes to include them in future DC Extended Universe titles despite del Toro's exit.
