Del Toro was then searching for a screenwriter for the film. He revealed  Dr. Alec Holland / Swamp Thing,  John Constantine / Hellblazer,  Jim Corrigan / The Spectre,  Boston Brand / Deadman,  Zatanna Zatara, and her father  Giovanni Zatara  would be characters in the story, which would center around Constantine recruiting several of these characters. The film would not be an origin story, with each character already established and elements of their backstory coming into play throughout the film. In May 2013, del Toro revealed that his script features Constantine, Swamp Thing,  Nimue Inwudu / Madame Xanadu, Deadman, and Zatanna as the team, with others \"in the mix.\" He also revealed that he was still waiting for the go-ahead from Warner Bros. Del Toro revealed in an interview that he hopes the DC Extended Universe will become as cohesive as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he added that if there was any correlation to that universe and this film, he would honor it. In November 2014, del Toro confirmed that the script was complete and that he had handed it in to Warner Bros. to be reviewed. In December 2014, del Toro revealed that the film would be a part of the DC Extended Universe. In June 2015, del Toro left the project. Though many of the characters of the Justice League Dark team began under DC's  Vertigo  imprint and Vertigo characters have been moved to Warner's  New Line Cinema  division (such as  The Sandman ), the Justice League Dark characters remain under Warner Bros. and the studio hopes to include them in future DC Extended Universe titles despite del Toro's exit. Test footage for Swamp Thing was released online in July 2016.
