{"input_text": "Currently, there are ethical guidelines to be followed. The Stanford Prison Experiment led to the implementation of rules to preclude any harmful treatment of participants. Before they're implemented, human studies must now undergo an extensive review by an institutional review board (US) or ethics committee (UK) in accordance with the ethical guidelines by the American Psychological Association. These guidelines review whether the potential benefit for science outweighs the possible risk for physical and psychological harm.\nSocial psychology often employs the experimental method in an attempt to understand human social interaction.  Social psychology conducts its experiments both inside and outside of the laboratory. One notable social psychology experiment is the  Stanford prison experiment  conducted by  Philip Zimbardo  in 1971, although the extremity of this field experiment is not prototypical of the field. Another notable study is the  Stanley Milgram  obedience experiment, often known as the  Milgram experiment .\nP. van Lange, a  social psychologist  at the  Vrije Universiteit   Amsterdam  pointed out the similarity to the  Stanford Prison Experiment  (1971). In that experiment the participants were placed in a jail, where half played guards and the other half prisoners. In six days the experiment derailed. The guards became  aggressive ,  repressive  and  sadistic . They transformed into personalities outside their normal selves. \"From the Stanford-experiment may be concluded that human behavior is largely summoned by the local circumstances\", added his colleague J. van der Pligt, professor at the  Universiteit van Amsterdam .\"People get carried away,\" said A. Bergsma of Psychologie Magazine. \"Isolation becomes reality. They lose themselves in the experiment. There are no checks and balances. If there is no correction, they will derail one after another.\"  All experts agreed that the big reward for the winner increased the chance of accidents. But not all had a negative opinion. A. Lange, a professor of clinical psychology at the Universiteit van Amsterdam indicated that the program could produce certain insights not possible to achieve any more in socio-psychological research because the psychological well-being of the participant had been given greater importance. \"The  design  of the programme is the  wet dream  of a psychological researcher. Nowhere in the world an ethical commission will be found that would agree to such a design\", agreed psycho-physiologist A. Gaillard of the  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research .\nIn her analysis of the comics, Sharon Packer M.D. made connections between Cage's origin story and historical events taking place in the time of the comics' publication. Carl Lucas uses his newfound power to crash through the prison\u2019s cement barricades, he symbolically breaks through barriers that were once closed to him, similar to other black people of his era. Luke Cage\u2019s story has a distinct connection to unethical medical experiments; his comics presumably enhanced awareness of the  Tuskegee syphilis experiments  that made New York Times headlines in the very same month and year that Luke Cage debuted. Dr. Altman published a book on self-experimentation ethics, one of many texts discussing ethical breaches in medical experiments at that time, meaning that the Luke Cage stories likely picked up on the rhetoric on prison experiments during that time and tapped into opprobrium about ethics. Since his comics were released at the same time that the news broke about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on black men in Alabama, an event which caused public outrage and swayed public opinion against non-consenting or coercive human experimentation, it can be inferred that Luke Cage\u2019s story influenced some of the aforementioned public opinion.\nToday moral psychology is a thriving area of research in both philosophy and psychology, even at an  interdisciplinary  level.  For example, the psychologist  Lawrence Kohlberg  questioned boys and young men about their thought processes when they were faced with a  moral dilemma  producing one of many very useful empirical studies in the area of moral psychology. As another example, the philosopher  Joshua Knobe  recently completed an empirical study on how the way in which an ethical problem is phrased dramatically affects an individual's intuitions about the proper moral response to the problem. More conceptually focused research has been completed by researchers such as John Doris. Doris (2002) discusses the way in which  social psychological  experiments\u2014such as the  Stanford prison experiment s involving the idea of  situationism \u2014call into question a key component in  virtue ethics : the idea that individuals have a single, environment-independent moral character. As a further example,  Shaun Nichols  (2004) examines how empirical data on psychopathology suggests that  moral rationalism  is false.\nThe experiment presented several ethical issues, the most serious of which was that the experiment continued even when participants did not wish to continue. Despite the fact that participants were told they had the right to leave at any time, Zimbardo did not allow this during the experiment. Zimbardo was faced with the  ethical dilemma  that the experiment could possibly return outstanding results if continued, but it might also adversely affect the participants' well-being if not halted.\nMaslach graduated from  Radcliffe College  (1967) and earned a  Ph.D.  in Psychology at  Stanford University  (1971). Her evaluation of the  Stanford Prison Experiment  persuaded the investigator, her then future husband  Philip Zimbardo , to stop the experiment after only six days. In 1988\u201389, she was President of the Western Psychological Association; and, since 2001, she has been Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education at the  University of California, Berkeley .\nWhile most major controversies about unethical research were focused on biomedical sciences, there were also controversies involving behavioral, psychological, and sociological experiments such as: the  Milgram obedience experiment ,  Stanford prison experiment ,  Tearoom Trade  study, and others. There were also ethical issues related to the  CIA 's  Project MKULTRA .\nThe other classical study on obedience was conducted at  Stanford University  during the 1970s.  Phillip Zimbardo  was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the  Stanford Prison Experiment , college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of \"social forces\" on participants behavior. Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using  random assignment  half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing \"a psychological state of imprisonment\".\nSome of the guards' behaviour led to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. One third of the guards were judged to have exhibited \"genuine sadistic tendencies\", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized; five of them had to be removed from the experiment early. After Maslach confronted Zimbardo and forced him to realize that he had been passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his supervision, Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become grossly absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as grossly absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment. Ethical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to a  similar experiment , conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at  Yale University  by  Stanley Milgram .\nPerhaps most damning to the traditional view of character are the results of the experiments conducted by  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s and  Philip G. Zimbardo  in 1971. In the first of these experiments, the great majority of subjects, when politely though firmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what they thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming \"victim.\" In the second, the infamous  Stanford prison experiment , the planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life had to be ended after only six days because the college students who were assigned to act as guards became sadistic and those who were the \"prisoners\" became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. These and other experiments are taken to show that if humans do have noble tendencies, they are narrow, \"local\" traits that are not unified with other traits into a wider behavioral pattern of being.\nA post-experimental debriefing is now considered an important ethical consideration to ensure that participants are not harmed in any way by their experience in an experiment. Though Zimbardo did conduct debriefing sessions, they were several years after the Stanford Prison Experiment. By that time numerous details were forgotten; nonetheless, many participants reported that they experienced no lasting negative effects. However, the debriefing process  to assess what psychological harm, if any, may have been done and to rehabilitate participants, if necessary.\nHuman subject research legislation in the United States can be traced to the early 20th century.  Human subject research in the United States  was mostly unregulated until the 20th century, as it was throughout the world, until the establishment of various governmental and professional regulations and  codes of ethics . Notable \u2013 and in some cases, notorious \u2013 human subject experiments performed in the US include the  Tuskegee syphilis experiment ,  human radiation experiments , the  Milgram obedience experiment  and  Stanford prison experiment s and  Project MKULTRA . With growing public awareness of such experimentation, and the evolution of professional ethical standards, such research became regulated by various legislation, most notably, those that introduced and then empowered the  institutional review board s.\nStanford University  psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  conducts a  psychological experiment  to test the hypothesis that the personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior between them. In the experiment, Zimbardo selects fifteen male students to participate in a 14-day prison simulation to take roles as prisoners or guards. They receive $15 per day. The experiment is conducted in a mock prison located in the basement of Jordan Hall, the university's psychology department building. The students who are guards become abusive, as does Zimbardo himself. Two students who play the role of prisoners quit the experiment early, and Zimbardo abruptly stops the entire experiment after only six days.\nIn the summer of 1971 a Stanford psychology professor,  Philip Zimbardo , conducted a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard which is known as the  Stanford prison experiment . The experiment, which was funded by the  Office of Naval Research , surprised the professor by the authoritarian and brutal reaction of the \"guards\" and the passive acceptance of abuse by the \"prisoners\". The experiment was criticized as unethical and was a partial cause of the development of ethical guidelines for experiments involving human subjects.\nIn 1971,  Stanford University   psychologist   Philip Zimbardo  conducted the  Stanford prison experiment  in which twenty-four male students were randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. The participants adapted to their roles beyond Zimbardo's expectations with prison guards exhibiting  authoritarian  status and psychologically abusing the prisoners who were passive in their acceptance of the abuse. The experiment was largely controversial with criticisms aimed toward the lack of scientific principles and a control group, and for ethical concerns regarding Zimbardo's lack of intervention in the prisoner abuse.\nThe practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g.,  role-playing ) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the  Milgram experiment  and  Stanford prison experiment ), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.\nSocial psychology conducts its experiments both inside and outside of the laboratory. One notable social psychology experiment is the Stanford prison experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, although the extremity of this field experiment is not prototypical of the field.Another notable study is the Stanley Milgram obedience experiment, often known as the Milgram experiment.n the latter half of the 20th century, the phrase experimental psychology had shifted in meaning due to the expansion of psychology as a discipline and the growth in the size and number of its sub-disciplines.\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) by Phil Zimbardo has been for me an example of the astonishing things that we humans are capable of.I guess as an example of human gullibility, I had not been skeptical about the experiment, which lacks quite a few scientific markers (aside from its ethical problems).he Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) by Phil Zimbardo has been for me an example of the astonishing things that we humans are capable of.\nRight from the start of the Stanford Prison Experiment there were ethical issues at stake. The participants were not given all the facts about what exactly they were signing and consent forms were not properly completed.\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted by Professor Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University in 1971 and was designed to explore the psychological impact of the prison environment on prisoners and prison guards.ut despite overwhelming evidence pointing to the immorality of the experiment, it was not until Zimbardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s girlfriend of the time, graduate student Christine Maslach, expressed concerns about the conditions inside the prison that the experiment was aborted.", "key": "37_4", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.047736", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
