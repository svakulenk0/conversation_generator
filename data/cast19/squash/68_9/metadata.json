{"input_text": "Maltagliati () are a type of  pasta  typical product to the  Emilia-Romagna  region of  Italy .\nA special devotion to St. Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of  Lombardy ,  Emilia-Romagna ,  Veneto ,  Friuli Venezia Giulia ,  Trentino-Alto Adige , in the North of the country, and  Sicily  and  Calabria , in the South, as well as in Croatian coastal region of  Dalmatia . The feast is a Catholic-celebrated holiday with roots that can be traced to Sicily. On 13th of every December it is celebrated with large traditional feasts of home made pasta and various other Italian dishes, with a special dessert of wheat in hot chocolate milk. The large grains of soft wheat are representative of her eyes and are a treat only to be indulged in once a year.\nEmilia-Romagna's intensive farming economy in the northern region of Italy results in plentiful dairy and meat products, and their commonality in regional cooking \u2013 more so than the olive oil found in southern regions of Italy. Pastas from Emilia-Romagna and its capital, Bologna, are almost always served with a  rag\u00f9 , a thick sauce made from ingredients such as onions, carrots, finely ground pork and beef, celery, butter, and tomatoes.\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's  prosciutto ,  culatello  and  Felino salami , Piacenza's  pancetta ,  coppa  and salami, Bologna's  mortadella  and  salame rosa , Modena's  zampone ,  cotechino  and  cappello del prete   and  Ferrara 's  salama da sugo .  Reggio Emilia  is famous for its fresh egg-made pasta  cappelletti  (similar to Bologna's tortellini but differing in size), the typical  erbazzone  a spinach and  Parmigiano Reggiano  salted cake and its  Gnocco Fritto  some kind of mixed flour stripes fried in boiling oil, enjoyed in combination with ham or salami.  Crescentina  best known as  tigella  is the typical thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena and it is usually filled in with the typical cunza (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include  zuppa inglese  (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and  Alchermes  liqueur) and  panpepato  (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include  Sangiovese  from Romagna,  Lambrusco  from  Reggio Emilia  or  Modena ,  Cagnina di Romagna ,  Gutturnio  and  Trebbiano  from  Piacenza .\nIn  Northern Italy  though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so. Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes; basil (found in  pesto ), nuts and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham ( prosciutto ), sausage ( cotechino ), different sorts of  salami , truffles,  grana ,  Parmigiano-Reggiano , and  tomato es ( Bolognese sauce  or  rag\u00f9 ).\nTomato sauce (also known as Neapolitan sauce, and referred to in Italy as Napoletana sauce), refers to any of a very large number of sauces made primarily from  tomato es, usually to be served as part of a  dish  (rather than as a  condiment ). Tomato sauces are common for  meat  and  vegetable s, but they are perhaps best known as sauces for  pasta  dishes.\nFarfalle () are a type of  pasta  commonly known as bow-tie pasta. The name is derived from the  Italian  word farfalla ( butterfly ). The 'e' at the end of the word is the Italian feminine plural ending, making the meaning of the word \"butterflies\".  In the Italian city of  Modena , farfalle are known as strichetti.  A larger variation of farfalle is known as farfallone, while the miniature version is called farfalline.  Farfalle date back to the 16th century in the  Lombardy  and  Emilia-Romagna  regions of  Northern Italy .\nPasta () is a  staple food  of traditional  Italian cuisine , with the first reference dating to 1154 in  Sicily . It is also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta  dishes . Typically, pasta is a  noodle  made from an  unleavened   dough  of a  durum wheat   flour  mixed with water or  eggs  and formed into sheets or various shapes, then  cooked  by  boiling  or  baking . It can also be made with flour from other  cereal s or  grains . Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).\nThe traditional main course is  pasta , which includes regular pasta, pasta in broth and baked pasta, prepared in many different shapes. Almost all of pasta dishes require a base of \u201csfoglia\u201d, a dough of eggs and flour, handmade with a rolling pin. First courses include  cappelletti ,  passatelli  in broth,  lasagne ,  cannelloni , nidi di rondine,  ravioli ,  tagliatelle ,  garganelli ,  maltagliati ,  gnocchi  and  strozzapreti , seasoned with  bolognese sauce  or a  dressing  of  butter  and  sage .\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\nOriginally spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the latter half of the 20th century and now spaghetti is most commonly available in  lengths. A variety of pasta  dishes  are based on it.\nStrozzapreti (; \"priest-choker\" or \"priest-strangler\"  in  Italian ) are an elongated form of  cavatelli , or hand-rolled  pasta  typical of the  Emilia-Romagna ,  Tuscany ,  Marche  and  Umbria  regions of Italy as well as in the state of  San Marino . The name is also used for a baked cheese and vegetable dumpling, prepared in some regions of Italy and in the French island of  Corsica .\nSince Naples was the capital of the  Kingdom of Naples , its cuisine took much from the culinary traditions of all the  Campania  region, reaching a balance between dishes based on rural ingredients ( pasta , vegetables,  cheese ) and seafood dishes ( fish ,  crustacean s,  mollusk s). A vast variety of recipes is influenced by the local aristocratic cuisine, like  timballo  and the , pasta or rice dishes with very elaborate preparation, while the dishes coming from the popular traditions contain poor but nutritionally healthy ingredients, like  pasta e fagioli  (pasta with beans) and other pasta dishes with vegetables.\nNorthern Italy, mountainous in many parts, is notable for the alpine cheeses of the Valle d'Aosta, the  pesto  of Liguria, and, in Piedmonte, the Alba truffle. In the Alto Adige, the influence of neighboring Austria may be found in a regional repertoire that includes speck and dumplings. In the north,  risotto  and  polenta  have tended to serve the staple function taken by pasta across the rest of the country. Italy's center includes the celebrated culinary regions of Tuscany \u2014 famous for its olive oil and bean dishes \u2014 and Emilia-Romagna \u2014 home of  prosciutto di Parma ,  parmigiano-reggiano , and  rag\u00f9  \u2014 the latter now produced (and traduced) worldwide as spaghetti alla bolognese. Southern Italy includes the hearty food of Lazio in which meat and offal frequently figure, but also the vegetable-focused fare of Basilicata, historically one of Italy's poorest regions. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia have distinctively different foodways. The former is notable for its many sweet dishes, seafood, and citrus fruit, while Sardinian cuisine has traditionally looked to its hilly interior with a cuisine centered on lamb, sucking pig, breads, and  pecorino sardo . It is in the food of Naples and Campania, however, that many visitors would recognize the foods that have come to be regarded as quintessentially Italian:  pizza , spaghetti with  tomato sauce , aubergine  parmigiana  (but the origins of the two last dishes are claimed by Sicily).\nBologna is renowned for its culinary tradition. It has given its name to the well-known  Bolognese sauce , a meat based pasta sauce called in Italy  rag\u00f9  alla bolognese but in the city itself just rag\u00f9 as in  Tagliatelle  al rag\u00f9. Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured  pork  meats such as  prosciutto ,  mortadella  and  salumi  is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include  Pignoletto  dei Colli Bolognesi,  Lambrusco  di Modena and  Sangioves e di Romagna.  Tagliatelle  with  rag\u00f9 ,  lasagne ,  tortellini  served in broth, and mortadella, the original  Bologna sausage , are among the local specialties. Traditional Bolognese desserts are often linked to holidays, such as fave dei morti, multi-coloured almond paste cookies made for  All Saints' Day , jam-filled raviole cookies that are served on  Saint Joseph's Day , and carnival sweets known as sfrappole, a light and delicate fried pastry topped with powder sugar. Torta di riso, a custard-like cake made of almonds, rice and amaretto, is made throughout the year.\nMediterranean  Italian cuisine  includes much of Italy outside the north and the mountainous inland regions. It is a diverse cuisine, but among its best-known and most characteristic foods are  risotto ,  pizza  in  Neapolitan  and  Sicilian style s, and  pasta  dishes such as  spaghetti .\nTraditional cuisine remains a strong part of Cadelbosco's identity, which takes its influence from Emilia-Romagna's authentic dishes such as tortelli di zucca, erbazzone, gnocco fritto, homemade pasta,  zampone  and  cotechino  with beans, pork and rabbit meat.  Parmigiano-Reggiano  cheese and  Lambrusco  wine are also a major part of the cuisine.\nEmilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regards to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour.  Bologna  is notable for pasta dishes like  tortellini ,  lasagne ,  gramigna  and  tagliatelle  which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations.  The  Romagna  subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like,  garganelli ,  strozzapreti ,  sfoglia lorda  and  tortelli alla lastra . In the  Emilia  subregion, except  Piacenza  which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of  Lombardy , rice is eaten to a lesser extent.  Polenta , a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated  balsamic vinegar  is made only in the Emilian cities of  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia , following legally binding traditional procedures.  Parmigiano Reggiano  (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while  Grana Padano  variety is produced in the rest of the region.\nAnari , from Greek (\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03ae) is a crumbly fresh  whey cheese , similar to  ricotta , made from goat or sheep milk. Two varieties exist, dry and fresh anari. Dry anari is salted and is much harder than the fresh variety, and is served grated with pasta dishes and  Giouvetsi , while fresh anari is eaten in slices with honey or carob syrup.\nEmilia-Romagna  is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. The  Romagna  subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like  cappelletti ,  garganelli ,  strozzapreti , sfoglia lorda and tortelli alla lastra or very peculiar cheese like  squacquerone ,  piada  snacks are famous worldwide.\nPasta is sometimes boiled before it is baked in al forno dishes. This double cooking means that it is served soft, not with the firm  al dente  consistency that some Italians prefer in pasta dishes.\nThe dish is prepared in a dome or  springform pan  and eggs or cheese are used as a binder.  Rice is commonly used as an ingredient in  Emilia-Romagna , where the dish is referred to as a bomba and baked with a filling of pigeon or other game bird, peas, local cheese and a base of dried pasta.  Cr\u00eapes  are used as a base in  Abruzzo , and other regions use  ravioli  or  gnocchi . In  Sicily , it's typically made with pasta and  eggplant .\nIn the plains it is very popular to serve grilled meat (often by a  barbecue , and in a mix of pork, beef and chicken meat) together with grilled polenta, potatoes or vegetables. Other popular dishes include  risotto , rice cooked with many different kinds of food, from vegetables, mushrooms, pumpkin or  radicchio   to seafood, pork meat or chicken livers.  Bigoli  (a typical Venetian fresh  pasta , similar to  Udon ),  fettuccine  (hand-made  noodles ),  ravioli  and the similar tortelli (filled with meat, cheese, vegetables or pumpkin) and gnocchi (potatoes-made fresh pasta), are fresh and often hand-made pasta dishes (made of eggs and  wheat flour ), served together with meat sauce (rag\u00f9) often made with duck meat, sometimes together with mushrooms or peas, or simply with melted butter.\nCuisine from the mountain areas is mainly made of pork or  game  meat, with polenta, as well as mushrooms or cheeses (made by cow milk), and some dish from  Austria n or  Tyrolese  tradition, such as  canederli  or  strudel . A typical dish is  casunziei , hand-made fresh pasta similar to ravioli.\nAside from the typical Italian cuisine like pizza, pasta, risotto, panettone, milanesa, polenta, calzone, ossobuco and others, Italians helped to create new dishes that today are typically Brazilians. Galeto(from the Italian Galletto, little rooster), Frango com Polenta (Chicken with fried Polenta),Bife \u00e0 parmegiana(a steak prepared with  Parmigiano-Reggiano ),  Catupiry  cheese, new types of sausage like Lingui\u00e7a Calabresa and Lingui\u00e7a Toscana (literally Calabrian and Tuscan Sausage), Chocotone (Panettone with chocolate chips) and many others recipes were created or influenced by the Italian community.\nAs a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes. As pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta) cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment. A second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno in which the pasta incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked.\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc.  In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or  baccal\u00e0 ), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients.

They are commonly home-made and are typical of the culinary tradition of the  Dolomites  area, in the north-eastern part of  Italy , especially the provinces of  Belluno ,  Vicenza , and  Verona .\nPasta and cheese casseroles have been recorded as early as the 14th century in the Italian cookbook by Brian  Liber de Coquina , one of the oldest medieval cookbooks, which featured a dish of parmesan and pasta. A cheese and pasta casserole known as makerouns was recorded in the famous medieval English cookbook, the  Forme of Cury , which was also written in the 14th century. It was made with fresh, hand-cut pasta which was sandwiched between a mixture of melted butter and cheese.

Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in  Trentino-Alto Adige  and  Emilia Romagna . In Bologna, the meat-based  Bolognese sauce  incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called  pesto  originates from Genoa. In  Central Italy , there are sauces such as  tomato sauce ,  amatriciana ,  arrabbiata  and the egg-based  carbonara .Tomato sauces are also present in  Southern Italian  cuisine, where they originated.
