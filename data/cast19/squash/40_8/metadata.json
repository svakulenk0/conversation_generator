Joshua Martin had written after an interview with Hayley Williams, \"The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently. It's sped up, and slowed down. It's emo without being whiny, or bratty. Almost a very literal anti- Avril Lavigne .\"  Alternative Press  magazine had commented that the band was \"young sounding\", while consistently being \"honest.\" Paramore's first album All We Know is Falling had an arguably more \"formulaic pop-punk\" sound that was \"delivered particularly well\" and the combination of the two had created a \"refined rock infused pop/punk album.\" The band's second release, Riot! was said to explore a 'diverse range of styles,\" however, not straying far from \"their signature sound.\"\nWhile emo originated in  hardcore punk  and has been considered a subgenre of  post-hardcore , it has also been associated with  indie rock  and  pop punk . The fusion of emo with pop punk is also known as  emo pop . According to  AllMusic , \"some emo leans toward the  progressive  side, full of complex guitar work, unorthodox song structures, arty noise, and extreme dynamic shifts; some emo is much closer to punk-pop, though it's a bit more intricate\". Lyrics, which are a key focus in the genre, are typically emotional and often personal, dealing with topics such as failed romance; AllMusic described emo lyrics as \"usually either free-associative poetry or intimate confessionals\". According to AllMusic, early emo bands were hardcore bands that \"favored expressive vocals over the typical barking rants\" of regular hardcore and most 1990s emo bands \"borrowed from some combination of  Fugazi ,  Sunny Day Real Estate , and  Weezer \".  The New York Times  described as emo as \"emotional  punk  or post-hardcore or pop-punk. That is, punk that wears its heart on its sleeve and tries a little tenderness to leaven its sonic attack. If it helps, imagine  Ricky Nelson  singing in the  Sex Pistols .\" Author Matt Diehl described emo as a \"more sensitive interpolation of punk's mission\".\nA new wave of pop punk groups had sprung up sometime around 2010. Dave Beech of  Clash  noted that these groups were \"[d]arker and more mature\" than those previously, taking  influence \"and occasional indifference\" from  1990s emo . On  The Wonder Years '  The Upsides  (2010), vocalist Dan Campbell sung about \"His early twenties soul-searching and tales of strife\" which \"resonated with a [new] generation, inspiring countless imitators in the process.\" This pushed Campbell to \"the forefront of a new wave\", and the album influencing a new wave of pop punk bands.  The Story So Far 's second album,  What You Don't See  (2013), \"cemented their place at the top table of nu pop-punk\".  Rock Sound  included The Wonder Years'  The Greatest Generation  on their best albums of 2013 list, calling it \"the defining album of what may well have been the genre's best year for a decade.\" Kerrang! said the album \"ripped up the pop-punk blueprint\" pushing the genre to \"new peaks of invention, both lyrically and musically.\" In early 2014, Welsh band  Neck Deep  released their debut album  Wishful Thinking , which Rock Sound later called it \"the greatest UK pop-punk record of all time.\" Also in 2014, Australian band  5 Seconds of Summer 's  self titled album  debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and in many other countries, prompting Alternative Press to describe the band as important to the marketing of the pop-punk scene.\nAlternative Press  writer Colin McGuire noted that Through Being Cool influenced a new wave of pop-punk bands, such as  Fall Out Boy ,  My Chemical Romance , and  Taking Back Sunday . Alternative Press also included the album on their list of the most influential albums of 1999. Tris McCall of  NJ.com  listed the album as \"every third-wave emo band's inspiration [...] [sending] a shockwave through the pop-punk underground.\"  NME  listed the album was one of 20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic.  BuzzFeed  included it at number 5 on its list of 36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F\u2014\u2014ing Die. The album was included in  Rock Sound s 101 Modern Classics list at number 60, with the notation that \"pop-punk has not been the same since [1999], and this record plays a major role in that change.\" Fall Out Boy vocalist  Patrick Stump  listed the album at number 10 on his list of 10 Records That Changed My Life. Stumped revealed that he wouldn't \"have been in Fall Out Boy if it weren't for this record\". The album's artwork was included by  Fuse.tv  as one of 20 Iconic Pop Punk Album Covers.  Stereogum  listed \"Rocks Tonic Juice Magic\" as one of 30 Essential Songs From The Golden Era of Emo.\nAs emo became more successful in the mid-1990s due to the rise of  grunge , emo pop was set as blueprints by bands such as  The Wrens , which pioneered a form of emo-pop on 1996's  Secaucus , and  Weezer , which in 1996 released the definitive emo album  Pinkerton . Other bands which put out releases in the 90s to set up the blueprints for  emo pop  included  Sense Field ,  Jejune ,  Alkaline Trio  and  The Get Up Kids . As emo became commercially successful in the early 2000s, the emo pop movement was birthed by Jimmy Eat World's 2001 release  Bleed American  and the success of that album's single \"The Middle\". Bands like  Weezer  and  The Wrens  both saw great success in this new movement, the former with its release  The Green Album  and the latter with  Meadowlands , which reinvented  punk-pop  for the new generation.", "key": "40_8", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.077556", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
