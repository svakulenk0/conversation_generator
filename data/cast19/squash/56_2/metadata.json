{"input_text": "The most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck ; based on the  inheritance of acquired characteristics  (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist  Charles Darwin , combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell,  Thomas Malthus 's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on  natural selection ; similar evidence led  Alfred Russel Wallace  to independently reach the same conclusions.  Charles Darwin 's early interest in nature led him on a  five-year voyage  on  which established him as an eminent  geologist  whose observations and theories supported  Charles Lyell 's  uniformitarian  ideas, and publication of his  journal of the voyage  made him famous as a popular author. Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and  fossil s he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the  transmutation of species  and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when  Alfred Russel Wallace  sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of  both of their theories .Darwin's  On the Origin of Species , published on 24 November 1859, a seminal work of scientific literature, was to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.\nIn the first episode  Richard Dawkins  explains the basic mechanisms of  natural selection , and tells the story of how  Charles Darwin  developed his theory.\nThe decades before the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been described as  the eclipse of Darwinism . Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the mechanism of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were  neo-Lamarckism  (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution),  orthogenesis  (\"straight-line\" evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of  Mendelism  and  Hugo De Vries '  mutation theory . Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term  Darwinism  had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of  August Weismann  who went further than Darwin by rejecting  inheritance of acquired characters  and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called  neo-Darwinism . By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the  modern evolutionary synthesis , which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism.\nEvolutionary psychology has its historical roots in  Charles Darwin 's theory of natural selection. In The Origin of Species, Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis:Two of his later books were devoted to the study of animal emotions and psychology;  The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex  in 1871 and  The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals  in 1872. Darwin's work inspired  William James 's functionalist approach to psychology. Darwin's theories of evolution, adaptation, and natural selection have provided insight into why brains function the way they do.\nRomanes's and Darwin's relationship developed quickly and they became close friends. This relationship began when Romanes became Darwin's research assistant during the last eight years of Darwin\u2019s life. The association Romanes had with Darwin was essential in Darwin's later works. Therefore, Darwin confided volumes of unpublished work which Romanes later used to publish papers. Like Darwin, Romanes's theories were met with skepticism and were not accepted initially. The majority of Romanes's work attempted to make a connection between  animal consciousness  and  human consciousness . Some problems were encountered during his research that he addressed with the development of  physiological selection . This was Romanes's answer to three objections to Darwin\u2019s  isolation theory  of speciation. These were: species characteristics that have no evolutionary purpose; the widespread fact of inter-specific sterility; and the need for varieties to escape the swamping effects of inter-crossing after permanent species are established. At the end of his career the majority of his work was directed towards the development of a relationship between intelligence and placement on an evolutionary tree. Romanes believed that the further along an organism was on an evolutionary standpoint, the more likely that organism would be to possess a higher level of functioning.\nDarwin's theory succeeded in profoundly altering scientific opinion regarding the development of life and in producing a small philosophical revolution. However, this theory could not explain several critical components of the evolutionary process. Specifically, Darwin was unable to explain the source of variation in traits within a species, and could not identify a mechanism that could pass traits faithfully from one generation to the next. Darwin's  hypothesis  of  pangenesis , while relying in part on the inheritance of acquired characteristics, proved to be useful for statistical models of evolution that were developed by his cousin  Francis Galton  and the \"biometric\" school of evolutionary thought. However, this idea proved to be of little use to other biologists.\nOwen was finding unexpected relationships from the fossils: the batch included the horse sized  Scelidotherium  which appeared to be closely allied to the  anteater , a gigantic  ground sloth , and an ox-sized armoured  armadillo  which he called  Glyptodon . The  Patagonia n spine and leg bones from  Port St Julian  which Darwin had thought might be from a  Mastodon  were apparently from a gigantic  guanaco  or  Llama , or perhaps  camel , which Owen named  Macrauchenia . Lyell saw a \"law of succession\" with mammals being replaced by their own kind on each continent, and on 17 February used his presidential address at the Geographical Society to present Owen's findings to date on Darwin's fossils, pointing out this inference that extinct species were related to current species in the same locality. He invited Darwin to come along, and the speech drew Darwin's attention to the question of why past and present species in one place should be so closely related. At the same meeting Darwin was elected to the Council of the Society. For Lyell this was \"a glorious addition to my society of geologists\", gentlemen (and amateurs of independent means) with duty only to scientific integrity, social stability and responsible religion, for Darwin it meant joining the respectable \u00e9lite of eminent geologists developing a science dealing with the age of the earth and the Days of Creation.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s,  Mendel's  theory of inheritance and Darwin's theory of evolution by  natural selection  were joined in what was called the  modern evolutionary synthesis . This conjunction of theories also had a large impact on how biologists think about species.  Edward Poulton  anticipated many ideas on species that today are well accepted, and that were later more fully developed by  Theodosius Dobzhansky  and  Ernst Mayr , two of the architects of the modern synthesis. Dobzhansky's 1937 book articulated the genetic processes that occur when incipient species are beginning to diverge. In particular, Dobzhansky described the critical role, for the formation of new species, of the evolution of  reproductive isolation .\nA favourite walk took the Darwin family to a spot above the quiet  Cudham  valley, teeming with orchids including  Cephalanthera ,  Neottia ,  Fly Orchid s and  Musk Orchid s. They called this place \"Orchis Bank\", and the whole family became involved in Darwin's researches. Darwin observed orchids every summer, but in twenty years, only on two occasions (when he noticed butterflies \"sucking  O. pyramidalis  and  Gymnadenia \") did he see insects visiting flowers.In 1854, Darwin began to work full-time on the origin of species. He examined orchids and counted how often one or both  pollinia  (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects. He experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as  Fabaceae , they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to  empirical research  on orchids. Despite delays caused by  recurring illness , he made progress on writing his planned \"Big Book\" on evolution, but when  Alfred Russel Wallace 's letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of  natural selection  in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote  On the Origin of Species  as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859. In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of \"intercrossing\", and noted: \"Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them\". He introduced his new concept, the process of  coevolution , describing the co-adaptation of  bumblebee s and  red clover , and speculating \"how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure\". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern  biology . The concept, published by Darwin and  Alfred Russel Wallace  in a  joint presentation of papers in 1858 , was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life , which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional  Darwinian evolution  with subsequent discoveries in  classical genetics  formed the  modern evolutionary synthesis  of the mid-20th century. The addition of  molecular genetics  has led to  evolutionary developmental biology , which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random  genetic drift , natural selection remains the primary explanation for  adaptive evolution .\n is a term of Japanese origin, which refers to an isolated development branch of a globally available product. The term is used as an analogy to a part of  Charles Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species .  Darwin encountered in the  Gal\u00e1pagos Islands  isolated flora and fauna, which led to evolutionary changes. This phenomenon was a key to the development of  evolutionary theory . Darwin stated that in the biological isolation species have evolved to develop different characteristics, allowing adaptation making them more viable in the local environment. Similarly, a development of goods \"in relative isolation from the rest of the world because of a focus on the local market\" can lead to similarly differing products.\nDarwin's ideas developed rapidly from the return in 1836 of  The Voyage of the Beagle . By December 1838 he had developed the principles of his theory, but was conscious of the need to answer all likely objections before publishing.  While he continued with research, he had an immense amount of work in hand analysing and publishing findings from the Beagle expedition, and was repeatedly delayed by illness.\nIn the late 19th century the term  neo-Lamarckism  came to be associated with the position of  naturalists  who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic  Samuel Butler , the German biologist  Ernst Haeckel , the  American   paleontologist s  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Alpheus Hyatt , and the American  entomologist   Alpheus Packard . They considered Lamarckism to be more progressive and thus philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of natural selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. The idea of linear progress was an important part of Haeckel's  recapitulation theory  of evolution, which held that the  embryo logical development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Cope and Hyatt looked for, and thought they found, patterns of linear progression in the  fossil record . Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics. Packard also wrote a book about Lamarck and his writings.\nThe publication of  Darwin 's  The Origin of Species  in 1859 introduced  human evolution . However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in \" social Darwinism \" theories.  Herbert Spencer , who coined the term \" survival of the fittest ,\" or  Lewis Henry Morgan  in  Ancient Society  (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These 19th-century  unilineal evolution  theories claimed that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more  civilised  over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.\nPerhaps the most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of  evolution  by  natural selection  put forward by the British naturalist  Charles Darwin  in his book  On the Origin of Species  in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both  opposition and support  from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of \"man's place in the universe\". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the  Moravia n monk  Gregor Mendel  in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of  genetics , which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953,  James D. Watson ,  Francis Crick  and  Maurice Wilkins  clarified the basic structure of DNA, the  genetic material  for expressing life in all its forms. In the late 20th century, the possibilities of  genetic engineering  became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human  genome  (the  Human Genome Project ).\nCharles Darwin and the Tree of Life is a 2009 television documentary about  Charles Darwin  and his revolutionary theory of  evolution  through  natural selection , produced by the  BBC  to mark the bicentenary of Darwin's birth. It is part of the  BBC Darwin Season . The presenter,  David Attenborough , outlines the development of the theory by Darwin through his observations of animals and plants in nature and in the domesticated state, visiting sites important in Darwin's own life, including  Down House ,  Cambridge University  and the  Natural History Museum , and using archive footage from Attenborough's many  nature documentaries  for the BBC.  He reviews the development of the theory since its beginnings, and its revolutionary impact on the way in which humans view themselves - not as having dominion over the animals as  The Bible  says, but as part of the natural world and subject to the same controlling forces that govern all life on  Earth .\nGregor Mendel , an Austrian scientist and Augustinian friar, began experimenting with peas around 1856. Mendel had joined the  Brno  Augustinian Monastery in 1843, but also trained as a scientist at the Olmutz Philosophical Institute and the  University of Vienna . The Brno Monastery was a centre of scholarship, with an extensive library and tradition of scientific research. Observing the processes of pollination at his monastery in modern Czechoslovakia, Mendel studied and developed theories pertaining to the field of science now called  genetics . Mendel published his results in 1866 in the Journal of the Brno Natural History Society, and is considered the father of modern genetics.  Where  Charles Darwin 's theories suggested a mechanism for improvement of species over generations, Mendel's observations provided explanation for how a new species itself could emerge. Though Darwin and Mendel never collaborated, they were aware of each other's work (Darwin read a paper by  Wilhelm Olbers Focke  which extensively referenced Mendel).  Bill Bryson  wrote that \"without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life sciences in the twentieth century. Darwin saw that all living things are connected, that ultimately they trace their ancestry to a single, common source; Mendel's work provided the mechanism to explain how that could happen\".\nThe crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by  An Essay on the Principle of Population  (1798) by  Thomas Robert Malthus , Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a \"struggle for existence\" in which favorable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism. Darwin developed his theory of \"natural selection\" from 1838 onwards and was writing up his \"big book\" on the subject when  Alfred Russel Wallace  sent him a version of virtually the same theory in 1858. Their  separate papers  were presented together at a 1858 meeting of the  Linnean Society of London . At the end of 1859, Darwin's publication of his \"abstract\" as On the Origin of Species explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of  concepts of evolution .  Thomas Henry Huxley  applied Darwin's ideas to  human s, using  paleontology  and  comparative anatomy  to provide strong evidence that humans and  ape s shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the  universe .\nAlthough Delbr\u00fcck's  Rockefeller Foundation  fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with  Vanderbilt University  in  Nashville, Tennessee , where from 1940 to 1947 he taught  physics , yet had his laboratory in the biology department.  In 1941, Delbr\u00fcck met  Salvador Luria  of  Indiana University  who began visiting Vanderbilt.  In 1942,  Delbr\u00fcck and Luria published  on  bacteria l resistance to  virus  infection mediated by random  mutation .   Alfred Hershey  of  Washington University  began visiting in 1943. The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel\u2019s experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin\u2019s theory was provided when Thomas Morgan Hunt discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin\u2019s ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code.\nCharles Darwin  was a natural theologist who studied around the world, and most importantly in the  Galapagos Islands . Darwin introduced the idea of natural selection, as he theorized against previously accepted ideas that species were static or unchanging. His contributions to biogeography and the theory of evolution were different from those of other explorers of his time, because he developed a mechanism to describe the ways that species changed. His influential ideas include the development of theories regarding the struggle for existence and natural selection. Darwin\u2019s theories started a biological segment to biogeography and empirical studies, which enabled future scientists to develop ideas about the geographical distribution of organisms around the globe.\nCharles Darwin  used the phrase \"struggle for existence\" in a broader sense, and chose the term as the title to the third chapter of  On the Origin of Species  published in 1859. Using Malthus\u2019s idea of the struggle for existence, Darwin was able to develop his view of adaptation, which was highly influential in the formulation of the theory of natural selection. In addition, Alfred Wallace independently used the concept of the struggle for existence to help come to the same theory of evolution. Later,  T.H. Huxley  further developed the idea of the struggle for existence. Huxley did not fully agree with Darwin on natural selection, but he did agree that there was a struggle for existence in nature. Huxley also recognized that a struggle for existence existed between competing ideas within the minds of people engaged in intellectual discussion. This view is an early example of what was later described as  meme  theory.\nDarwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book  On the Origin of Species , overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of  transmutation of species . By the 1870s, the  scientific community  and much of the general public had accepted  evolution as a fact . However, many favoured  competing explanations  and it was not until the emergence of the  modern evolutionary synthesis  from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the  life sciences , explaining the  diversity of life .\nIn the 1920s and 1930s a modern evolutionary synthesis connected natural selection, mutation theory, and Mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis was able to explain patterns observed across species in populations, through  fossil transitions  in palaeontology, and even complex cellular mechanisms in  developmental biology . The publication of the structure of  DNA  by  James Watson  and  Francis Crick  in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.  Molecular biology  improved our understanding of the relationship between  genotype  and  phenotype . Advancements were also made in  phylogenetic   systematics , mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of  evolutionary trees . In 1973, evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky  penned that \" nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" because it has brought to light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent  explanatory  body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet.\nIt has been said that of all the books that Gould wrote in his career, \"the one with the most impact is probably Ontogeny and Phylogeny ... to say that this work is a hallmark in this area of evolutionary theory would be an understatement. It proved to be the catalyst for much of the future work in the field, and to a large degree was the inspiration for the modern field of 'evolutionary developmental biology'. Gould's hope was to show that the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny is fundamental to evolution, and at its heart is a simple premise\u2014that variations in the timing and rate of development provide the raw material upon which natural selection can operate.\"\nThe work is an examination of  naturalist   Charles Darwin  and the  theory  of  evolution  he proposed and marshaled evidence for in  The Origin of Species . A brief account of his visit to the  Gal\u00e1pagos Islands  brings up the issue of  human origins , leading into a discussion of early theories on the formation and age of the earth and evolution. A biographical sketch of Darwin follows, covering his youth, his naturalistic studies on the voyage of the  Beagle  and subsequent life, focusing on his scientific researches and writings. The history of the theory of human evolution as currently understood is then presented, with sections on the work of  Mendel , the development of the science of  genetics , and the  Scopes Trial . It includes a selected bibliography and index.\nOne of the first and most important naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the  X Club  to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with  naturalism  and to end the domination of British  natural science  by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of  Archaeopteryx  in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in  North America . Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as  France , and the countries of southern Europe and  Latin America  was slower. An exception to this was  Germany , where both  August Weismann  and  Ernst Haeckel  championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.\nDarwin's ideas developed rapidly from the return in 1836 of  the Beagle survey expedition . By December 1838 he had developed the principles of his theory. At that time similar ideas brought others disgrace and association with the revolutionary mob. He was conscious of the need to answer all likely objections before publishing.  While he continued with research as his \"prime hobby\", his priority was an immense amount of work on geology and analysing and publishing findings from the Beagle expedition. This was repeatedly delayed by illness.\nDarwin had developed his ideas about sexual selection for this reason since at least the 1850s, and had originally intended to include a long section on the theory in his large, unpublished book on species. When it came to writing Origin (his \" abstract \" of the larger book), though, he did not feel he had sufficient space to engage in sexual selection to any strong degree, and included only three paragraphs devoted to the subject. Darwin considered sexual selection to be as much of a theoretical contribution of his as was his natural selection, and a substantial amount of Descent is devoted exclusively to this topic.\nMany of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin's theory of evolution with  Mendel 's theories of inheritance and genetics. Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky , called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that \" Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs. Nevertheless, some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today:  Louis Pasteur , for example, opposed the theory of  spontaneous generation  with  biogenesis , an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on  chemical evolution  and  abiogenesis . Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.\nCharles Darwin 's publication of the  On the Origin of Species  in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx , an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen . Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.  Thomas Huxley  would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of  natural selection  as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Henry Fairfield Osborn  preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism , the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and  orthogenesis , an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.\nWhere  Charles Darwin 's theories suggested a mechanism for improvement of species over generations, Mendel's observations provided explanation for how a new species itself could emerge. Though Darwin and Mendel never collaborated, they were aware of each other's work (Darwin read a paper by  Wilhelm Olbers Focke  which extensively referenced Mendel).  Bill Bryson  wrote that \"without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life sciences in the twentieth century. Darwin saw that all living things are connected, that ultimately they trace their ancestry to a single, common source; Mendel's work provided the mechanism to explain how that could happen\".  Biologist  J. B. S. Haldane  and others brought together the principles of  Mendelian inheritance  with  Darwinian  principles of evolution to form the field of genetics known as  Modern evolutionary synthesis .\nPrecise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of  pangenesis . In 1865,  Gregor Mendel  reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the  independent assortment  and segregation of elements (later known as  gene s). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.  August Weismann  made the important distinction between  germ cell s that give rise to  gamete s (such as  sperm  and  egg cell s) and the  somatic cell s of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only.  Hugo de Vries  connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the  cell nucleus  and when expressed they could move into the  cytoplasm  to change the  cell s structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as  Ronald Fisher ,  Sewall Wright  and  J. B. S. Haldane  set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and  Mendelian inheritance  was thus reconciled.\nIn many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's  Descent of Man , often in strong disagreement. Wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles, but Wallace and  August Weismann  were nearly alone among prominent biologists in believing that natural selection was the major driving force behind it. In 1889, Wallace published the book  Darwinism  as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection. Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.\nDarwin's ideas developed rapidly after returning from  the Voyage of the Beagle  in 1836. By December 1838, he had developed the basic principles of his theory. At that time, similar ideas brought others disgrace and association with the revolutionary mob. He was conscious of the need to answer all likely objections before publishing.  While he continued with research, he had an immense amount of work in hand analyzing and publishing findings from the Beagle expedition, and was repeatedly delayed by illness.\nSome key developments in biology were the discovery of  genetics ;  Darwin's  theory of  evolution  through  natural selection ; the  germ theory of disease  and the application of the techniques of  chemistry  and  physics  at the level of the  cell  or  organic molecule .\nScientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to  laws of nature , but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \"law of development\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented  natural selection  as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as  inheritance of acquired characters  were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the  empiricism  of  John Stuart Mill 's  A System of Logic , while opponents held to the idealist school of  William Whewell 's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying  biogeography  and ecology, including  Joseph Dalton Hooker  in 1860, and  Asa Gray  in 1862.  Henry Walter Bates  presented research in 1861 that explained  insect mimicry  using natural selection.  Alfred Russel Wallace  discussed evidence from his  Malay archipelago  research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the  Wallace line .\nOne proponent of Malthusianism was the novelist  Harriet Martineau  whose circle of acquaintances included  Charles Darwin , and the ideas of Malthus were a significant influence on the  inception of Darwin's theory of evolution . Darwin was impressed by the idea that population growth would eventually lead to more organisms than could possibly survive in any given environment, leading him to theorise that organisms with a relative advantage in the struggle for survival and reproduction would be able to pass their characteristics on to further generations. Proponents of Malthusianism were in turn influenced by Darwin's ideas, both schools coming to heavily influence the field of  eugenics .  Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr.  advocated \"humane birth selection through humane birth control\" in order to avoid a Malthusian catastrophe by eliminating the \"unfit.\"\nDarwinism is a  theory  of  biological   evolution  developed by the English  naturalist   Charles Darwin  (1809-1882) and others, stating that all  species  of  organism s arise and develop through the  natural selection  of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and  reproduce . Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of  transmutation of species  or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published  On the Origin of Species  in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories, but subsequently referred to specific concepts of natural selection, of the  Weismann barrier  or in  genetics  of the  central dogma of molecular biology . Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution,  creationists  have appropriated it to refer to the  origin of life , and it has even been applied to concepts of  cosmic evolution , both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work\u2014in place of other theories, including  divine design  and  extraterrestrial origins .\nThe von Baer's law (or Law of Development, or von Baer's law of embryology) is a concept in biology introduced by  Karl Ernst von Baer  to explain the details of  embryo development . von Baer formulated the statements in the book \u00dcber Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere (\"On the Developmental History of Animals\"), published in 1828, while working at the  University of K\u00f6nigsberg . He specifically aimed at rebutting the  recapitulation theory  introduced by  Johann Friedrich Meckel  in 1808. According to Meckel's theory, embryos pass through successive stages that represent the adult forms of less complex organisms in the course of development, and that ultimately reflects scala naturae (the  great chain of being ). von Baer believed that such linear development is impossible. He posited that instead of linear progression, embryos started from one, or a few, basic forms that are similar for different animals, and then developed in a branching pattern into increasingly different looking organisms. Defending his ideas, he was also opposed to the theory of  common ancestry and descent with modification  as proposed by  Charles Darwin  in 1859, and particularly the revised recapitulation theory (\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\") of  Ernst Haeckel , a supporter of Darwin's theory in Germany.\nModern evolutionary theory  continues to develop. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching  common descent , has become the unifying theory of the  life science s. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the  geologic record , biogeography, parallels in  embryo nic development,  biological homologies ,  vestigiality ,  cladistics ,  phylogenetics  and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as  medicine  and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political  controversy  has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.\nFrom the early 19th century through most of the 20th century,  embryology  faced a mystery. Animals were seen to develop into adults of widely differing  body plan , often through similar stages, from the egg, but zoologists knew almost nothing about how   embryonic development  was controlled at the  molecular level , and therefore equally little about how  developmental processes  had evolved.  Charles Darwin  argued that a shared embryonic structure implied a common ancestor. As an example of this, Darwin cited in his 1859 book  On the Origin of Species  the  shrimp -like  larva  of the  barnacle , whose  sessile  adults looked nothing like other  arthropods ;  Linnaeus  and  Cuvier  had classified them as  mollusc s. Darwin also noted  Alexander Kowalevsky 's finding that the  tunicate , too, was not a mollusc, but in its larval stage had a  notochord  and pharyngeal slits which developed from the same germ layers as the equivalent structures in  vertebrate s, and should therefore be grouped with them as  chordates . 19th century zoology thus converted  embryology  into an evolutionary science, connecting  phylogeny  with  homologies  between the germ layers of embryos. Zoologists including  Fritz M\u00fcller  proposed the use of embryology to discover  phylogenetic relationships  between taxa. M\u00fcller demonstrated that  crustaceans  shared the  Nauplius  larva, identifying several parasitic species that had not been recognised as crustaceans. M\u00fcller also recognised that  natural selection  must act on larvae, just as it does on adults, giving the lie to recapitulation, which would require larval forms to be shielded from natural selection. Two of Haeckel's other ideas about the evolution of development have fared better than recapitulation: he argued in the 1870s that changes in the timing ( heterochrony ) and changes in the positioning within the body (heterotopy) of aspects of embryonic development would drive evolution by changing the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's. It took a century before these ideas were shown to be correct. In 1917,  D'Arcy Thompson  wrote  a book on the shapes of animals , showing with simple  mathematics  how small changes to  parameter s, such as the angles of a  gastropod 's spiral shell, can radically alter  an animal's form , though he preferred mechanical to evolutionary explanation.But for the next century, without molecular evidence, progress stalled.\nSee the  development of Darwin's theory  for the ensuing developments, in the context of his life, work and outside influences at the time.\nMcCosh's most original work concerned the attempt to reconcile  evolution  and Christianity. In 1874,  Charles Hodge , the theologian and intellectual leader at the Presbyterian Seminary in Princeton,  published What is Darwinism?, claiming that  Darwinism , was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Hodge's views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. Hodge simply refused to accept that natural laws alone could create complex organisms that fit into their niches so perfectly and that evolution could explain origins. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile at the college across town (a totally separate institution) President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However in 1868, McCosh became president at the college. McCosh realized that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus demonstrated that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. McCosh thus argued that evolution, far from being inconsistent with belief in  divine design , glorifies the divine designer (see for example his Christianity and Positivism). This aspect of his work found popularity among most Presbyterians clergy, who found his arguments useful in their attempts to cope with scientific philosophy.  The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge's position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college ( Princeton University ) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.\nWhen  Charles Darwin  proposed his theory of  evolution  in 1859, one of its major problems was the lack of an underlying mechanism for heredity. Darwin believed in a mix of blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired  traits  ( pangenesis ). Blending inheritance would lead to uniformity across populations in only a few generations and then would remove variation from a population on which natural selection could act. This led to Darwin adopting some Lamarckian ideas in later editions of  On the Origin of Species  and his later biological works. Darwin's primary approach to heredity was to outline how it appeared to work (noticing that traits that were not expressed explicitly in the parent at the time of reproduction could be inherited, that certain traits could be  sex-linked , etc.) rather than suggesting mechanisms.\nIn the early 20th century the  modern evolutionary synthesis  integrated  classical genetics  with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of  population genetics . The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of  biology . Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as  orthogenesis ,  evolutionism , and other beliefs about innate \"progress\" within the  largest-scale trends in evolution , became  obsolete scientific theories . Scientists continue to study various aspects of  evolutionary biology  by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing  mathematical models of theoretical biology  and biological theories, using  observational data , and performing  experiment s in both the  field  and the laboratory.\nMendel's work was published in a relatively obscure  scientific journal , and it was not given any attention in the scientific community. Instead, discussions about modes of heredity were galvanized by  Darwin 's theory of  evolution  by natural selection, in which mechanisms of non- Lamarckian  heredity seemed to be required. Darwin's own theory of heredity,  pangenesis , did not meet with any large degree of acceptance. A more mathematical version of pangenesis, one which dropped much of Darwin's Lamarckian holdovers, was developed as the \"biometrical\" school of heredity by Darwin's cousin,  Francis Galton . Under Galton and his successor  Karl Pearson , the biometrical school attempted to build statistical models for heredity and evolution, with some limited but real success, though the exact methods of heredity were unknown and largely unquestioned.\nThe idea of de-evolution is based at least partly on the presumption that \"evolution\" requires some sort of  purposeful direction  towards \" increasing complexity \". Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in  vestigiality  or in loss of genes. Earlier views that species are subject to \"cultural decay\", \"drives to perfection\", or \"devolution\" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory.  Early scientific theories of  transmutation of species  such as  Lamarckism  and  orthogenesis  perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that  adaptation  through  natural selection  comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less \"successful\"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of  genetics  and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by  Gregor Mendel .  Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the  modern evolutionary synthesis  or neo-Darwinism. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular  allele s. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new  mutation s. Selection also might arise from more complex  epigenetic  or other  chromosomal  changes, but the fundamental requirement is that any adaptive effect must be  heritable .\nLike mainstream  evolutionary psychology , EDP is rooted in  Charles Darwin's  theory of natural selection. Darwin himself emphasized development, using the process of embryology as evidence to support his theory. From The Descent of Man:\nGenetics and the Origin of Species provided the outline for a synthesis of genetics with evolution, and was enthusiastically received by both geneticists and naturalists. Dobzhansky laid out an advanced account of the evolutionary process in genetic terms, and he backed up his work with experimental evidence supporting the theoretical arguments. This led to the stimulation of the field of evolutionary genetics, and contributions to the theory soon began to follow. This had a powerful impact on naturalists and experimental biologists, who quickly embraced this new understanding of the evolutionary process as one of genetic change in populations. It was not long before the synthesis was broadened to include paleontology,  systematics  and  botany  in a series of notable books:  Systematics and the Origin of Species  (1942) by  Ernst Mayr ;  Tempo and Mode in Evolution  (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and  Variation and Evolution in Plants  (1950) by  G. Ledyard Stebbins . The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by  Julian Huxley  in his book,  Evolution: The Modern Synthesis . In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete.  Developmental biologists  did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that  molecular biology  bridged the gap. Also, for decades there was disagreement over whether the unit of selection was the gene or the individual as a whole.\nWhen Darwin was developing his theory, he investigated  selective breeding  and was impressed by  Sebright 's observation that \"A severe winter, or a scarcity of food, by destroying the weak and the unhealthy, has all the good effects of the most skilful selection\" so that \"the weak and the unhealthy do not live to propagate their infirmities.\" Darwin was influenced by Charles Lyell's ideas of environmental change causing  ecological shifts , leading to what  Augustin de Candolle  had called a war between competing plant species, competition well described by the botanist  William Herbert . Darwin was struck by  Thomas Robert Malthus ' phrase \"struggle for existence\" used of warring human tribes.\nNatural selection relies crucially on the idea of heredity, but developed before the basic concepts of  genetics . Although the  Moravia n monk  Gregor Mendel , the father of modern genetics, was a contemporary of Darwin's, his work lay in obscurity, only being rediscovered in 1900. Only after the mid-20th century integration of evolution with  Mendel's laws  of inheritance, the so-called  modern evolutionary synthesis , did scientists generally come to accept natural selection. The synthesis grew from advances in different fields. Ronald Fisher developed the required mathematical language and wrote  The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection  (1930).  J. B. S. Haldane  introduced the concept of the \"cost\" of natural selection. Sewall Wright  elucidated the nature of selection and adaptation. Theodosius Dobzhansky  established the idea that mutation, by creating genetic diversity, supplied the raw material for natural selection, in his book  Genetics and the Origin of Species  (1937).  Ernst Mayr  recognised the key importance of  reproductive isolation  for speciation in his  Systematics and the Origin of Species  (1942). W. D. Hamilton  conceived of  kin selection  in 1964.This synthesis cemented natural selection as the foundation of evolutionary theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about at the end of the 20th century by  molecular genetics , creating the field of  evolutionary developmental biology  (evo-devo), which seeks to explain evolution at a molecular level.\nErasmus Darwin's thoughts on evolution. Charles was not the first in his family to consider the concept of evolution. His grandfather Erasmus Darwin (1731 - 1802) was a successful country doctor who published widely in many scientific fields.hus, by the time Charles Darwin became interested in natural history, many of the concepts crucial for his thinking had been developed. Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution by natural selection. Charles Robert Darwin (1809 - 1882) was one of six children born to Robert & Susannah Darwin.\nIn the early 19th century Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution. In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859).Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor.n 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor.\nThe concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, nothing was known of modern genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical and molecular genetics is termed the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nDarwin began formulating his theory of natural selection in the late 1830s but he went on working quietly on it for twenty years. He wanted to amass a wealth of evidence before publicly presenting his idea. During those years he corresponded briefly with Wallace (right), who was exploring the wildlife of South America and Asia. Wallace supplied Darwin with birds for his studies and decided to seek Darwin's help in publishing his own ideas on evolution. He sent Darwin his theory in 1858, which, to Darwin's shock, nearly replicated Darwin's own. Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker arranged for both Darwin's and Wallace's theories to be presented to a meeting of the Linnaean Society in 1858.
