{"input_text": "A baserunner may slide into a base in a number of different ways and for a number of perceived reasons, including to avoid a  tag out , to avoid overrunning the base, and to interfere or avoid contact with the defensive player protecting the base. Adult amateur players should determine whether they will benefit by sliding in a particular game situation, and whether an increased risk of injury will make a slide worthwhile.\nKeeping dancers free of injury is a crucial aspect and will help a lifetime of healthy  physical activity  and can prevent injuries in the future. By being taught a few simple techniques by parents, teachers, and medical professionals can avert injuries from occurring. Following are a few advice's on preventing injuries. Wearing properly fitting clothing and shoes, drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, don\u2019t dance through pain, rest and then start back up again and listen to your teachers for correct technique. For social dance the use of a  sprung floor  is highly recommended. Because a dance injury can ruin a career professional dancers are increasingly refusing to dance on anything else. In  ballet  good  plie ing (bending the knees) on landing helps protect against  knee  injuries and  shin splint s. Many types of dance, especially  folk dances , have hops in the steps where the impact of landing can be reduced by slightly bending the knee.  Warming up  and  cooling down  exercises are recommended before and after exercises to avoid strain, muscle pains, and possible injury. Conditioning is a good way to prevent dance injuries.\nFootball is a full-contact sport, and injuries are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players. To try to prevent injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a  football helmet  and a set of  shoulder pads , but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh pads and guards, knee pads, chest protectors, and  mouthguard s. Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are  strains ,  sprain s,  bruise s, fractures,  dislocations , and  concussions . Repeated concussions can increase a person's risk in later life for  chronic traumatic encephalopathy  and mental health issues such as  dementia ,  Parkinson's disease , and  depression . Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as  skull fracture s. Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits;  USA Football 's \"Heads Up Football\" program is aiming to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact. However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective.\nHandled the ball is one of the ten methods of  dismissing  a  batsman  in the sport of  cricket . It dictates that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the  ball  with a hand that is not holding their  bat . An exception is given if the batsman handles the ball to avoid injury. It is governed by Law 33 of the  laws of cricket , and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: in the history of cricket, there have been 60 instances in  first-class matches  and 5 occasions in  List A  games. In most cases this occurs when a batsman thinks that the ball is going to hit their  wicket , and knocks it away from the stumps with their hand.\nAfter racing, Bailey started his own company called DBX Sport Management which helps amateur athletes find a way to promote themselves.  He also started a sport injury clinic in Oakville, Ontario.\nEach of the studies discussed the effects of falling, and How Should a Climber Fall? also taught the best way to fall especially to avoid head and neck injuries. The Yosemite study points out that injury usually is not related to the distance of the fall nor the frequency of falls: it depends more on the rock surface the climber hits. In reviewing these studies of climbing injuries, and focusing mainly on lead climbing injuries, it is apparent that the chance of major injury is relatively slim, that potential injuries to the head and neck are more slim, and that minor injuries, though more common, seem to be infrequent as well.\nThe risk of injuring the ACL is very high for an athlete, as most professionals say it is worrying how common the injury is becoming. As there is no real way to stop an ACL injury from occurring, there can be ways to lower the risk. Once an athlete does an ACL injury it is extremely difficult to be able to come back to football, it even creates a higher risk of a second ACL injury after having the first reconstructed. This is why it is vitally important for an AFL player to build strong muscles and bones to benefit them in their career. Small doses of training can help prevent ACL injuries, as athletes will not over train leaving their body fatigued and sore. The small doses of training only have to include, strength, balance, plyo- metric or agility to gain some prevention from the injury. It is also important to talk to the coach or training staff to inform them of what you can and cannot do. Some things in life are preventable, but injuries such as ACL injuries are just too hard to prevent.\nA safeword, as used in sports, is a  code word  used by a player to avoid impending  injury .\nDancing en pointe stresses the feet in various ways and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not plan ahead or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding  sickling . Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.\nBarefoot running  has been promoted as a means of reducing running related injuries, but this remains controversial and a majority of professionals advocate the wearing of appropriate shoes as the best method for avoiding injury. However, a study in 2013 concluded that wearing neutral shoes is not associated with increased injuries.\nIn the recent years schools have begun restricting many favorite past time games such as: red rover, tag, tag-football, not-it, Dodge Ball and many others. Many schools have made the choice to restrict contact games and equipment used on playgrounds that may possibly cause injury to students. In some schools across the country have decided to replace hard material balls; such as footballs, soccer balls, and basketballs with a softer material like sponge to prevent injuries caused by the impact of the moving object. Along with restricting games and equipment other physical activities such as cart wheels are no longer allowed without supervision of a physical education instructor. In recent years states have adopted new state regulations of playground safety. Most states that have adopted these regulations require that the schools comply with the  U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission  which guidelines state what type of equipment is safe for each age group (see http://www.cpsc.gov/PageFiles/16103/325.pdf) for full guidelines. Due to the schools needing to comply with these regulations certain equipment such as the  Merry-Go-Round  have been removed from the playgrounds, although equipment such as the  Merry-Go-Round  is acceptable for older age groups they are still being removed due to the various age groups using the playground which then makes the Merry Go Rounds and other equipment not acceptable for the age use. Although the restrictions and guidelines for playground use are fairly new, the issue for playground safety and schools liability has always been a concern for many schools all over the country for years. School staff and other faculty are protected and some only to an extent by the  Tort  Law (see http://www.educator-resources.com/pdf/Teacher%20Tort%20Liability.pdf) but due to recent lawsuits schools have chosen to take more precautions to avoid lawsuits concerning playground safety. Like the, NORMAN v. TURKEY RUN COMMUNITY SCH. CORP., a lawsuit brought against the school for what the parents felt was not proper supervision on the playground at time of the accident but the courts were in favor of the school. Also ROLLINS v. CONCORDIA PARISH SCHOOL BOARD, another case involving student supervision during recess but in this case the court found that the supervision was inadequate. Court cases these have caused the schools to take extra precautionary measures and cover anything that could possibly cause injury to the students to avoid liability issues. So now many schools will have updated their guidelines in hopes to prevent any injuries, here is an example of what this school\u2019s guidelines are like (http://lincoln.bsd.k12.ca.us/modules/cms/pages.phtml?pageid=78288). Parents and professionals who studied human behavior have another concern with schools restricting recess games and equipment on playgrounds. Many parents are concerned that school is going overboard in trying to prevent injuries and that the schools are not allowing children to play and enjoy many favorite pastimes.  Although the lawsuits that many schools are trying to avoid are brought against them by the parents of the children attending their schools there is another legal avenue that the schools are faced with and that is a petition by the parents to overturn the decisions of restricting recess games. The other concern by professionals who study  human behaviors  are concerned that restricting certain games will not allow the children to learn certain boundaries, coordination skills, and other human behaviors that we as humans learn socially, then there is the concern of  obesity  and how restricting running will have an effect on children if they\u2019re not allowed these activities.\nPrevention  helps reduce potential sport injuries and provides several benefits. Some benefits include a  health ier athlete, longer duration of participation in the sport, potential for better performance, and reduced medical costs. Explaining the benefits to participate in sports  injury prevention program s to coaches, team trainers, sports teams, and individual athletes will give them a glimpse at the likelihood for success by having the athletes feeling they are healthy, strong, comfortable, and capable to compete.\nForm is a specific way of performing a movement, often a  strength training  exercise, to avoid injury, prevent  cheating  and increase strength.\nTwo thirds of injuries occur to the upper body and one third to the lower body. This contrasts with alpine skiing where two thirds of injuries are to the lower body. The most common types of injuries are sprains, which account for around 40% of injuries. The most common point of injury is the wrists \u2013 40% of all snowboard injuries are to the wrists and 24% of all snowboard injuries are wrist fractures. There are around 100,000 wrist fractures worldwide among snowboarders each year. For this reason the use of wrist guards, either separate or built into gloves, is very strongly recommended. They are often compulsory in beginner's classes and their use reduces the likelihood of wrist injury by half. In addition it is important for snow boarders to learn how to fall without stopping the fall with their hand by trying to \"push\" the slope away, as landing a wrist which is bent at a 90 degree angle increase the chance of it breaking. Rather, landing with the arms stretched out (like a wing) and slapping the slope with the entire arm is an effective way to break a fall. This is the method used by practitioners of judo and other martial arts to break a fall when they are thrown against the floor by a training partner.\nSports injuries are injuries that occur in athletic activities or  exercising . In the United States there are about 30 million teenagers and children alone that participate in some form of organized sport. About 3 million avid sports competitors 14 years of age and under experience sports injuries annually, which causes some loss of time of participation in the sport. The leading cause of death involving sports-related injuries, although rare, is  brain injuries . When injured the two main systems affected are the  nervous  and  vascular systems . The origins in the body where  numbness  and  tingling  occurs upon sports injuries are usually the first signs of the body telling you that the body was impacted. Thus, when an athlete complains of numbness and especially tingling, the key to a diagnosis is to obtain a detailed history of the athlete\u2019s acquired symptom perception, determine the effect the injury had on the body and its processes, and then establish the prime treatment method. In the process to determine what exactly happened in the body and the standing effects most medical professionals choose a method of technological medical devices to acquire a credible solution to the site of injury. Prevention helps reduce potential sport injuries. It is important to establish participation in  warm-ups , stretching, and  exercises  that focus on main muscle groups commonly used in the sport of interest. Also, creating an injury prevention program as a team, which includes education on  rehydration ,  nutrition , monitoring team members \u201cat risk\u201d, monitoring behavior, skills, and techniques. Season analysis reviews and preseason screenings are also beneficial reviews for preventing player sport injuries. One technique used in the process of preseason screening is the functional movement screen. The functional movement screen can assess movement patterns in athletes in order to find the at risk players. Following various researches about sport injuries shows that levels of  anxiety ,  stress , and  depression  are elevated. A study in 2010 found that athletes with severe sports injuries would display higher levels of post-traumatic distress and the higher the levels of post-traumatic distress are linked with avoidant  coping skills .\nThe trauma of being in high school is enough pressure on a student to cause them significant stress.  When considering the substantial amounts of drama teenagers are surrounded by, as well as school itself, one might believe this is the hardest time in life.  Adding injury to the stress of everyday life can be very hard for a young person.  The students\u2019 parents, coaches, and other care-givers do their best to keep the students safe and enable them to have the best experience high school can offer.  To succeed in this endeavor, the child\u2019s safety is a priority. Those student athletes are a specific worry, as they are put at risk more often.  One such risk of concern is the high rate of  concussions  among teens compared to other age groups.   There should be specific consideration as to the prevention of concussions, as well as knowledge of how to manage such head injuries.  A concussion is known to many as the possible result of a person being hit on the head.  What takes place for a concussion to occur involves the human anatomy.  Teens Health describes the anatomy head and states \u201cthe brain is made of soft tissue and is cushioned by spinal fluid. It is encased in the hard, protective skull\u201d (Concussions 3).  The brain floating inside the spinal fluid is able to move inside the skull.  When it is forced in one direction or the other it can actually come into contact with the skull.  Teen health continues to explain \u201cthis can lead to bruising of the brain, tearing of blood vessels, and injury to the nerves\u201d (Concussions paragraph 3).  Many teens make time to be active in  extracurricular activities  as well as throughout the community. These activities include a variety of sports which can be risky to the student\u2019s safety.  The dangers of playing sports do not necessarily outweigh the benefits of such activities, but they are definitely something to consider. Some sports at specific risk include basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football.  Football accounts for 45.8% of total reported head injuries for high schools in Missouri (MSHSAA 10).  The Sports Concussion Institute states a concussion \u201ccan be caused either by a direct blow to the head, or an indirect blow to the body, causing neurological impairments that may resolve spontaneously\u201d (Concussion Facts 1).  The blow to the body causes a series of reactions in the brain which cause a variety of symptoms associated with disruption of the brain.  Prevention efforts in high school athletics can start with high quality practice time for the sports in question.  For example, a football player who learns the proper way to tackle, spends time in the weight room, and maintains overall good health choices is more likely to avoid situations which put them in harm\u2019s way.  Aside from proper learning of the game at hand, the best coaches and parents can to for the students is to educate themselves, as well as the athletes, on knowing the signs of a concussion, as well as being prepared to handle one.  The CDC gives a list of possible signs to look for in the players after a jolt to the head or body.  These include a dazed appearance, confusion, forgetfulness, lack of confidence in actions, clumsy, slower than normal, loss of consciousness, changes in mood, behavior, or personality, and inability to remember events prior to, or after the hit (Concussion Tool Kit 5). The student may report any of these signs as well as sensitivity to light or sound, double vision, a headache, or any abnormal feelings.If a student displays any of the symptoms described, they should be prevented from participating the rest of the day, and be seen by a health professional.  With medical attention, proper care may be given to the student.  Their parents should also be informed of the incident so they can also watch for signs of abnormality.  Signs and symptoms can last from hours after the injury to months afterward.  Recognizing the problem is the first step toward the solution.  Coaches should educate themselves about concussions and also provide information for athletes, parents, and other faculty and staff members.The coaches should inquire about their players\u2019 medical history, specifically if they have ever had a concussion before.  The Sports Concussion Institute explains after getting one concussion \u201cthey are 1-2 times more likely to receive a second one. If they've had two concussions, then a third is 2-4 times more likely, and if they've had three concussions, then they are 3-9 times more likely to receive their fourth concussion\u201d (Concussion Facts paragraph 7).  Once having this information coaches should properly monitor those players who have a history of head injury.  Parents and coaches need to express the importance of safety while at play.  This also means the guidelines for safety equipment, such as helmets, must be followed.  The importance of good sportsmanship should also be stressed to the teams.  Those students who have been diagnosed with a concussion are likely to be frustrated, impatient, and angry about the situation.  A concussed player could be sitting on the bench for weeks to months depending on when medical professionals clear them to play.  It is imperative that they follow the instructions given by those professionals in order to properly recover.  In some cases the stress of deep thought can also be difficult, causing greater frustration.  The CDC explains, \u201cAfter a concussion, physical and cognitive activities\u2014such as concentrating and learning\u2014should be carefully managed and monitored by a health care professional\u201d (Concussion Tool Kit 7).Ultimately the brain is a vital organ which is also fragile when in an injured state.  Once it has been damaged, without proper care, consequences can be severe. The risk for high school aged students is greater than that of older people, so it is important for parents and coaches to take the necessary precautions.  Education is the first act of prevention for students as well as coaches, parents, and other faculty and staff.  The importance of safety, sportsmanship, and use of equipment should be stressed to high school athletes.   With the proper skills in recognition of signs of a head injury, as well as knowledge on the actions to take once a concussion has occurred, the safety of these players can be increased and they can continue to play the games they love.\nThe greatest potential for injury while  rock climbing  occurs when a lead climber falls. Several published studies have researched climbing injuries, especially lead climbing injuries and how to avoid them. Chances of neck and head injuries are very low and they can be avoided by falling correctly.\nEducation and knowledge on stretches and exercises is important. Exercises should lack pain and increase gradually with intensity. The patient is given strict guidelines on how to perform exercises at home to avoid more injury. Exercises can include leg raises, squats, and wall stretches to increase quadriceps and hamstring strength. This helps to avoid pain, stress, and tight muscles that lead to further injury that oppose healing. Knee  orthotics  such as patella straps and knee sleeves help decrease force traction and prevent painful  tibia  contact by restricting unnecessary movement, providing support, and also adding compression to the area of pain.\nThe simplest way to prevent muscle cramps is to avoid or limit the exercises that strain your muscles and cause cramps.
