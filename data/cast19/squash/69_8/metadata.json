{"input_text": "When foods with a high  glycemic index  are consumed, the carbohydrates in the food are more easily digested than low glycemic index foods. Hence, more glucose is available for absorption. It should not be misunderstood that glucose is absorbed more rapidly because, once formed, glucose is absorbed at the same rate. It is only available in higher amounts due to the ease of digestion of high glycemic index foods. In individuals with normal  carbohydrate metabolism ,  insulin  levels rise concordantly to drive glucose into the body's tissues and maintain blood glucose levels in the normal range. Insulin stimulates the uptake of  valine ,  leucine , and  isoleucine  into  skeletal muscle , but not uptake of  tryptophan . This lowers the ratio of these  branched-chain amino acids  in the bloodstream relative to tryptophan (an  aromatic amino acid ), making tryptophan preferentially available to the  large neutral amino acid transporter  at the blood\u2013brain barrier. Uptake of tryptophan by the brain thus increases. In the brain, tryptophan is converted to  serotonin , which is then converted to  melatonin . Increased brain serotonin and melatonin levels result in sleepiness.\nAn adult is expected to sleep 7\u20139 hours per night to be properly rested, while adolescents from the age of 10-17 need 8.5-9.5 hours of sleep, with the hours needed decreasing with increased age. Failing to meet these sleep needs has been linked with  depression , obesity,  diabetes , and  cardiovascular disease .  An important factor in sleep is  melatonin , a hormone produced in the  pineal gland  that is associated with sleep facilitation. During the daytime, blood melatonin levels are barely detectable, but at night, melatonin levels are high. This phenomenon is due to light's effect on melatonin production. If there is sufficient light, then melatonin production is halted. It is possible for artificial light to be bright enough to have this effect.\nMelatonin has been reported in foods including cherries to about 0.17\u201313.46 ng/g, bananas and grapes, rice and cereals, herbs, plums, olive oil,  wine  and beer. When birds ingest melatonin-rich plant feed, such as rice, the melatonin binds to melatonin receptors in their brains. When humans consume foods rich in melatonin such as banana, pineapple and orange, the blood levels of melatonin increase significantly.\nEnforcing a 24-hour sleep\u2013wake schedule using alarm clocks or family interventions is often tried but usually unsuccessful.  Bright light exposure on awakening to counteract the tendency for circadian rhythms to delay, similar to the treatment for  delayed sleep phase disorder , and  seasonal affective disorder  (SAD) has been found to be effective in some cases, as has melatonin administration in the subjective late afternoon or evening.   Light therapy  involves at least 20 minutes of exposure to 3000 to 10000 lux light intensity. Going outside on a bright sunny day can accomplish the same benefit as special light fixtures ( light box es).  Bright light therapy combined with the use of melatonin as a  chronobiotic  and avoidance of light before bedtime may be the most effective treatment.  Melatonin administration shifts circadian rhythms according to a  phase response curve  (PRC) that is essentially the inverse of the light PRC.   When taken in the late afternoon or evening, it resets the clock earlier; when taken in the morning, it shifts the clock later.   Therefore, successful entrainment depends on the appropriate timing of melatonin administration. The accuracy needed for successfully timing the administration of melatonin requires a period of trial and error, as does the dosage. In addition to natural fluctuations within the circadian rhythm, seasonal changes including temperature, hours of daylight, light intensity and diet are likely to affect the efficacy of melatonin and light therapies since these exogenous  zeitgeber s would compete for hormonal homoeostasis. Further to this there are unforeseen disruptions to contend with even when a stabilised cycle is achieved; such as travel, exercise, stress, alcohol or even the use of light emitting technology close to a subjective evening/night.\nEating foods containing melatonin is a natural way to help increase the amount of the hormone in your body. Melatonin also is said to help with jet lag and slowing the aging process.\nAnd soon, the morning sun comes up for a new day. Insomnia is a terrifying health problem. Some even feel scared when night time approaches. Without good sleep, there's no energy to work in day time.And long term deprivation of good sleep causes all sorts of sicknesses including Alzheimer's disease.t secretes melatonin hormone that put us to sleep. Due to various factors such as stress and unhealthy diet, the melatonin level becomes lower. And this causes insomnia and poor immune system. However, researches showed that a natural substance called polysaccharides can naturally strengthen pineal gland function.\nMelatonin production is dependent on adequate levels of serotonin. Research studies indicate that a darker nighttime environment promotes the synthesis of greater amounts of melatonin, as do longer winter nights. Taking a supplement that boosts serotonin will also lead to increased melatonin levels.The complex synthesis of these two essential compounds is delicately regulated with even slight variations in their production or release producing a significant impact on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy, mood, and sleep.his is a natural chemical precursor of serotonin and melatonin. 5-HTP is a dietary supplement made from the extract of a medicinal shrub, Griffonia simplicifolia, a perennial plant native to Mexico and Central America.\nMelatonin levels rise naturally during the night, helping promote sleep, and are suppressed during the day, allowing us to be alert and wakeful. Calcium, like magnesium and potassium, is also a natural relaxant in the body. Dairy products are rich in calcium, and can be a good choice for a sleep-friendly evening snack.\nIt may be possible to increase melatonin levels by adding certain foods to the diet that contain this hormone. One study explains that all plant foods include Melatonin at differing levels. Some plant foods that include more Melatonin than others are rice, tomatoes, walnuts, barley and olives.\nNatural melatonin in foods.
