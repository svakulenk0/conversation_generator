{"input_text": "In  Portuguese  and  Brazilian cuisine , collard greens (or couve) are common accompaniments of fish and meat dishes. They are a standard side dish for  feijoada , a popular  pork and beans -style stew.\nThe practice of cooking a meat (pork) stew with vegetables that gave origin to the feijoada from the  Minho Province  in Northern Portugal is a millenary Mediterranean tradition that can be traced back to the period when the Romans colonized Iberia. Roman soldiers would bring this habit to every Latin settlement, i.e., all of the provinces of Romania, the Vulgar Latin speaking area of Europe (not to be confused with the modern country solely), and this heritage is the source of many national and regional dishes of today's Europe, such as the French  cassoulet , the Milanese  cassoeula  from Lombardy, Italy, the Romanian  fasole cu c\u00e2rna\u021bi , the  fabada asturiana  from Northwestern Spain, near Portugal, and the also Spanish  cocido madrile\u00f1o  and  olla podrida , not to mention non-Romanic regions with similar traditions that might be derived from this millennial Roman soldiers' dish like the Polish tsholem and golonka.\nIn Brazil it is a common ingredient of the bean stew  feijoada .\nIn Brazil  feijoada , arroz carreteiro (cart riders rice), and  farofa  are common; Bahia, a state in Brazil, has its own cuisine which has heavy African influences.\nAfter the departure of Jab\u00e1, the band had several different bass players and recorded a studio album with only punk and hardcore covers called Feijoada Acidente?, a play on the  Guns N' Roses  album  The Spaghetti Incident? .

There were two versions of this album: one covering only Brazilian bands such as Olho Seco, Lobotomia, Garotos Podres, among others; and one covering only non-Brazilian bands such as G.B.H., Black Flag, Anti-Cimex, Minor Threat, among others. At this time, Walter Bart (who used to play in a punk band called \"N\u00e3o Religi\u00e3o\") and \"Pica Pau\" (Portuguese for woodpecker), who stayed in the band until 1999, played bass.\nAs a celebratory dish, Feijoada is traditionally served on Saturday afternoons or Sunday lunch and intended to be a leisurely midday meal. It is meant to be enjoyed throughout the day and not eaten under rushed circumstances. The meal is usually eaten among extended family and paired with an event like watching a  soccer game  or other social event. Because of the dish's heavy ingredients and rich flavors, feijoada is viewed as Brazilian soul food. In the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Feijoada is a common dish on restaurants on Wednesdays, mainly on the commercial area. The dish is served with ingredients separated for clients choose what they want, with more meat, pork, bacon or just the beans.  The variation of vegetarian feijoada is also found. Another variation is a lighter version of Feijoada, made with meat cuts and sausages that contain less fat than the original recipes.  The dish is frequently compared to American Southern  Soul Food  which share many similarities in terms of ingredients and taste.\nModern variants of the dish are based on ancient feijoada recipes from the Brazilian regions of  Rio de Janeiro ,  S\u00e3o Paulo  and  Salvador .

Portuguese influences are strongly evident in  Brazilian cuisine , which features its own versions of Portuguese dishes, such as  feijoada  and  caldeirada  (fish stew). Other Portuguese influences can be tasted in the Chinese territory of  Macau  ( Macanese cuisine ) and in the Indian province of  Goa , where  Goan  dishes, such as  vindalho  (a spicy  curry ), show the pairing of  vinegar  and  garlic .\nIn Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, batidas are traditionally served with the Brazilian national dish,  feijoada .\nUnlike the  Italian  fagiolata, the  Brazilian  and  Portuguese   feijoada ,  Romanian  fasole and the  Spanish   fabada , fasolada does not contain meat.\nPortuguese and Brazilian influence was also added during Portuguese colonization.

Slaves would supposedly craft this hearty dish out of  black beans  and pork leftovers given to them from their households. These leftovers included pig feet, ears, tail, and other portions seen as unfit for the master and his family. However, this theory has recently been contested and considered more of a modern advertising technique for the dish rather than a basis for its origins. Instead, scholars argue that the history of feijoada traces back to Brazil\u2019s cultivation of beans. Because of the crop\u2019s relatively low cost of production and the simplicity of its maintenance, beans became a staple food among European settlers in  Brazil . Although black beans were eaten by both the upper-classes and the poor, the upper-classes particularly enjoyed them with an assortment of meat and vegetables, similar to feijoada, while the poor and enslaved usually ate a mixture of black beans and manioc flour.\nBrazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations. This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences. Examples are  Feijoada , considered the country's national dish; and regional foods such as  vatap\u00e1 ,  moqueca ,  polenta  and  acaraj\u00e9 .\nFeijoada has been described as a  national dish  of  Brazil , especially of  Rio de Janeiro , as other parts of Brazil have other regional dishes.

In some regions of the northeast, like  Bahia  and  Sergipe , vegetables like cabbage, kale, potatoes, carrots, okra, pumpkin, chayote and sometimes banana are frequently added, at the end of the cooking, on top of the meat, so they are cooked by the vapors of the beans and meat stew.This stew is best prepared over a low fire in a thick clay pot. The final dish has the beans and meat pieces barely covered by a dark purplish-brown broth. The taste is strong, moderately salty but not spicy, dominated by the flavors of black bean and meat stew.
