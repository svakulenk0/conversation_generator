Envolve provided developers an API that let them integrate online chat into their websites. After releasing the chat service,  Tamplin  and Lee found that the service was being used to pass application data that wasn't chat messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application data such as game state in realtime across their users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system and the real-time architecture that powered it, founding Firebase as a separate company in April 2012.Firebase raised $1.4 million in  seed funding  in May 2012 from  Flybridge Capital Partners ,  Greylock Partners ,  NEA  and others.
