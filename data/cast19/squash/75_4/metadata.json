{"input_text": "The Narragansett turkey is a  breed  of  Meleagris gallopavo  which descends from a  cross  between the  eastern wild turkey  (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) and the  domestic turkey . According to the  American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , the Narragansett turkey is a \"historic variety, unique to  North America \" and is named for  Narragansett Bay .\nA heritage turkey is one of a variety of strains of  domestic turkey  which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority of turkeys raised for consumption since the mid-20th century. Heritage turkeys can be differentiated from other domestic turkeys in that they are biologically capable of being raised in a manner that more closely matches the natural behavior and life cycle of  wild turkey s. Heritage turkeys have a relatively long lifespan and a much slower growth rate than turkeys bred for  industrial agriculture , and unlike industrially-bred turkeys, can  reproduce  without  artificial insemination .\nThe label is also often used in  agriculture . Africa, Asia, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the  Neolithic Revolution , and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as \"Old World\". Common Old World crops (e.g.,  barley ,  lentil s,  oats ,  pea s,  rye ,  wheat ), and domesticated animals (e.g.,  cattle ,  chicken s,  goat s,  horse s,  pig s,  sheep ) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post- Columbian contact  in the 1490s (see \" Columbian Exchange \"). Conversely, many common  crops  were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as \" New World crops \";  common bean s (phaseolus),  maiz , and  squash  - the \" three sisters \" - as well as the  avocado ,  tomato , and wide varieties of  capsicum  ( bell pepper ,  chili pepper , etc.), and the  turkey  were originally domesticated by  pre-Columbian  peoples in  Mesoamerica , while agriculturalists in the  Andean  region of South America brought forth the  cassava ,  peanut ,  potato ,  quinoa  and domesticated animals like the  alpaca ,  guinea pig  and  llama . Other famous New World crops include the  cashew ,  cocoa ,  rubber ,  sunflower ,  tobacco , and  vanilla , and fruits like the  guava ,  papaya  and  pineapple . There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the  calabash  (bottle-gourd),  cotton , and  yam , and the  dog , are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the  Old  and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by  Paleo-Indians  from Asia during the  last glacial period .\nThe domesticated turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo ) is a large  poultry   bird , one of the two  species  in the  genus   Meleagris  and the same as the  wild turkey . Although turkey domestication was thought to have occurred in central Mesoamerica at least 2,000 years ago, recent research suggests a possible second domestication event in the Southwestern United States between 200 BC - AD 500.  However, all of the commercial domesticated turkey varieties today descend from the domesticated turkey raised in central Mexico that was subsequently imported into Europe by the Spanish in the 16th century.\nRegardless of whether or not the dish was constructed in the pre-Hispanic period as it is today, the ancient Mayans would have had access to all of the basic ingredients used in the modern dish. Corn, tomatoes, and chiles were all staples in the Mesoamerican diet. Pumpkin seeds, likewise, were an important part of the Mayan diet.  Chicken eggs were unknown to pre-Hispanic Mayans, but several other fowl capable of providing eggs were known and eaten.  Turkeys  and  muscovy duck s were both domesticated, and both produce edible eggs. In addition to that, the Mayans ate non-domesticated fowl including the  curassow ,  crested guan ,  horned guan ,  chachalaca , and  ocellated turkey , although it is unclear the extent to which edible eggs could have been obtained from these birds.  Aside from the eggs of fowl,  iguana  eggs were also used in Mayan cooking and could conceivably have been used to make this dish.\nSpaniards had encountered  domesticated turkeys  in  Panama  in 1502. These turkeys were part of a pre-existing land trade route throughout Central and South America carried out by various native peoples. The Spanish then brought the turkey back to Spain where it became a popular new type of meat eaten by the masses.\nTurkeys have been considered by many authorities to be their own family\u2014the Meleagrididae\u2014but a recent genomic analyses of a  retrotransposon marker  groups turkeys in the family  Phasianidae . In 2010, a team of scientists published a draft sequence of the domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) genome.\nThe modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six  subspecies  of  wild turkey :  Meleagris gallopavo , found in the area bounded by the present Mexican states of  Jalisco ,  Guerrero , and  Veracruz  Ancient  Mesoamerica ns domesticated this subspecies, using its meat and eggs as major sources of protein and employing its feathers extensively for decorative purposes. The  Aztec s associated the turkey with their  trickster god   Tezcatlipoca , perhaps because of its perceived humorous behavior.\nThe other theory arises from the fact that turkeys came to England from the Americas via merchant ships from the Middle East where they were  domesticated  successfully. Again the importers lent the name to the bird: because these merchants were called \"Turkey merchants\" as much of the area was part of the  Ottoman Empire . Hence the name \u201cTurkey birds\u201d or, soon thereafter, \u201cturkeys\u201d.\nThe wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is an upland ground bird native to  North America  and is the heaviest member of the diverse  Galliformes . It is the same  species  as the  domestic turkey , which was originally derived from a southern Mexican  subspecies  of wild turkey (not the related  ocellated turkey ). Although native to North America, the turkey probably got its name from the domesticated variety being imported to Britain in ships coming from the  Levant  via Spain. The British at the time therefore associated the wild turkey with the country  Turkey  and the name prevails.\nThe first volume of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication consists in a lengthy and highly detailed exploration of the mechanisms of variation, including the principle of use and disuse, the principle of the correlation of parts, and the role of the environment in causing variation, at work in a number of domestic species.  Darwin starts with dogs and cats, discussing the similarities between wild and domesticated dogs, and musing on how the species changed to accommodate man's wishes.  He attempts to trace a genealogy of contemporary varieties (or \"races\") back to a few early progenitors.  These arguments, as well as many others, use the vast amount of data Darwin gathered about dogs and cats to support his overarching thesis of evolution through natural selection.  He then goes on to make similar points regarding horses and donkeys, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, various types of domesticated fowl, a large number of different cultivated plants, and, most thoroughly, pigeons.\nMesoamerica lacked animals suitable for domestication, most notably domesticated large  ungulate s \u2013 the lack of  draft animals  to assist in transportation is one notable difference between Mesoamerica and the cultures of the South American Andes. Other animals, including the  duck ,  dog s, and  turkey , were  domesticated . Turkey was the first, occurring around 3500 BC. Dogs were the primary source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica, and dog bones are common in midden deposits throughout the region.\nThe wild turkey, throughout its range, plays a significant role in the cultures of many  Native American tribe s all over North America. Outside of the Thanksgiving feast, it is a favorite meal in eastern tribes. Eastern Native American tribes consumed both the eggs and meat, sometimes turning the latter into a type of jerky to preserve it and make it last through cold weather. They provided habitat by burning down portions of forests to create meadows which would attract mating birds, and thus give a clear shot to hunters. The feathers of turkeys also often made their way into the rituals and headgear of many tribes. Many leaders, such as  Catawba  chiefs, traditionally wore turkey feather headdresses. Significant peoples of several tribes, including  Muscogee Creek  and  Wampanoag , wore turkey feather cloaks. The turkey clan is one of the three  Lenape  clans. Movements of wild turkeys inspired the  Caddo  tribe's  turkey dance .The  Navajo people  of Southeastern Arizona, New Mexico and Utah call the turkey  T\u0105zhii and relate the bird to the corn and seeds which The Turkey in Navajo folklore brought from the Third Navajo World.  It is one of the Navajos' sacred birds, with the Navajo people using the feathers and parts in multiple traditional ceremonies.\nThe south Mexican wild turkey is considered the  nominate subspecies , and the only one that is not found in the United States or Canada. In central Mexico, archaeological M. gallopavo bones have been identified at sites dating to 800\u2013100 BC [10], [11]. It is unclear whether these early specimens represent wild or domestic individuals, but domestic turkeys were likely established in central Mexico by the first half of the Classic Period (c. AD 200\u20131000).  Late Preclassic (300 BC\u2013AD 100) turkey remains identified at the archaeological site of El Mirador (Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala) represent the earliest evidence of the export of the Mexican turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) to the ancient Maya world.  The  Mexican  subspecies, M. g. gallopavo, was  domesticated , either in Mexico or by Preclassic peoples in  Mesoamerica , giving rise to the  domestic turkey . The Spaniards brought this tamed subspecies back to Europe with them in the mid-16th century; from Spain it spread to France and later Britain as a farmyard animal, usually becoming the centerpiece of a feast for the well-to-do. By 1620 it was common enough so that Pilgrim settlers of Massachusetts could bring turkeys with them from  England , unaware that it had a larger close relative already occupying the forests of Massachusetts. It is one of the smallest subspecies and is best known in Spanish from its Aztec-derived name, guajolote. This wild turkey subspecies is thought to be critically endangered, as of 2010.\nThe species Meleagris gallopavo is used by humans for their meat. However, they were first domesticated by the indigenous people of Mexico from at least 800 BC onwards.  These domesticates were then either introduced into what is now the Southwest US or independently domesticated a second time by the indigenous people of that region by 200 BC, at first for their feathers, which were used in ceremonies and to make robes and blankets. Turkeys were first used for meat by Native Americans by about AD 1100. Compared to wild turkeys, domestic turkeys are selectively bred to grow larger in size for their meat. Humans normally eat turkeys on special occasions such as at  Thanksgiving  or  Christmas .\nAs a cultural area, Mesoamerica is defined by a mosaic of cultural traits developed and shared by its indigenous cultures. Beginning as early as 7000 BC, the domestication of  cacao ,  maize ,  beans ,  tomato ,  squash  and  chili , as well as the  turkey  and  dog , caused a transition from  paleo-Indian  hunter-gatherer tribal grouping to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent Formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex  mythological and religious tradition , a  vigesimal  numeric system, and a  complex calendric system , a  tradition of ball playing , and a distinct  architectural style , were diffused through the area. Also in this period, villages began to become socially stratified and develop into  chiefdom s with the development of large ceremonial centers, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods, such as  obsidian ,  jade ,  cacao ,  cinnabar ,  Spondylus  shells,  hematite , and ceramics. While Mesoamerican civilization did know of the wheel and basic metallurgy, neither of these technologies became culturally important.\nThe modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six  subspecies  of  wild turkey  (Meleagris gallopavo) found in the present Mexican states of  Jalisco ,  Guerrero  and  Veracruz .  Pre-Aztec tribes in south-central Mexico first domesticated the bird around 800 BC, and Pueblo Indians inhabiting the Colorado Plateau in the United States did likewise around 200 BC. They used the feathers for robes, blankets, and ceremonial purposes.  More than 1,000 years later, they became an important food source.  The first Europeans to encounter the bird misidentified it as a guineafowl, a bird known as a \"turkey fowl\" at that time because it had been introduced into Europe via Turkey.\nThey were first domesticated in Mexico and brought to Europe in the 16th century. A male turkey is called a tom or a gobbler, a female turkey a hen, and a baby turkey a poult or chick. A young male turkey is called a jake and a young female is called a jenny. A group of wild turkeys is called a flock, a group of domesticated turkeys is commonly referred to as a rafter. Turkeys are able to adapt to a wide variety of habitats.

The passage from the Old Word to the New World in the Columbian Exchange was made by animals as well as humans. Both the non-domesticated and the domesticated animals made an impact on the New World. For example some of these impacts were the transformation of the grasslands and revolutionizing of labor.here was an exchange from the New World to the Old World as well. Explorers brought back turkeys, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs to Europe. These animals did not have as much of an impact on the Old World as the animals brought to the New World had.\nThey were first domesticated in Mexico and brought to Europe in the 16th century.

The great majority of domesticated turkeys are bred to have white feathers because their pin feathers are less visible when the carcass is dressed, although brown or bronze-feathered varieties are also raised.\nThe domesticated turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is a large poultry bird, one of the two species in the genus Meleagris and the same as the wild turkey.It was domesticated by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica at least 2,000 years ago, with the evidence pointing to what are today the central regions of Mexico.urkey meat is a popular form of poultry, and turkeys are raised throughout temperate parts of the world, partially because industrialized farming has made it very cheap for the amount of meat it produces. Female domesticated turkeys are referred to as hens and the chicks may be called poults or turkeylings.\nTurkeys are raised extensively because of the excellent quality of their meat and eggs. Turkeys were first domesticated by the Aztecs in Mexico. Fossils show turkeys roamed Texas 2.5 million years ago.

The turkey (Meleagris gallapavo) is a native game bird of North America, originally found in abundance. from Maine to Central America and from the Atlantic to present-day Colorado. The turkey was first domesticated by the Aztecs of Mexico.The Spanish took the domesticated turkey from Mexico to Europe about 1519.n the 1600s, the wild turkey was a very common bird through the eastern two-thirds of the United States. By 1900, however, hunting and the destruction of their natural woodland habitat had pushed the wild turkey to the brink of extinction.", "key": "75_4", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.303282", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
