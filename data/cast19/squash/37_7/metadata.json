{"input_text": "The study of compliance is often recognized for the overt demonstrations of dramatic experiments such as the Stanford prison experiment and the Stanley Milgram shock experiments.  These experiments served as displays of the psychological phenomena of compliance.  Such compliance frequently occurred in response to overt social forces and while these types of studies have provided useful insight into the nature of compliance, today's researchers are inclined to concentrate their efforts on subtle, indirect and/or unconscious social influences.\nStanley Milgram  was one of a number of post-war psychologists and sociologists who tried to address why people obeyed immoral orders in the Holocaust.  Milgram's findings  demonstrated that reasonable people, when instructed by a person in a position of authority,  obeyed  commands entailing what they believed to be the suffering of others. After making his results public, Milgram sparked direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that \"a common psychological process is centrally involved in both [his laboratory experiments and Nazi Germany] events.\" Professor  James Waller , Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at  Keene State College , formerly Chair of  Whitworth College  Psychology Department, expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments do not correspond well to the Holocaust events:\nThe  Milgram experiment  is the name of a 1961 experiment conducted by American psychologist  Stanley Milgram . In the experiment Milgram had an authority figure order research participants to commit a disturbing act of harming another person. After the experiment he would reveal that he had deceived the participants and that they had not hurt anyone, but the research participants were upset at the experience of having participated in the research. The experiment raised broad discussion on the ethics of recruiting participants for research without giving them full information about the nature of the research.\nMilgram's experiments on obedience to authority are considered among the most important psychological studies of this century. Perhaps because of the enduring significance of the findings\u2014the surprising ease with which ordinary persons can be commanded to act destructively against an innocent individual by a legitimate authority\u2014it continues to claim the attention of psychologists and other  social scientists , as well as the general public.\nResearch has been conducted unethically in other experiments, not in regard to torture but in cases of consent, deception, privacy, and confidentiality. Such experiments include: the  Milgram Experiment  of 1961 (electric shock treatment),  Humphrey's Tearoom Trade  of 1970 (male on male sexual encounters), and the  Zimbardo Guard Study  of 1971 (college student simulated prison experiment) just to name a few. In these experiments the subjects did not always know what they were getting into or were not all voluntarily participating.\nStanley Milgram's  experiment set out to provide an explanation for the horrors being committed against Jewish individuals trapped in German  concentration camps . The compliance to authority demonstrated by people working in concentration camps ignited the question: \u201cAre Germans actually \u2018evil' or is it possible to make anyone to comply to the orders of an authority figure?\u201d  To test this, Stanley Milgram designed an experiment to see if participants would harm (shock) another individual due to the need to comply with authority.  Milgram developed a pseudo-shock generator with labels beginning at 15 volts (\u201cSlight Shock\u201d) to 450 volts (\u201cXXX\u201d).  Participants took on the role of \u201cteacher\u201d and were informed they would be participating in a learning and memory test.  In doing so, they had to teach the \u201cstudent\u201d (a confederate in a separate room) a list of words.  The \u201cteacher\u201d was instructed to increase the voltage by 15 and shock the \u201cstudent\u201d each time he answered incorrectly.  When a subject began to grow uneasy about shocking the confederate (due to voltage level, noises, ethics, etc.) the experimenter would encourage the participant to continue by proclaiming he would assume full responsibility for any harm done to the \u201cstudent\u201d and by saying phrases such as \u201cIt is absolutely essential that you continue.\u201d  To rule out sadistic tendencies, all 40 \u201cteachers\u201d were male and were screened for competence and intelligence before beginning the experiment.\nThe conclusion of the book \u2013 influenced in part by  Milgram experiment s popularized in the 1970s \u2013 was that the men of Unit 101 killed out of a basic obedience to  authority  and  peer pressure , not blood-lust or primal hatred.\nThe  Milgram experiment  ran by  Stanley Milgram  provided some of the most stunning insights into how influential  authority  can be over others.\nHumans have been shown to be obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate  authority  figures, as shown by the  Milgram experiment  in the 1960s, which was carried out by Stanley Milgram to find out how the  Nazis  managed to get ordinary people to take part in the mass murders of the  Holocaust . The experiment showed that obedience to authority was the norm, not the exception. Regarding obedience, Milgram said that \"Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to; Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others.\" A similar conclusion was reached in the  Stanford prison experiment .\nThe Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the  research ethics  of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and  inflicted insight  suffered by the participants. In Milgram's defense, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were \"glad\" or \"very glad\" to have participated; 15 percent chose neutral responses (92% of all former participants responding). Many later wrote expressing thanks. Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants. Six years later (at the height of the  Vietnam War ), one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram, explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress:\nGerman philosopher and anthropologist of law Axel Montenbruck wrote that dehumanization is inextricably linked with both the \" techniques of neutralization \" (David Matza/ Gresham Sykes ) and to the obedience aspects of the  Milgram experiment  and in a wider sense with  Philip Zimbardo 's  Stanford prison experiment .\nWhile most major controversies about unethical research were focused on biomedical sciences, there were also controversies involving behavioral, psychological, and sociological experiments such as: the  Milgram obedience experiment ,  Stanford prison experiment ,  Tearoom Trade  study, and others. There were also ethical issues related to the  CIA 's  Project MKULTRA .\nThe Milgram study found that participants would obey orders even when it posed severe harm to others. This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that \"subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will\".Zimbardo found similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders so much that their behavior turned aggressive. Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards, and because of the psychological duress induced in the experiment, it had to be shut down after only 6 days.\nSome of the guards' behaviour led to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. One third of the guards were judged to have exhibited \"genuine sadistic tendencies\", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized; five of them had to be removed from the experiment early. After Maslach confronted Zimbardo and forced him to realize that he had been passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his supervision, Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become grossly absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as grossly absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment. Ethical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to a  similar experiment , conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at  Yale University  by  Stanley Milgram .\nIn a  Milgram experiment  conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with willingness to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim.\nThe Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of  social psychology   experiments  conducted by  Yale University  psychologist  Stanley Milgram . They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to  obey  an  authority figure  who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal  conscience ; the experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of people were prepared to obey, albeit unwillingly, even if apparently causing serious injury and distress. Milgram first described his  research  in 1963 in an article published in the  Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology  and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book,  Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View .\nPerhaps most damning to the traditional view of character are the results of the experiments conducted by  Stanley Milgram  in the 1960s and  Philip G. Zimbardo  in 1971. In the first of these experiments, the great majority of subjects, when politely though firmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what they thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming \"victim.\" In the second, the infamous  Stanford prison experiment , the planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life had to be ended after only six days because the college students who were assigned to act as guards became sadistic and those who were the \"prisoners\" became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. These and other experiments are taken to show that if humans do have noble tendencies, they are narrow, \"local\" traits that are not unified with other traits into a wider behavioral pattern of being.\nMilgram argued (in  Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View ) that the ethical criticism provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about  human nature . Others have argued that the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment's  methodology . Australian psychologist Gina Perry found an unpublished paper in Milgram's archives that shows Milgram's own concern with how believable the experimental set-up was to subjects involved. Milgram asked his assistant to compile a breakdown of the number of participants who had seen through the experiments. This unpublished analysis indicated that many subjects suspected that the experiment was a  hoax , a finding that casts doubt on the veracity of his results. In the journal  Jewish Currents , Joseph Dimow, a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University, wrote about his early withdrawal as a \"teacher\", suspicious \"that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders, as many Germans had done during the Nazi period.\"\nIn 1961, in response to the  Nuremberg Trials , the  Yale   psychologist   Stanley Milgram  performed his \"Obedience to Authority Study\", also known as the  Milgram Experiment , in order to determine if it was possible that the Nazi genocide could have resulted from millions of people who were \"just following orders\". The Milgram Experiment raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants, who were told, as part of the experiment, to apply electric shocks to test subjects (who were actors and did not really receive  electric shocks ).\nThe  Milgram experiment  was a study done in the early 1960s that helped measure a person's moral character. Subjects from different  socio-economic group s were tested on their willingness to press a  buzzer  that caused a participant\u2014 posing as a  subject \u2014 in another room to express great  pain  and distress for giving a wrong answer to a test question. When the subjects raised questions about what they are being asked to do, the  experiment er applied mild pressure in the form of appealing to the need to complete the experiment. The Milgram experiment caused a huge amount of criticism among individuals.  In post-experiment interviews with subjects Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the wrongness of what they were doing. Although the subjects may have had moral values, many were criticized on whether they were a truly moral character.\nIn  The Journal of the American Medical Association ,  Zimbardo's situational perspective received support from other social situational experiments that demonstrated the same idea and concept. Almost ten years prior to the Stanford Prison Experiment (1971),  Stanley Milgram  conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had \"teachers\" that delivered mock electric shocks to the \"learner\" for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20\u201350 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a \"confederate\" that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, \"I advise you to continue with this experiment\" or \"I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks\" and the one that caught most teachers was \"You must continue with the shocks.\" Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.\nHowever, high agreeableness does not always lead to prosocial behaviour, in a  Milgram experiment  conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with willingness to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim.\nHuman subject research legislation in the United States can be traced to the early 20th century.  Human subject research in the United States  was mostly unregulated until the 20th century, as it was throughout the world, until the establishment of various governmental and professional regulations and  codes of ethics . Notable \u2013 and in some cases, notorious \u2013 human subject experiments performed in the US include the  Tuskegee syphilis experiment ,  human radiation experiments , the  Milgram obedience experiment  and  Stanford prison experiment s and  Project MKULTRA . With growing public awareness of such experimentation, and the evolution of professional ethical standards, such research became regulated by various legislation, most notably, those that introduced and then empowered the  institutional review board s.\nParallels can be drawn to the supposed 'group experiment' element of  Big Brother  which Space Cadets draws on, and in wider terms  propaganda ,  subliminal advertising , and the  consensus nature of reality . See also:  Asch conformity experiments ,  Milgram experiment  and the  Stanford prison experiment .\nBurger's first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram's previous study. The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study, showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time. Additionally, Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender.In Burger's follow-up study, he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study. He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue, the more likely they were to stop the experiment.The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results. They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task, over 90% of them completed the experiment.The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies. They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment (called \"the foot in the door scenario\").In addition to the above studies, additional research using participants from different cultures (including Spain, Australia, and Jordan) also found participants to be obedient.\nIn one classical study, Stanley Milgram (as part of the  Milgram experiment ) created a highly controversial and often replicated study. The experiment involved  deception  of the participants. In the experiment, participants were told they were going to contribute to a study about punishment and learning, but the actual focus was on how long they would listen to and obey orders from the experimenter. The participants were instructed that they had to shock a person in another room for every wrong answer on a learning task, and the shocks increased with intensity for each wrong answer. If participants questioned the procedure, the researcher would encourage them further. The  dependent variable  for this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered.\nMilgram  also conducted two other experiments, replications of his original obedience experiment, with the intent being to analyze the effect of group behavior on participants: instead of the subject being alone with the experimenter, two confederates were utilized.  In the first of the two experiments, \u201cGroups for Disobedience,\u201d the confederates defied the experimenter and refused to punish the victim (p. 130).  This produced a significant effect on the obedience of the participants: in the original experiment, 26 of the 40 participants administered the maximum shock; in the disobedient groups experiment, only 4 of 40 participants administered the highest level of voltage (Table 1).  Despite this high correlation between shock level administered and the obedience of the group in the disobedient groups experiment, there was no significant correlation for the second of the replicated experiments: \u201cObedient Groups\u201d, where the confederates did not disobey the experimenter and, when the participant voiced angst regarding the experiment and wished to stop administering volts to the victim, the confederates voiced their disapproval (p. 133).  Milgram concludes the study by remarking that \u201cthe insertion of group pressure in a direction opposite that of the experimenter\u2019s commands produces a powerful shift toward the group. Changing the group movement does not yield a comparable shift in the [participant\u2019s] performance. The group success in one case and failure in another can be traced directly to the configuration of motive and social forces operative in the starting situation.\u201d That is, if the group\u2019s attitudes are similar to or compatible with the participant\u2019s/observer\u2019s, there is a greater likelihood that the participant/observer will join with the group (p. 134).\nResearch during the past 60 years, starting with the  Milgram experiment , suggests that under the right circumstances, and with the appropriate encouragement and setting, most people can be encouraged to actively torture others.\nThe second half of the film shows how Milgram struggles with the public outcry about the ethics of the experiments and how his career advances as he becomes a professor in New York City and continues to study social interactions and social pressure in more benign experimental settings, including the  small-world experiment , the  lost-letter experiment , the street-corner (or gawking) experiment, the  familiar stranger  experiment, and various experiments that he makes his students carry out. Archive footage occurs frequently, either as recordings that Milgram watches or as a backdrop for entire scenes. Milgram finally dies from a heart attack, at the age of 51. In the final scene, the street-corner experiment is repeated in the present day, with a cameo of the real-life Sasha Milgram. In a mid-credits scene, more archival footage is shown.\nThe practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g.,  role-playing ) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the  Milgram experiment  and  Stanford prison experiment ), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.\nIn 1961,  Yale University  psychologist  Stanley Milgram  led a series of experiments to determine to what extent an individual would obey instructions given by an experimenter. Placed in a room with the experimenter, subjects played the role of a \"teacher\" to a \"learner\" situated in a separate room. The subjects were instructed to administer an electric shock to the learner when the learner answered incorrectly to a set of questions. The intensity of this electric shock was to be increased for every incorrect answer. The learner was a confederate (i.e. actor), and the shocks were faked, but the subjects were led to believe otherwise. Both prerecorded sounds of electric shocks and the confederate's pleas for the punishment to stop were audible to the \"teacher\" throughout the experiment. When the subject raised questions or paused, the experimenter insisted that the experiment should continue. Despite widespread speculation that most participants would not continue to \"shock\" the learner, 65 percent of participants in Milgram's initial trial complied until the end of the experiment, continuing to administer shocks to the confederate with purported intensities of up to \"450 volts\". Although many participants questioned the experimenter and displayed various signs of discomfort, when the experiment was repeated, 65 percent of subjects were willing to obey instructions to administer the shocks through the final one.\nSocial psychologists use experimental methods, both within and outside the laboratory, in an attempt to understand human social interaction. Two widely cited experiments in social psychology experiment are the Stanford prison experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971 and the Milgram obedience experiment by Stanley Milgram.\nMilgram experiment. The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and confederate.\nMilgram's obedience experiment is one of the most famous studies in psychology's history. Learn what it revealed and the moral questions it raised. Milgram's obedience experiment is one of the most famous studies in psychology's history.\nSocial psychology conducts its experiments both inside and outside of the laboratory. One notable social psychology experiment is the Stanford prison experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, although the extremity of this field experiment is not prototypical of the field.Another notable study is the Stanley Milgram obedience experiment, often known as the Milgram experiment.n the latter half of the 20th century, the phrase experimental psychology had shifted in meaning due to the expansion of psychology as a discipline and the growth in the size and number of its sub-disciplines.\nMilgram's Lost Letter Experiment. Classic social psychology experiments are widely used to expose the key elements of aggressive behavior, prejudice and stereotyping. Social group prejudice is manifested in people's unfavorable attitudes towards a particular social group. was only following orders Legal defence by a Nazi leader at the Nuremberg trial following World War II. Social psychology experiments can explain how thoughts, feelings and behaviors are influenced by the presence of others.\nIn other cases, these experiments were also quite controversial. Some of the most famous examples include Milgram's obedience experiment and Zimbardo's prison experiment. Explore some of these classic psychology experiments to learn more about some of the best-known research in psychology history. Pavlov's experiments still stands as one of the most famous in psychology.\nStanley Milgram's experiment investigated the effect of authority on people's willingness to do unethical things, stemming from the experiences of the Holocaust.\nMilgram summarized the experiment in his 1974 article, The Perils of Obedience, writing: The legal and philosophic aspects of obedience are of enormous importance, but they say very little about how most people behave in concrete situations.", "key": "37_7", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.055137", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
