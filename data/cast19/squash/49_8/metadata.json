{"input_text": "Daredevil is available on the  streaming service  Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in  Ultra HD   4K  and  high dynamic range  (HDR). The first two seasons were enhanced to be available in HDR after their initial release by post-production vendor  Deluxe . The episodes for each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage  binge-watching , a format which has been successful for  other Netflix original series . Daredevil was the first Netflix original series to receive its  Descriptive Video Service   audio description  track.\nThe Defenders is scheduled to be released in 2017 on the  streaming service  Netflix, worldwide, in  Ultra HD   4K  and  high dynamic range . The 8 hour-long episodes will be released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage  binge-watching , a format which has been successful for other Netflix series. In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release.\nThe longitudinal study from  Kaiser  saw a drop in usage of the more traditional form of regularly scheduled broadcast TV by almost half an hour from 3 hours and 4 minutes to 2 hours and 39minutes; however, that statistic alone can be deceiving because the consumption of TV content has actually increased daily TV consumption by 38 minutes. Newer forms of media have allowed children to consume television in several ways. Now 8-to 18-year-olds are watching an average of 24 minutes a day of TV/movies on the Internet, 15 minutes watching on cell phones, about 16 minutes watching on iPods. Time-shifting technologies ( On Demand ,  TiVo , DVR/VCR) are also changing how children watch TV. While 59% watch TV traditionally, 41% of consumption is now time-shifted or occurs on a platform other that a TV set (p. 15). In terms of ownership of these new media technologies, from 2004 to 2009 cell phone ownership has increased from 39% to 66% and iPods and MP3 players saw the most significant increases of 18% to 76% ownership (p. 3).\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule. Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and  cable television  programs in effect, often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just  binge  straight into the next episode. Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.\nNetflix's  video on demand  streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on  personal computer s, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including  smartphone s and  tablets ,  digital media player s,  video game console s, and  smart TV s According to a  Nielsen  survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the  Wii , 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a  PlayStation 3  and 12% an  Xbox 360 .\nIn an article \"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch\" (published in  TV Guide  in 1971), Klein explained that viewers consume the medium of  television  rather than  television shows , treating the medium as the end of their consumption itself rather than using the set as a means to access specific programs they like the way they might choose a book from a shelf to access the story within. Since the introduction of television, the same percentage of sets are in use on, say, a Thursday evening at a certain hour, year after year, regardless of what content is broadcast. This is because unlike the way people use books, museums, or the cinema as means of consuming desired content, audiences consume television, the medium, as the desired object. TV viewers turn the set on, deciding to \"watch television\", and then seek out something to watch from what is available, flipping around, not until they find \"something they like\" - because television programming is in fact very rarely satisfying, and viewers rarely watch anything they actually like - but until they find something that doesn't offend them enough to make them flip to the next channel. (Viewers almost never turn off the set as a result of finding nothing tolerable and judging every program available boring or otherwise objectionable. Viewers commonly watch programs they describe later as unbearable, everything else on being even more intolerable. A more common response to a whole spectrum of equally unendurable choices than choosing to abandon the medium is to continue to flip frequently until new choices become available.) Thus, for programmers of television channels, Klein recommended understanding that audience attraction was a matter not of pleasing the greatest number of viewers but of offending the fewest (driving the fewest away to the competitors who may repulse them less). The television audience is in a kind of partial trance. A network will do better worrying less about not giving an audience enough to like, to be surprised and delighted by, and to engage their attention, than about avoiding, as Klein said, \"disturbing their reverie\" with something that causes them to change the channel. Thus, even as channel choices proliferate alongside numerous easily accessed out-of-schedule viewing options, successful television programs remain, as they have always been, formulaic, clich\u00e9, \"instantly familiar,\" predictable, and monotonous in tone.\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Luth Research compiled data for the season, based on a sample of 2,500 Netflix subscribers watching via computers, tablets or smartphones. (Luth Research does not track Netflix viewing on televisions, whether Internet-connected sets or those linked to streaming-media players or gaming consoles.) According to Luth, an estimated 10.7% of subscribers (approximately 4.4 million) watched at least one episode of Daredevil in its first 11 days on Netflix, with 2.3% (940,000) watching on the first day. In a separate study, Netflix determined that the fifth episode of the season was the one to \"hook\" viewers, \"to the point where they [continued on to watch] the entire first season.\"\nA major aspect of the post-network era has been the development of new technologies that change the ways in which television is consumed and distributed. These technological changes have come about with the invention of the  tablet , the use of  smart phones , web-enabled devices connected to the television like many modern gaming consoles saw the subsequent development and wide uptake of  online VOD  services like  Netflix  and  Hulu , as well as specific, network-branded streaming services. This shift in technology created a new-found level of convenience and mobility for viewers, as television trends towards a situation in which you can watch \"whatever show you want, whenever you want, on whatever screen you want\".  Amanda D. Lotz  argues that technologies like  Netflix  and  NBC ,  Fox , and  ABC 's own  Hulu  have clearly impacted the way in which we access television, allowing us to catch up on television shows whenever we please rather than adhering to a first run schedule.  Hulu  also allows for interaction between fans of television shows while they are watching episodes through the site's inbuilt comment feature, creating the sort of immersive media experience and fostering a  participatory culture  of affiliation, two major interests of  Henry Jenkins . This technological change also brings a change in theatricality, as television producers respond to the ways in which their audiences watch television.\nThe widespread availability of  video on demand  on cable TV systems and VHS-by-mail services offered consumers a way of watching movies without having to leave their home. With the advent of the World Wide Web, Internet services such as  Netflix  have become increasingly popular since the mid\u20132000s. All of these new ways of watching movies have greatly reduced the demand for video rental shops.\nNetflix has been one of the most successful  dot-com ventures . In September 2002,  The New York Times  reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers. The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of  DVD player s in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.\nOn April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a  patent infringement  lawsuit in which it demanded a  jury trial  in the  United States District Court for the Northern District of California , alleging that Blockbuster's  online DVD rental  subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first  cause of action  alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the \"dynamic queue\" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered. The second cause of action alleged infringement of Patent No. 6,584,450 (issued June 24, 2003), which covers in less detail the subscription rental service as well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery. The dispute ended a year later, on June 25, 2007, with both companies declining to disclose the terms of their legal settlement, except for a statement by Blockbuster that it would not have a major impact on its future financial performance. Blockbuster also said that the company planned to close 282 stores that year to shift focus to its online service. The company had already closed 290 stores in 2006.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe way people watch TV is changing, and customers need an easier way to subscribe to and enjoy multiple streaming subscriptions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amazon vice president of digital video Michael Paull said in a release announcing the new streaming subscription service.\nThe Best Netflix Original Series. 16k votes 4.3k voters 142k views 47 items tags f t p @.
