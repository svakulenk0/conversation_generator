{"input_text": "Melatonin can lower  follicle-stimulating hormone  levels. Effects of melatonin on human reproduction remain unclear, although it was with some effect tried as a contraceptive in the 1990s.\nMelatonin appears to cause very few  side effects  as tested in the short term, up to three months, at low doses. Two systematic reviews found no adverse effects of exogenous melatonin in several clinical trials and comparative trials found the adverse effects headaches, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness were reported about equally for both melatonin and  placebo . Prolonged-release melatonin is safe with long-term use of up to 12 months.\nCircadian rhythm  disruption is primarily caused by the wrong timing of light in reference to the circadian phase. It can also be affected by too much light, too little light, or incorrect spectral composition of light. This effect is driven by stimulus (or lack of stimulus) to photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina. The \"time of day\", the circadian phase, is signalled to the  pineal gland , the body\u2019s  photometer , by the  suprachiasmatic nucleus . Bright light in the evening or in the early morning shifts the phase of the production of  melatonin  (see  phase response curve ). An out-of-sync melatonin rhythm can worsen  cardiac arrhythmia s and increase  oxidized   lipid s in the  ischemic   heart . Melatonin also reduces  superoxide  production and myeloperoxide (an  enzyme  in neutrophils which produces  hypochlorous acid ) during ischemia-reperfusion.\nSide effects of melatonin may include sleep disturbance,  nightmares , daytime sleepiness, and depression, though the current tendency to use lower doses has decreased such complaints. Large doses of melatonin can even be counterproductive: Lewy et al. provide support to \"the idea that too much melatonin may spill over onto the wrong zone of the melatonin phase-response curve.\" The long-term effects of melatonin administration have not been examined. In some countries, the hormone is available only by prescription or not at all. In the United States and Canada, melatonin is on the shelf of most pharmacies and herbal stores. The prescription drug Rozerem ( ramelteon ) is a melatonin analogue that selectively binds to the melatonin  MT and MT receptors  and, hence, has the possibility of being effective in the treatment of DSPD.\nWhile it is known that melatonin interacts with the  immune system , the details of those interactions are unclear.  Antiinflammatory  effect seems to be the most relevant and most documented in the literature. There have been few trials designed to judge the effectiveness of melatonin in disease treatment. Most existing data are based on small, incomplete clinical trials. Any positive immunological effect is thought to be the result of melatonin acting on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2) expressed in immunocompetent cells. In preclinical studies, melatonin may enhance  cytokine  production, and by doing this, counteract  acquired immunodeficiences . Some studies also suggest that melatonin might be useful fighting infectious disease including viral, such as  HIV , and bacterial infections, and potentially in the treatment of  cancer .\nMelatonin supplements can be beneficial in numerous ways, but there are also side effects of melatonin which should be considered. Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the pituitary gland, located in the brain.Some fruits, vegetables, meats, and other foods contain traces of melatonin.hile not as common, there are other side effects of melatonin supplementation. For instance, in one medical study among men it was found that melatonin causes sperm concentrations to be decreased, and the motility rate also declines significantly.\nMelatonin Side Effects. Melatonin helps to control the natural sleep-wake cycle of the human body. The natural levels of melatonin in the blood is highest at the time before bedtime. Melatonin is a hormone which can affect other processes inside the body.Persons at high risk of getting side effects from melatonin are those with liver disease, seizures, depression, kidney disease and high blood pressure.The long term side effects of Melatonin is still unknown.

The natural levels of melatonin in the blood is highest at the time before bedtime. Melatonin is a hormone which can affect other processes inside the body.\nAs with any medication or supplement, side effects are possible with melatonin. Interestingly, melatonin is more likely to have bothersome side effects if you take it at the wrong time of the day (usually, it should be taken at night).or instance, taking melatonin in the morning is likely to interfere with the normal sleep-wake cycle, possibly leading to daytime drowsiness or perhaps even insomnia at night. Switching to an evening dose may reduce such side effects. Also, lowering the dose may help with many side effects.\nOften, these side effects can be lessened by simple adjustments in the melatonin dosage or in the timing of the dosage. For instance, taking melatonin in the morning is likely to interfere with the normal sleep-wake cycle, possibly leading to daytime drowsiness or perhaps even insomnia at night.Switching to an evening dose may reduce such side effects. Also, lowering the dose may help with many side effects.or instance, taking melatonin in the morning is likely to interfere with the normal sleep-wake cycle, possibly leading to daytime drowsiness or perhaps even insomnia at night.
