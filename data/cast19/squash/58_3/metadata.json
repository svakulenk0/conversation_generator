{"input_text": "Real time activities have an unlimited processor quantum and run without switching unless interrupted by a higher priority real time activity or High Exec activity.  Real Time activities are given control of any available processor that is running something of lower priority.  Interrupts are sent between processors when necessary to ensure immediate availability.  Real time is used by customers to fly missiles, run simulators, and other functions that require immediate response.\nFrom the programmer's point of view, RTLinux originally looked like a small threaded environment for real-time tasks plus the standard Linux environment for everything else. The real-time operating system was implemented as a  loadable kernel module  which began by virtualizing guest interrupt control and then started a real-time scheduler. Tasks were assigned static priorities and scheduling was originally purely priority driven. The guest operating system was incorporated as the lowest priority task and essentially acted as the idle task for the real-time system. Real-time tasks ran in kernel mode. Later development of RTLinux adopted the  POSIX threads  application programming interface ( API ) and then permitted creation of threads in user mode with real-time threads running inside guest processes. In multiprocessor environments threads were locked to processor cores and it was possible to prevent the guest thread from running on designated core (effectively reserving cores for only real-time processing).\nIn some systems and in the context of message processing systems (often realtime systems), this term also refers to the goal of establishing a single agreed sequence of messages within a database formed by a particular but arbitrary sequencing of records.  The key concept is that data combined in a certain sequence is a \"truth\" which may be analyzed and processed giving particular results, and that although the sequence is arbitrary (and thus another correct but equally arbitrary sequencing would ultimately provide different results in any analysis), it is desirable to agree that the sequence enshrined in the \"single version of the truth\" is the version that will be considered \"the truth\", and that any conclusions drawn from analysis of the database are valid and unarguable, and (in a technical context) the database may be duplicated to a backup environment to ensure a persistent record is kept of the \"single version of the truth\".\nIn a sense, any spectrum analyzer that has  vector signal analyzer  capability is a realtime analyzer. It samples data fast enough to satisfy Nyquist Sampling theorem and stores the data in memory for later processing. This kind of analyser is only realtime for the amount of data / capture time it can store in memory and still produces gaps in the spectrum and results during processing time.\nThe key advantage of RTC processing is simplicity. Its biggest disadvantage is that the responsiveness of a state machine is determined by its longest RTC step. Achieving short RTC steps can often significantly complicate real-time designs.\nReal-time Business Intelligence systems are  event driven , and may use  Complex Event Processing ,  Event Stream Processing  and  Mashup (web application hybrid)  techniques to enable events to be analysed without being first transformed and stored in a database. These  in-memory database  techniques have the advantage that high rates of events can be monitored, and since data does not have to be written into databases data latency can be reduced to milliseconds.\nAfter operating a question in the described procedure, the participant can continue to the next question or press a \u201csave\u201d-button in the program, which leads to an immediate update of the median, interquartile range, and given arguments, and then leave the program. A second advantage of the round-less approach is the fact that, in order to take part in the study, participants can login and logout with their personalised account as often as they want during the time frame provided. Their already given answers will be saved and recalled when they login the next time. So, by design of the study, there are no explicit single rounds to answer the questions. Updating and playing back the information to the other participants follow immediately in succession to the process of answering. Here, it becomes clear that the process of answering can be  synchronous  or  asynchronous  and a worldwide  expert panel  can be reached, which is one of the major advantages of web-based tools. Turoff and Hiltz  argue that the issue of asynchronous interaction is probably one of the least understood characteristics of Real-Time Delphis. Zipfinger  points out two advantages of asynchronous participation of the experts: First, they can login to the portal whenever they want; therefore, one could argue that the degree of convenience of taking part is increased for the participant due to a 24h-availability of the portal. Second, panellists can contribute to whatever aspects in the questionnaire they want, especially when having gone through each question at least once. Here, a substantial aspect of Real-Time Delphis becomes obvious: Turoff and Hiltz  explain that a Real-Time Delphi study offers a design of  structured communication  which allows every individual to choose the sequence and speed to contribute to the  problem solution  process. So, in comparison to face-to-face discussions, the Real-Time Delphi approach gives room for individuality and different cognitive abilities of the participants.\nFirebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. The company provides client libraries that enable integration with  Android ,  iOS ,  JavaScript ,  Java ,  Objective-C ,  swift  and  Node.js  applications. The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several  JavaScript frameworks  such as  AngularJS ,  React ,  Ember.js  and  Backbone.js . The REST API uses the  Server-Sent Events  protocol, which is an API for creating HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. Developers using the realtime database can secure their data by using the company's server-side-enforced security rules.\nOTOY first showed its real-time rendering technology at the \"Cinema 2.0\" launch event for the ATI Radeon HD 4000 family of GPUs in June 2008. The technology demonstration, featuring ATI's mascot Ruby fleeing from a giant robot in a photorealistic  New York City  street, used  ray tracing  and  voxel  rendering and ran in realtime on 2 HD 4870 GPUs. An extended demo was shown at  SIGGRAPH  2008. On July 9, 2008, OTOY's CEO Jules Urbach announced that his company had acquired the LightStage technology and unveiled the company's plans to stream videogames using  server-side  rendering. The  Academy Award -winning LightStage technology is developed by Tim Hawkins and  Paul Debevec  at the  University of Southern California  and consists of a dome-shaped capturing environment with several hundreds of cameras and  LED s that can capture different lighting conditions of an actor's performance in real time. The lighting data is processed with OTOY's technology and can be used in a relighting post-process to accurately match the lighting of the environment and characters, both real and virtual. LightStage was used to create digital doubles of actors in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network.\nThis is an era of real-time systems. Customers want to see the current status of their order in e-shop, the current status of a parcel delivery\u2014a real time parcel tracking\u2014, the current balance on their account, etc. This shows the need of a real-time system, which is being updated as well to enable smooth manufacturing process in real-time, e.g., ordering material when enterprise is running out stock, synchronizing customer orders with manufacturing process, etc. From real life, there exist so many examples where real-time processing gives successful and competitive advantage.\nThe rapid increase in the volume of available service, device and sensor data has led to new, real-time market segments which augment the traditional monitoring,  business intelligence  and  data warehousing  domains. The  Internet of Things  promises to bring hundreds of billions of connected devices to the Internet, all streaming out data that need to be processed in aggregate in real-time in order to power smart services that can react and respond to their environment through these sensors. Stored data analytics systems where one continually updates the data store with newly arriving data and re-traverse the stored data in order to perform analysis on the data do not scale up to the very large volumes of data emitted in the Internet of Things.  They are not designed for issuing queries or analyses for each of millions of records per second.  This is where technologies like SQLstream come in, that process the data incrementally and continually, without first storing the data.  Such an approach is called Stream Processing.\nRTLinux realtime tasks get implemented as  kernel module s similar to the type of module that Linux uses for drivers, file systems, and so on. Realtime tasks have direct access to the hardware and do not use virtual memory. On initialization, a realtime task (module) informs the RTLinux kernel of its deadline, period, and release-time constraints.\nIn  computer science , in-memory processing is a developing technology for  processing of data  stored in an  in-memory database . Older systems have been based on  disk storage  and  relational database s using  SQL  query language, but these are increasingly regarded as inadequate to meet  business intelligence  (BI) needs. Because stored data is accessed much more quickly when it is placed in  Random Access Memory  (RAM) or  flash memory , in-memory processing allows data to be analysed in  real time , enabling faster reporting and decision-making in business.\nSince the release (9 September 1995) of  Fraunhofer   WinPlay3 , the first realtime MP3 software player, people were able to store and play back MP3 files on PCs. For full playback quality (stereo) one would have needed to meet the minimum requirements of a  486DX2/66  processor.\nReal-time Analog Signal Processing (R-ASP), as an alternative to  DSP -based processing, might be defined as the manipulation of signals in their pristine analog form and in  real time  to realize specific operations enabling  microwave  or  millimeter-wave  and  terahertz  applications.\nA real-time database is a database system which uses  real-time processing  to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing. This differs from traditional databases containing persistent data, mostly unaffected by time. For example, a stock market changes very rapidly and is dynamic. The graphs of the different markets appear to be very unstable and yet a database has to keep track of current values for all of the markets of  the New York Stock Exchange . Real-time processing means that a transaction is processed fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away. Real-time databases are useful for accounting, banking, law,  medical record s,  multi-media , process control, reservation systems, and scientific data analysis.\nThe RT-kernel (RealTime-kernel) is a modified Linux-kernel, that alters the standard timer frequency the Linux kernel uses and gives all processes or threads the ability to have realtime-priority. (This means, that a time-critical process like an audio-stream can get priority over another, less-critical process like network activity. This is also configurable per user (for example, the processes of user \"tux\" could have priority over processes of user \"nobody\" or over the processes of several system  daemon s). On a standard Linux-system, this is possible with only one process at the same time.\nData from the correlator subsystem are transmitted to a RealTime Computer Processing Array (RTC), which is also located in the CSIRO Data Processing Faciltity. The primary function of the RTC is to run the RealTime Software (RTS); a software suite that performs realtime calibration and imaging of the correlator output. The output information within the RTC/RTS is then further processed, depending on the science mode in operation at a given time. The RTS also writes out calibration data, including bright source measurements, tile gain solutions, and parameters for the properties of the ionosphere abovethe MWA site. The science output files and calibration data are written to an off-site archive for further analyses. The raw data rate is estimated to be ~1 GByte/s with images every 8 s. The real time performance requirement is ~2.5 TFLOP/s.\nOperational database management systems (also referred to as  OLTP  On Line Transaction Processing databases), are used to manage dynamic data in real-time. These types of databases allow you to do more than simply view archived data. Operational databases allow you to modify that data (add, change or delete data), doing it in  real-time .\nSQLstream provides a relational stream processing platform called SQLstream Blaze for analyzing large volumes of service, sensor and machine and log file data in real-time. It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data.  Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard  SQL language , using the  ANSI  standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional  RDBMS  SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries do not exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored.  Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement.  For example, partitioning by a customer id would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer.  This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution.   SQLstream Blaze also allows changes to be made to the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications.  This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application.  Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules.  In this way, it provides an effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data.  SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally.  Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases.  SQLstream is able to execute its queries in an optimized C++ multi-threaded dataflow engine which operates lock-free.  This enables people to create lock-free parallel processing applications easily, which otherwise require specialist skillets and are often difficult to get working and are often error prone.\nThe principal advantages of a real time system are that site operation can be monitored in real time, stock figures are always current, and, with integrated tank gauging, fuel theft from tanks and short deliveries can be identified immediately.\nHartman and Baldwin  discuss further advantages of the Real-Time Delphi approach: First, the number of experts participating in the  real-time study  can be increased due to a higher degree of  automation  during and improved possibilities for analysis after the study. Additionally, the Internet provides the possibility to invite a worldwide expert panel to participate in the study. Second, the degree of interaction among the experts can be increased due to the fact that they can immediately react on others\u2019 comments. Additionally, the time frame between giving own answers and getting insights into others\u2019 responses is very short, which encourages stronger  cognitive examination  with the respective issue in question. Hartman and Baldwin  argue that with the help of this procedure the validity of results is maximised.\nPrior to selecting a realtime recovery strategy or a Real-Time Recovery (RTR) solution, a disaster recovery planner should refer to their organization's business continuity plan which should indicate the key metrics of recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective  Recovery time objective  for various business processes (such as the process to run payroll, generate an order, e-mail, etc.). The metrics specified for the business processes must then be mapped to the underlying IT systems and infrastructure that support those processes.Once the recovery time objective and recovery point objective metrics have been mapped to IT infrastructure, the DR planner can determine the most suitable recovery strategy for each system. An important note here however is that the business ultimately sets the IT budget and therefore the RTO and RPO metrics need to fit with the available budget. While most business unit heads would like zero data loss and zero time loss, the cost associated with that level of protection historically have made high availability solutions impractical and unaffordable. The benefit of implementing a Real-Time Recovery solution is that the investment is substantially reduced from traditional tape based backup products.\nOnce when the  MOS Technology 6502  (used in the  Commodore 64  and  Apple II ), and later when the  Motorola 68000  (used in the  Macintosh ,  Atari ST , and  Commodore Amiga ) were popular, anybody could use their home computer as a real-time system. The possibility to deactivate other interrupts allowed for hard-coded loops with defined timing, and the low  interrupt latency  allowed the implementation of a real-time operating system, giving the user interface and the disk drives lower priority than the real-time thread. Compared to these the  programmable interrupt controller  of the Intel CPUs (8086..80586) generates a very large latency and the Windows operating system is neither a real-time operating system nor does it allow a program to take over the CPU completely and use its own  scheduler , without using native machine language and thus surpassing all interrupting Windows code. However, several coding libraries exist which offer real time capabilities in a high level language on a variety of operating systems, for example  Java Real Time . The  Motorola 68000  and subsequent family members (68010, 68020 etc.) also became popular with manufacturers of industrial control systems. This application area is one in which real-time control offers genuine advantages in terms of process performance and safety.\nReal-time economy is an environment where all the  transactions  between business entities are in  digital format , increasingly generated automatically, and completed in  real-time  (as they occur) without store and forward processing. The real-time enterprise is a giant  spreadsheet  of sorts, in which new information, such as an order, is automatically processed and percolates through a firm's computer systems and those of its suppliers. The core objective of the real time economy is the reduction of latency between and within processes. Latency reduction will reduce capital occupancy costs by occupying assets (physical and labor) for less time.\nTraditional databases are persistent but are incapable of dealing with dynamic data that constantly changes. Therefore, another system is needed. Real-time databases may be modified to improve accuracy and efficiency and to avoid conflict, by providing deadlines and wait periods to insure temporal consistency. Real-time database systems offer a way of monitoring a physical system and representing it in data streams to a database. A data stream, like memory, fades over time. In order to guarantee that the freshest and most accurate information is recorded there are a number of ways of checking transactions to make sure they are executed in the proper order. An online auction house provides an example of a rapidly changing database.\nOne of the problems facing real-time ocean observatories is the ability to provide a fast and accurate assessment of the data quality. Ocean Networks Canada is in the process of implementing real-time quality control on incoming data. For scalar data, the aim is to meet the guidelines of the Quality Assurance of Real Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD) group. QARTOD is a US organization tasked with identifying issues involved with incoming real-time data from the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). A large portion of their agenda is to create guidelines for how the quality of real-time data is to be determined and reported to the scientific community. Real-time data quality testing at Ocean Networks Canada includes tests designed to catch instrument failures and major spikes or data dropouts before the data is made available to the user. Real-time quality tests include meeting instrument manufacturer\u2019s standards and overall observatory/site ranges determined from previous data. Due to the positioning of some instrument platforms in highly productive areas, we have also designed dual-sensor tests e.g. for some conductivity sensors. The quality control testing is split into 3 separate categories. The first category is in real-time and tests the data before the data are parsed into the database. The second category is delayed-mode testing where archived data are subject to testing after a certain period of time. The third category is manual quality control by an Ocean Networks Canada data expert.\nDeWitt and Stonebraker have subsequently published a detailed benchmark study in 2009 comparing performance of  Hadoop's  MapReduce and  RDBMS  approaches on several specific problems. They concluded that relational databases offer real advantages for many kinds of data use, especially on complex processing or where the data is used across an enterprise, but that MapReduce may be easier for users to adopt for simple or one-time processing tasks.\nClusterpoint database enables to perform  transactions  in a distributed document database model in the same way as in a  SQL  database.  Users can perform secure real-time updates, free text search, analytical SQL querying and reporting at high velocity in  very large distributed databases  containing XML or JSON document type data.  Transactions  are implemented without database consistency issues plaguing most of  NoSQL  databases and can safely run at high-performance speed previously available only with  relational databases .  Real time   Big data  analytics, replication, loadsharing and high-availability are standard features of Clusterpoint database software platform.\nReal time is responsiveness of a computer that makes the computer to continually update on external processes, and should process the procedure or information in a specified time, or could result in serious consequences. The 3D computer games or movies are examples of real time since they are rendered by computer so rapidly, it is hard to notice the delay by the user. The speed of  rendering  graphics may vary according to the computer systems.\nReal-time databases are traditional databases that use an extension to give the additional power to yield reliable responses. They use timing constraints that represent a certain range of values for which the data are valid. This range is called temporal validity. A conventional database cannot work under these circumstances because the inconsistencies between the real world objects and the data that represents them are too severe for simple modifications. An effective system needs to be able to handle time-sensitive queries, return only temporally valid data, and support priority scheduling. To enter the data in the records, often a sensor or an input device monitors the state of the physical system and updates the database with new information to reflect the physical system more accurately. When designing a real-time  database system , one should consider how to represent valid time, how facts are associated with  real-time system . Also, consider how to represent attribute values in the database so that process transactions and data consistency have no violations.\nThe amount of research studying real-time database systems will increase because of commercial applications such as web based auction houses like e-bay. More developing countries are expanding their phone systems, and the number of people with cell phones in the United States as well as other places in the world continues to grow. Also likely to spur real-time research is the exponentially increasing speed of the microprocessor. This also enables new technologies such as web-video conferencing and instant messenger conversations in sound and high-resolution video, which are reliant on real-time database systems. Studies of temporal consistency result in new protocols and timing constraints with the goal of handling real-time transactions more effectively.\nNSQ: realtime distributed message processing at scale NSQ is a realtime message processing system designed to operate at bitly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scale, handling billions of messages per day. It promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee.\nKey factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the amount of work it can perform in a given period of time. See the comparison of real-time operating systems for a comprehensive list.\nReal-time is Real time is a level of computer responsiveness that a user senses as sufficiently immediate or that enables the computer to keep up with some external process (for example, to present visualizatio...\nAlso see real-time clock and real-time operating system. Real time is a level of computer responsiveness that a user senses as sufficiently immediate or that enables the computer to keep up with some external process (for example, to present visualizations of the weather as it constantly changes). Real-time is an adjective pertaining to computers or processes that operate in real time.\nReal Time Processing. Real-Time Debit Card Transaction Processing. With real-time processing, your account will automatically be updated whenever a transaction is processed with your Northwest Bank debit card.\nReal-time processing can help banks deliver a blended multichannel experience. For example, consider a customer who has an opening balance of $250. That customer today deposits $750 through the ATM. In a near real-time environment, the customer must wait up to a day or two for the bank processes that deposit before the funds become available. In a real-time processing system, that $750 deposit would be cleared promptly, allowing the customer to make a transaction using the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debit card, whether online or through a smart phone.\nIn contrast, real time data processing involves a continual input, process and output of data. Data must be processed in a small time period (or near real time). Radar systems, customer services and bank ATMs are examples.\nTransactions performed online update databases in real time. This contrasts with batch input, where, for example, a database may not record a purchase until a batch processes it hours or days later. Businesses prefer online input if timeliness is critical to their operation.\nReal-Time Data Processing. An integrated accounting financial system enables you to relay real-time information about your business transactions. For example, if you operate a small hotel business, you can remotely track your number of vacant rooms, occupied rooms and new reservations.his streamlines the information input and output of your management accounting and financial reporting functions. The adoption of an integrated financial system enhances your speed, accuracy and efficiency of processing financial information.\nDiamond Trust Bank Kenya (DTK) Realtime Stock Quote | Nairobi Securities Exchange | myStocks.

Most of the time, processes remain in primary memory in order to provide quick response, therefore, memory management in real time system is less demanding compared to other systems. The primary functions of the real time operating system are to: 1. Manage the processor and other system resources to meet the requirements of an application. 2. Synchronize with and respond to the system events. 3. Move the data efficiently among processes and to perform coordination among these processes.\nFirebase is a cloud services provider and backend as a service company based in San Francisco, California.

Data is everywhere. And better data, captured faster, leads to smarter insights\u00e2\u0080\u0094and better business decisions. DataTorrent offers the leading platform and solutions for real-time streaming data processing for any data type, use case, and industry. Powered by Apache Apex, DataTorrent enables you to build and deploy streaming data applications in minutes instead of hours and reduce the overall cost of operations.\nA TPS can process transactions in two ways: batch and real time. With batch transaction processing, the system gathers transactions over a period of time and processes them all at once. For example, a payroll TPS gathers employees' hours for two weeks and then processes all the hours in one batch to calculate paycheck amounts. In contrast, with real-time processing, the system processes a transaction immediately. For example, when a traveler reserves a seat on a flight, a TPS uses real-time processing to reserve the seat immediately so that no one else can select it.
