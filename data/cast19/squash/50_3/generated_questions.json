Such a program  was under way, Weapon System 117L, which was top secret compartmented. One problem with a reconnaissance was a matter of legality, was there \"freedom of space\" or did a nation's airspace end when space is entered? The National Security Council backed the IGY satellite as it would make good cover for WS117L and set a precedent of freedom of space peaceful civilian satellite. At the same time the NSC stressed that the IGY satellite must not interfere with military programs.  \" The Army's Redstone-based proposal would likely be first ready for a first satellite launch. Its connection with German-born scientist  Wernher von Braun, however, was a public-relations risk. In any case, the Atlas and Redstone ballistic missiles were top-priority military projects, which were not to be slowed by pursuing a secondary space launch mission.  Milton Rosen's Vanguard was a project at the  Naval Research Laboratory  (NRL), which was regarded more as a scientific than a military organization. Rosen and Richard Porter (IGY satellite chief and head of the American Rocket Society) both lobbied for the Vanguard and against using the Altas or von Braun's rockets. They emphasized the non-military goals of the satellite program.

After that, the first Japanese experimental broadcasting satellite, called BSE or  Yuri, was launched in 1978.  NHK  started experimental broadcasting of TV program using BS-2a satellite on May, 1984.  The satellite BS-2a was launched in preparation for the start of full scale 2-channel broadcasts.  Broadcasting Satellite  BS-2a was the first national  DBS  (direct broadcasting satellite), transmitting signals directly into the home of TV viewers. Attitude control of the satellite was conducted using the 3 axial method (zero momentum), and design life was 5 years. The TV transponder units are designed to sufficiently amplify transmitted signals to enable reception by small, 40 or 60 cm home-use parabolic  antennas. The satellite was equipped with 3 TV transponders (including reserve units). However, one transponder malfunctioned 2 months after launch (March 23, 1984) and a second transponder malfunctioned 3 months after launch (May 3, 1984). So, the scheduled satellite broadcasting had to be hastily adjusted to test broadcasting on a single channel.Later, NHK started regular service ( NTSC ) and experimental  HDTV  broadcasting using BS-2b on June, 1989. Some Japanese producers of home electronic consumer devices began to deliver  TV sets,  VCR s and even home acoustic systems equipped by built-in satellite  tuners  or  receiver s. Such electronic goods had a specific  BS  logo. On April, 1991, Japanese company  JSB  started pay TV service while BS-3 communication satellite was in use. In 1996 total number of households that receive satellite broadcasting exceeded 10 million.
