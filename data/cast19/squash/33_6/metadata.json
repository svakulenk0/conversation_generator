As soon as the legal problems were solved, Geissler started a year-long pre-production working with conceptual artist Ludwig Angerer, to ensure the film's design and technical ambitions would fit into a lower budget, along with averting the problems the first movie faced with its effects. Geissler also hired screenwriter Karin Howard, who contributed 14 drafts until the final screenplay, which draws inspiration from most chapters in the second half of Ende's novel. Geissler opted to invite a director only when the development was finished, as he considered effects-heavy productions \"burn a director out real fast when they're in on a picture from the earliest pre-production  stages. What I wanted was for the director to come in fresh and not already worn out and to be able to put his ideas on an already solid structure.\" He eventually brought in the American  George T. Miller , who was a fan of the original film. Over 600 children were auditioned, given the original actors were too old for their roles.

But the studio decided not to build the third stage at the last minute, forcing production to shoot first and second unit on the same stage at the same time. As labour rules regarding child actors limited their working schedules, Miller decided to only rehearse scenes once before filming, and maximized the time with the children on set by shooting with as many as three cameras on every scene. This created a problem as Miller's fear of falling late wound making the film so ahead of schedule the effects team had not completed the necessary work for later scenes.\nThe NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter , directed by  George T. Miller  and starring  Jonathan Brandis  and  Kenny Morrison , was released in 1990.
