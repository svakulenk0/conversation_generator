{"input_text": "Reggae () is a  music genre  that originated in  Jamaica  in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its  diaspora . A 1968 single by  Toots and the Maytals  \" Do the Reggay \" was the first popular song to use the word \"reggae,\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular  Jamaican dance music , the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional  mento  as well as American  jazz  and  rhythm and blues , especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by  Fats Domino  and  Allen Toussaint , and evolved out of the earlier genres  ska  and  rocksteady . Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as \u2018Rudie Blues\u2019, then \u2018Ska\u2019, later \u2018Blue Beat\u2019, and \u2018Rock Steady\u2019. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.\nSome would say that Mozambique's music is similar to  reggae  and  West Indian   calypso . Other music types are popular in Mozambique like  marrabenta , and other  Lusophone music  forms like  fado ,  bossa nova , and  maxixe  (with origins from  kizomba ,  Maxixe , and  samba ).\nBecause popular music tends to be released en masse (e.g., dance music compilations often used by DJs to cover a wide variety of styles),  chutney 's origin as a primarily Indian style may have become somewhat unknown.\nThe popular music originated at the beginning at the 20th century when the first recordings were made. Traditional songs were collected and were adapted so they would have more appeal to the general public. Original compositions with motifs inspired by the traditional music (both  peasant  and  l\u0103ut\u0103reasc\u0103 music ) also started to appear. Some of the most important singers of popular music from this period are  Maria T\u0103nase  and  Maria L\u0103t\u0103re\u0163u .\nAnahid Kassabian separated popular music into four categories; \"popular as  populist ,\" or having overtones of liberation and expression; \"popular as  folk ,\" or stating that the music is written by the people, for themselves; \"popular as  counterculture ,\" or empowering citizens to act against the  oppression  they face; and \"popular as mass,\" or the music becomes the tool for  oppression . A society's popular music reflects the ideals that are prevalent at the time it is performed or published. David Riesman states that the youth audiences of popular music fit into either a majority group or a  subculture . The majority group listens to the commercially produced styles while the subcultures find a minority style to transmit their own values. This allows youth to choose what music they identify with, which gives them power as consumers to control the market of popular music.\nCountry music is primarily a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with  Appalachian folk music , adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. Of particular importance was Irish and Scottish tunes, dance music, balladry and vocal styles, as well as  Native American ,  Spanish ,  German ,  French  and  Mexican  music. The instrumentation of early country revolved around the European-derived  fiddle  and the African-derived  banjo , with the guitar added later. Country music instrumentation used African elements like a call-and-response format, improvised music and  syncopated  rhythms. Later still, string instruments like the  ukulele  and  steel guitar  became commonplace due to the popularity of  Hawaiian music  in the early 20th century and the influence of musicians such as  Sol Hoopii  and  Lani McIntyre . The roots of modern country music are generally traced to 1927, when music talent scout  Ralph Peer  recorded  Jimmie Rodgers  and  The Carter Family . Their recordings are considered the foundation for modern country music. There had been popular music prior to 1927 that could be considered country, but, as Ace Collins points out, these recordings had \"only marginal and very inconsistent\" effects on the national music markets, and were only superficially similar to what was then known as hillbilly music. In addition to Rodgers and the Carters, a musician named  Bob Wills  was an influential early performer known for a style called  Western swing , which was very popular in the 1920s and 30s, and was responsible for bringing a prominent jazz influence to country music.\nAfrican blues is a genre of  popular music , primarily from  West Africa . The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional  African music  from its homeland to the  United States  and back. Some scholars and  ethnomusicologist s have speculated that the  origins of  the  blues  can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by  African-American s during and after  slavery . Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous.  One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation  work songs  with their  call-and-response  format, and more especially the relatively free-form  field hollers  of the later  sharecropper s, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.\nThere is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in  Scotland in the Late Middle Ages . This includes the long list of songs given in The Complaynt of Scotland (1549). Many of the poems of this period were also originally songs, but for none has a notation of their music survived. Melodies have survived separately in the post-Reformation publication of The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567), which were spiritual satires on popular songs, adapted and published by the brothers  James ,  John  and  Robert Wedderburn . The only song with a melody to survive from this period is the \"Pleugh Song\". After the  Reformation , the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like  penny wedding s at which tunes were played.\nScholars have classified music as \"popular\" based on various factors, including whether a song or piece becomes known to listeners mainly from hearing the music (in contrast with  classical music , in which many musicians learn pieces from  sheet music ); its appeal to diverse listeners, its treatment as a marketplace  commodity  in a  capitalist  context, and other factors. Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience ( mass appeal ) or whether audience is of a certain  social class  is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, \"understandings of popular music have changed with time\". Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.\nThe Indian diaspora (and significant portion of other  South Asia n diaspora) enjoy  Indian music , which includes  Indian classical music  and non-classical Indian music. The non-classical music has at least two categories: film music (original sound tracks) and non-film music (often called  Indi-pop ). The  Bollywood music   represents  Hindi language  film songs. Indian diaspora speaking non-Hindi languages enjoy music of their own languages, such as  Tamil music ,  Bengali music ,  Punjabi music  and so on. Fusion between popular Indian music (such as Bollywood or  Bhangra music ) and American music has taken place, and is popular in certain areas with high  Indian American  population density.\nMandarin popular songs that started in the 1920s were called  shidaiqu  (\u6642\u4ee3\u66f2 - meaning music of the time, thus popular music), and Shanghai was the center of its production.  The Mandarin popular songs of the Shanghai era are considered by scholars to be the first kind of modern popular music developed in China, and the prototype of later Chinese pop song.  Li Jinhui is generally regarded as the \"Father of Chinese Popular Music\" who established the genre in the 1920s.  Buck Clayton , the American jazz musician, also worked alongside Li.  Li established the  Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe , and amongst their singing stars were  Wang Renmei  and  Li Lili .  There was a close relationship between music and film industries and many of its singers also became actresses.\nRock and roll  dominated popular music in the latter half of the 1950s. The musical style originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate  origins  lay in a mixing together of various  black musical  genres of the time, including  rhythm and blues  and  gospel music ;  with  country and western  and  Pop . In 1951,  Cleveland, Ohio  disc jockey  Alan Freed  began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase \"rock and roll\" to describe the music.\nPopular African music styles have stemmed from traditional entertainment genres, rather than evolving from music used with certain  traditional ceremonies like weddings, births, or funerals. African popular music as a whole has been influenced by European countries, African-American and Afro-Latin music, and region-specific styles that became popular across a wider range of people. The genre of music,  Maskanda , is popular in its culture of origin, South Africa. Although maskanda is a traditional music genre by definition, the people who listen to it influence the ideals that are brought forth in the music. A popular maskandi artist, Phuzekhemisi, had to lessen the political influence within his music to be ready for the public sphere. His music producer, West Nikosi, was looking for the commercial success in Phuzekhemisi's music rather than starting a political controversy.\nCountry music is a genre of  American popular music  that originated in  Southern United States , in  Atlanta, Georgia  in the 1920s, and It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of  American folk music  and  Western music . The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white,  working-class Americans , who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.  Barn dancing  and other  folk dance  styles would be featured at country music gatherings, and many modern festivals have continued to feature dance,  rodeo , or other cultural aspects.\nMuch of modern  popular music  can trace its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of  African American   blues  and the growth of  gospel music  in the 1920s. The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. There are also strong African roots in the music tradition of the original white settlers, such as country and bluegrass. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the  Ukrainian ,  Irish ,  Scottish ,  Polish ,  Hispanic , and  Jewish  communities, among others.\nRock and roll  dominated popular music in the later half of the 1950s. It evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world.   Its immediate  origins  lay in a mixing together of various  black musical  genres of the time, including  rhythm and blues  and  gospel music ;  with  country and western  and  Pop . In 1951,  Cleveland, Ohio  disc jockey  Alan Freed  began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase \"rock and roll\" to describe the music.\nTraditional  Vietnamese music  varies between the country's northern and southern regions. Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form, and is traditionally more formal. The origins of Vietnamese classical music can be traced to the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, when the Vietnamese captured a  Chinese opera  troupe. Throughout its history, Vietnamese has been most heavily impacted by the  Chinese musical tradition , as an integral part, along with  Korea ,  Mongolia  and  Japan . Nh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c  is the most popular form of imperial court music.  Ch\u00e8o  is a form of generally satirical  musical theatre .  X\u1ea9m  or H\u00e1t x\u1ea9m (X\u1ea9m singing) is a type of Vietnamese  folk music .  Quan h\u1ecd  (alternate singing) is popular in  H\u00e0 B\u1eafc  (divided into  B\u1eafc Ninh  and  B\u1eafc Giang  Provinces) and across Vietnam.  H\u00e1t ch\u1ea7u v\u0103n  or h\u00e1t v\u0103n is a spiritual form of music used to invoke spirits during ceremonies.  Nh\u1ea1c d\u00e2n t\u1ed9c c\u1ea3i bi\u00ean  is a modern form of Vietnamese  folk music  which arose in the 1950s. Ca tr\u00f9  (also h\u00e1t \u1ea3 \u0111\u00e0o) is a popular folk music. \"H\u00f2\" can not be thought of as the southern style of Quan h\u1ecd. There are a range of traditional instruments, including the  \u0110\u00e0n b\u1ea7u  (a monochord zither), the  \u0110\u00e0n g\u00e1o  (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the  \u0110\u00e0n nguy\u1ec7t  (a two-stringed fretted moon lute).\nSega () is one of the major  music genre s of  Mauritius , the others being its  fusion genre   Seggae  and Bhojpuri songs. It has origins in the music of  slave s on the island, and is usually sung in  creole . Sega is also a popular music on the islands of  Agalega  and  Rodrigues  as well as  R\u00e9union  and  Seychelles , though the music and  dance s differs and it is sung in these islands' respective  creole language s. In the past, the Sega music was made only with traditional instruments like  ravanne  and  triangle , it was sung to protest against injustices in the Mauritian society, this particular version of the Sega is known as  Sant\u00e9 engag\u00e9 .\nArt music (also known as  Western classical music , cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, or more flippantly, \"real music\" and \"normal music\") is an  umbrella term  that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. The main tradition in the  Western world  is usually called classical music. \"Serious\" or \"cultivated\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music ( popular  and  folk music , also called \" vernacular music \"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \"serious music\" and \" light music \".\nThe United States has produced many popular musicians and composers in the modern world. Beginning with the birth of recorded music, American performers have continued to lead the field of popular music, which out of \"all the contributions made by Americans to world culture... has been taken to heart by the entire world\". Most histories of popular music start with American  ragtime  or  Tin Pan Alley ; others, however, trace popular music to the  Renaissance  and through  broadsheet s,  ballad s, and other popular traditions. Other authors typically look at popular sheet music, tracing American popular music to  spirituals ,  minstrel show s,  vaudeville , and the patriotic songs of the Civil War.\nResearch on the evolutionary origins of music mostly started in the second half of the 19th century, and was much discussed within Music Archaeology in the 20th Century. After the appearance of the collection of articles \"The Origins of Music\" (Wallin, Merker, Brown, 2000) the subject was a debated topic of human evolutionary history. There are currently many hypotheses (not necessarily conflicting) about the origins of music.\nThe folk culture of Chile has mostly Spanish origins, especially the  huaso  culture of the central part of the country, as it arose in the colonial period due to cattle ranching. It could therefore be considered an offshoot of Spanish popular culture of the 17th an 18th centuries as are the folk cultures of the rest of Latin America and also, its direct descendants, Andalusian and  Castilian  folk cultures. The  Andalusia n forms in the huaso dress is apparent to Europeans and the music and dances show Spanish origins, even though both have been adapted and are distinct from dress, music and dance in Spain today.\nEarly British popular music , in the sense of commercial music enjoyed by the people, arose in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the arrival of the  broadside ballad , which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the nineteenth century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the nineteenth century, including  parlour music  and the  brass band , which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the  music hall  sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s the influence of American  jazz  and  swing music  led to the creation of  British dance band s, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.\nThe original application of the term is to music of the 1880s  Tin Pan Alley  period in the United States. Although popular music sometimes is known as \"pop music\", the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population, whereas  pop music  usually refers to a specific musical genre within popular music. Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable  melodies . The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the  verse  and chorus or  refrain  repeating throughout the song and the  bridge  providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece.\nThe word ya (\u96c5) was used during the Zhou dynasty to refer to a form of song-texts used in court collected in  Shijing .  The term yayue itself first appeared in the  Analects , where yayue was considered by  Confucius  to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of  Zheng  which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.  Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.  It means the kind of solemn ceremonial music used in court, as well as ritual music used in temples including those used for Confucian rites. In a broader sense, yayue can mean a form of music that is distinguishable from the popular form of music termed suyue (\u4fd7\u6a02) or \"uncultivated music\", and can therefore also include music of the literati such as  qin  music.\nPresley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins\u2014repeatedly affirmed by Presley\u2014rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, \"He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\"  Al Green  agreed: \"He broke the ice for all of us.\" President  Jimmy Carter  remarked on his legacy in 1977: \"His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country.\" Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was one of the most famous people in the world.\nKaiso is a type of music popular in  Trinidad ,  Grenada ,  Barbados ,  St. Lucia  and  Dominica . It originated in  West Africa , and later evolved into  calypso music .\nThe Joropo is a   musical style  resembling the  fandango , and an accompanying  dance . It has  African , Native South American and  European  influences and originated in the plains called  \"Los Llanos\"  of what is now  Venezuela  and  Colombia . It is a fundamental  genre  of m\u00fasica criolla ( creole  music). It is also the most popular \"folk rhythm\": the well-known song \" Alma Llanera \" is a joropo, considered the unofficial national anthem of Venezuela.\nThe distinctive themes and origins of Australia's  bush music  can be traced to the songs sung by the convicts who were sent to Australia during the early period of the British colonisation, beginning in 1788. Early Australian ballads sing of the harsh ways of life of the epoch and of such people and events as  bushrangers ,  swagmen ,  drovers ,  stockmen  and  shearer s were popular during the 19th century. Convict and bushranger verses often railed against government tyranny. Classic bush songs on such themes include:  The Wild Colonial Boy ,  Click Go The Shears ,  The Dying Stockman  and Moreton Bay. For much of its history, Australia's bush music belonged to an oral and folkloric tradition, and was only later published in print in volumes such as  Banjo Paterson 's Old Bush Songs, in the 1890s. The lyrics of  Waltzing Matilda , often regarded as Australia's unofficial  National anthem , and a quintessential early  Australian country music  song were composed by the poet  Banjo Paterson  in 1895.\nTraditional (non-professional) polyphony has a wide, if uneven, distribution among the peoples of the world. Most polyphonic regions of the world are in  sub-Saharan Africa , Europe and Oceania. It is believed that the origins of polyphony in traditional music vastly predate the emergence of polyphony in European professional music. Currently there are two contradictory approaches to the problem of the origins of vocal polyphony: the Cultural Model, and the Evolutionary Model. According to the Cultural Model, the origins of polyphony are connected to the development of human musical culture; polyphony came as the natural development of the primordial monophonic singing; therefore polyphonic traditions are bound to gradually replace monophonic traditions. According to the Evolutionary Model, the origins of polyphonic singing are much deeper, and are connected to the earlier stages of human evolution; polyphony was an important part of a defence system of the hominids, and traditions of polyphony are gradually disappearing all over the world.\nAlthough the music industry developed over several decades, popular music drew ethnomusicologists\u2019 attention by the 90s because a standardizing effect began to develop. The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls \u201cpseudo-individualism\u201d; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the public\u2019s tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.\nDistinctive styles of American popular music emerged early in the 19th century, and in the 20th century the American  music industry  developed a series of new forms of music, using elements of blues and other genres of  American folk music .  These popular styles included country, R&B, jazz and rock.  The 1960s and 1970s saw a number of important changes in American popular music, including the development of a number of new styles, such as heavy metal, punk, soul, and hip hop.  Though these styles were not popular in the sense of mainstream, they were commercially recorded and are thus examples of popular music as opposed to  folk  or  classical music .\nModern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western  ballroom  and  social dance  music. During the early 20th century,  ballroom dancing  gained popularity among the  working class  who attended public  dance hall s. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era,  Swing music  was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s,  rock and roll  became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of  soul  and  R&B  music. The rise of  disco  in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s,  electronic dance music  was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of  popular music  commonly played in dance music  nightclub s,  radio station s,  shows  and  rave s. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved.\nThe origins of jazz are in the musical traditions of early twentieth century  New Orleans , including  brass band  music, the  blues ,  ragtime  and  spirituals , and some of the most popular early standards come from these influences. Ragtime songs \" Twelfth Street Rag \" and \" Tiger Rag \" have become popular numbers for jazz artists, as have blues tunes \" St. Louis Blues \" and \" St. James Infirmary \". Tin Pan Alley songwriters contributed several songs to the jazz standard repertoire, including \"Indiana\" and \" After You've Gone \". Others, such as \" Some of These Days \" and \"Darktown Strutters' Ball\", were introduced by  vaudeville  performers. The most often recorded standards of this period are  W. C. Handy 's \"St. Louis Blues\",  Turner Layton  and  Henry Creamer 's \"After You've Gone\" and  James Hanley  and  Ballard MacDonald 's \"Indiana\".\nThe music of  Thailand  reflects its geographic position at the intersection of China and India, and reflects trade routes that have historically included Persia, Africa, Greece and Rome. Thai musical instruments are varied and reflect ancient influence from far afield - including the  klong thap  and  khim  (Persian origin), the  jakhe  (Indian origin), the klong jin (Chinese origin), and the  klong kaek  (Indonesian origin).  Though Thailand was never  colonized  by  colonial powers ,  pop music  and other forms of modern  Asia n,  Europe an and  American  music have become extremely influential. The two most popular styles of traditional Thai music are  luk thung  and  mor lam ; the latter in particular has close affinities with the  Music of Laos .\nThe origin of modern J-pop is said to be Japanese-language  rock music  inspired by the likes of  The Beatles . Unlike the Japanese music genre called  kay\u014dkyoku , J-pop uses a special kind of pronunciation, which is similar to that of  English . One notable singer to do so is  Keisuke Kuwata , who pronounced the Japanese word karada (\"body\") as kyerada.  Additionally, unlike Western music, the  major second  (sol and la) was usually not used in Japanese music, except  art music , before rock music became popular in Japan. When the  Group Sounds  genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular,  Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song \" I Want to Hold Your Hand \" and  The Rolling Stones ' song \" (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction \". Although Japanese pop music changed from music based on Japanese  pentatonic scale  and distortional  tetrachord  to the more occidental music over time, music that drew from the traditional Japanese singing style remained popular (such as that of  Ringo Shiina ).\nPopular music in Indonesia can be categorized as hybrid forms of Western rock to genres that are originated in Indonesia and indigenous in style. The genre of music,  Dangdut , is a genre of popular music specifically found in  Indonesia . Dangdut formed two other styles of popular music,  Indo-pop  and  Underground , together to create a new hybrid or fusion genre. The genre takes the noisy instrumentation from Underground, but still makes it easy to listen to like Indo-pop. Dangdut attempts to form many popular music genres like rock, pop, and traditional music to create this new sound that lines up with the consumers' tastes. This genre has formed into a larger social movement that includes clothing, youth culture, the resurgence of Islam, and the capitalist entertainment industry. Another music scene that is popular in Indonesia is  Punk rock . This genre was shaped in Indonesia by the local interpretations of the media from the larger global punk movement. Jeremy Wallach argues that while  Green Day  was seen as the \"death of punk,\" in Indonesia they were the catalyst for a larger punk movement. Punk in Indonesia calls on the English-speaking world to embrace the global sects of the punk culture and become open-minded to the transnational genre.\nThe Native Americans played the first folk music in what is now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near universal among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of  harmony  and  polyphony , and the use of  vocable s and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use the  flute  and many kinds of  percussion instrument s, like  drum s,  rattles , and  shakers . Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and  Tejano music . Modern Native American music may be best known for  pow wow s, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.The  Thirteen Colonies  of the original United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as  parodies  of the original material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer  pentatonic  tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of  drones ) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of  broadside ballads , humorous stories and  tall tale s, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like  Joe Magarac ,  John Henry , and  Jesse James  are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the  square dance , descended from the  quadrille , combined with the American innovation of a  caller  instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the  Shakers  emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as the  music of the Amish , the  Harmony Society , and the  Ephrata Cloister  in Pennsylvania.\nDuring the 1970s, a number of diverse styles emerged in stark contrast to mainstream American popular music. Though these genres were not largely popular in the sense of selling many records to mainstream audiences, they were examples of popular music, as opposed to  folk  or  classical music . In the early 1970s, African Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City developed  hip hop culture , which produced a style of music also called  hip hop . At roughly the same time, Latinos, especially Cubans and Puerto Ricans, in New York also innovated  salsa music , which combined many forms of Latin music with R&B and rock. The genres of  punk rock  and  heavy metal  were most closely associated with the United Kingdom in the 1970s, while various American derivatives evolved later in the decade and into the 1980s. Meanwhile, Detroit slowly evolved a series of  electronic music  genres like  house  and  techno  that later became a major part of popular music worldwide.\nThe second occasion happened during the period 1965\u20131975 in  New York City , as musicians of Cuban and Puerto-Rican origin combined to produce the great music of the post Cha-cha-cha period. This music acquired the label of 'salsa'. No-one really knows how this happened, but everyone recognised what a benefit it was to have a common label for son,  mambo , guaracha, guajira, guaguanc\u00f3, etc. Cubans and non Cubans, such as  Tito Puente ,  Rub\u00e9n Blades  and many experts of the Cuban music and salsa have always said \"Salsa is just another name for Cuban, music. Tito Puentes once said, now they call it Salsa, later they may call it Stir Fry, but to me it will alway be Cuban Music\"; but over time salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late 1960s  Willie Col\u00f3n  developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms. New York radio programmes offered 'salsarengue' as a further combination. You look at a band of the 1940s playing Cuban music and you will see the same exact instruments in Salsa Music. Later still 'Salsa romantica' was the label for an especially sugary type of  bolero . Even when,  Benny Mor\u00e9 ,  Perez Prado  the greatest Sonero that ever existed, was singing Boleros with a salsa cadence in the 1940s. It was not until the 1950s that Cuban music became popular for Puerto Rican bands. Plena, Bomba an other styles or music were popular at the time in Puerto Rico. Many famous Puerto Rican musicians went to learn the music styles of Cubans in the 1930s and 1940s, and it was not until the arrival of Castro in 1959 and the Cuban music stopped its exportation to the world, that Puerto Ricans in New York were able to be greatly noticed, but what is known as Salsa today, was brought to New York in the 1920s and 1930s by  Dizzy Gillespie  and  Chano Pozo , this last one was discovered by  Dizzy Gillespie  as he was one of the greatest percussionist that ever lived.\nTurkish women in music may perform in one or more genres of music which are the Turkish folklore music, the Turkish classical music, popular music or Western classical music. Folklore music is the traditional music with  Turkish lryics  (see  t\u00fcrk\u00fc ). Turkish classical music is actually the continuation of the  Ottoman  palace music which is also in Turkish. Turkish popular music is similar to western popular music (western melodies with Turkish or original lyrics, new compositions and  arranged form of folklore music).\nIn the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin. Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture. The examples of Africa, Indonesia and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.\nMizrahi music usually refers to the new wave of  music in Israel  which combines Israeli music with the flavor of  Arab ic and  Mediterranean  (especially  Greek ) music. Typical Mizrahi songs will have a dominant  violin  or  string  sound as well as Middle Eastern  percussion  elements. Mizrahi music is usually high pitched. In today's Israeli music scene, Mizrahi music is very popular. A popular singer whose music typifies the Mizrahi music style is Zohar Argov.\nThe blues is a genre of African American folk music that is the basis for much of modern American popular music. Blues can be seen as part of a continuum of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into distinct forms, their  origins  were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily  call and response  vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs. When mixed with the Christian  spiritual  songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of  gospel music . Modern gospel began in African American churches in the 1920s, in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised, often musical manner (testifying). Composers like  Thomas A. Dorsey  composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs.\nAt the same time, popular music developed in the early 19th century, using Tunisian Arabic poems accompanied by Tunisian musical instruments. Popular music includes Rboukh that is accompanied by a  Mezoued , Salhi that is accompanied by a  Ney  and  Sufi music  that are religious songs mainly accompanied by  Tambourin s. This kind of music was promoted by the National Troupe of the Popular Arts, created in 1962. Later adaptation and promotion of popular songs, especially by Ahmed Hamza and later Kacem Kefi, further developed Tunisian music. Natives of Sfax, they were both influenced by Mohamed Ennouri and Mohamed Boudaya, leading masters of popular music in that city. Nowadays, this kind of music is very popular.\nThe history of music on the island of Puerto Rico begins with its original inhabitants, the Ta\u00ednos. The Ta\u00edno Indians have influenced the Puerto Rican culture greatly, leaving behind important contributions such as their musical instruments, language, food, plant medicine and art. The heart of much Puerto Rican music is the idea of improvisation in both the music and the lyrics. A performance takes on an added dimension when the audience can anticipate the response of one performer to a difficult passage of music or clever lyrics created by another. When two singers, either both men or a man and a woman, engage in vocal competition in m\u00fasica j\u00edbara this is a special type of seis called a controversia. Of all  Puerto Rico 's musical exports, the best-known is  reggaeton .  Bomba  and  plena  have long been popular, while reggaet\u00f3n is a relatively recent invention. It is a form of urban contemporary music, often combining other Latin musical styles, Caribbean and West Indies music, (such as reggae, soca, Spanish reggae, salsa, merengue and  bachata . It originates from Panamanian Spanish reggae and Jamaican dancehall, however received its rise to popularity through Puerto Rico.Tropikeo is the fusion of R&B, Rap, Hip Hop, Funk and Techno Music within a Tropical musical frame of salsa, in which the conga drums and/or timbales drums are the main source of rhythm of the tune, in conjunction with a heavy salsa \"montuno\" of the piano. The lyrics of the song can be rapped or sung, or used combining both styles, as well as danced in both styles. Aguinaldo from Puerto Rico is similar to Christmas carols, except that they are usually sung in a parranda, which is rather like a lively parade that moves from house to house in a neighborhood, looking for holiday food and drink. The melodies were subsequently used for the improvisational d\u00e9cima and seis. There are aguinaldos that are usually sung in churches or religious services, while there are aguinaldos that are more popular and are sung in the parrandas.  Danza  is a very sophisticated form of music that can be extremely varied in its expression; they can be either romantic or festive. Romantic danzas have four sections, beginning with an eight measure paseo followed by three themes of sixteen measures each. The third theme typically includes a solo by the  bombardino  and, often, a return to the first theme or a coda at the end. Festive danzas are free-form, with the only rules being an introduction and a swift rhythm.  Plena  is a narrative song from the coastal regions of Puerto Rico, especially around  Ponce, Puerto Rico . Its origins have been various claimed as far back as 1875 and as late as 1920. As rural farmers moved to  San Juan, Puerto Rico  and other cities, they brought plena with them and eventually added horns and improvised call and response vocals. Lyrics generally deal with stories or current events, though some are light-hearted or humorous.\nRock and roll developed out of country, blues, and R&B.  Rock's exact origins  and early influences have been hotly debated, and are the subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from  Afro-Caribbean  and  Latin music al techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to  polka  and  zydeco . Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called  rockabilly , which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, but it was the white performer  Elvis Presley  who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, becoming one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.\nMalaysian popular music has its origin in local musical tradition and popular European music styles. Some of the early musical styles, performers, and songs of  Kroncong  and lagu-lagu rakyat (folk songs) were common to the musical culture of Malaysia and Indonesia. Starting in the 1920s, local social dance and entertainment music such as  asli , inang,  joget ,  dondang sayang ,  zapin  and masri were adapted by  Bangsawan  troupes to Anglo-American dance band arrangement but keeping the local folk character, and developed into modern Malay popular music. The Bangsawan troupes originated in the 19th century as a form of opera called Wayang Pasir that developed as an adaptation of Persian theatre brought to  Malaya  by performers from  Bombay .  They portrayed stories from diverse groups such as Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese, Indonesian and Malay with music, dance and acting in costumes. The musicians were mostly local Malays,  Filipinos  and  Goans .  Famous early singers such as Temah, Tijah and Dean often incorporate Chinese, Middle Eastern and Indian elements in their songs.\nEarly British popular music, in the sense of commercial music enjoyed by the people, can be seen to originate in the 16th and 17th centuries with the arrival of the  broadside ballad  as a result of the  print revolution , which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the 19th century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 19th century, including the  brass band , which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the  music hall  sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s, the influence of American  Jazz  led to the creation of  British dance band s, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.\nMartinique and Guadeloupe are also home to their own distinct folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan  gwo ka  and Martinican  tambour  and  tibwa . Gwo ka is a type of percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into  gwo ka moderne , though traditional rural performances ( lewoz ) are still common. Tambour and ti bwa ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including  chouval bwa  and  biguine , and also exerted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features ensembles of  fiddle ,  cuatro ,  banjo ,  guitar  and  chak-chak  (a  rattle ), with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called  jw\u00e9 . The French Creole folk music of Dominica is based on the quadrille, accompanied by ensembles called  jing ping . Folk  storytelling  (kont) and songs (b\u00e9l\u00e9) are also a major part of the country's musical identity.\nOn the other side of the ocean, Hispanic America is also home to a wide variety of music, even though \"Latin\" music is often erroneously thought of, as a single genre. Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex polyrhythms of African origin.  Mexican music  shows combined influences of mostly Spanish and Native American origin, while traditional Northern Mexican music \u2014  norte\u00f1o  and  banda  \u2014 is more influenced by country-and-western music and the  polka , brought by  Central Europe an settlers to  Mexico . The music of Hispanic Americans \u2014 such as  tejano music  \u2014 has influences in  rock ,  jazz ,  R&B ,  pop , and  country music  as well as traditional Mexican music such as  Mariachi . Meanwhile, native  Andean  sounds and melodies are the backbone of Peruvian and Bolivian music, but also play a significant role in the popular music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia, and again in Chile where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed  nueva canci\u00f3n . In U.S. communities of immigrants from these countries it is common to hear these styles.  Latin pop ,  Rock en Espa\u00f1ol ,  Latin hip-hop ,  Salsa ,  Merengue ,  colombian cumbia  and  Reggaeton  styles tend to appeal to the broader Hispanic population, and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many Hispanics of all backgrounds.\nRock and roll is a kind of popular music, developed primarily out of country, blues and R&B. Easily the single most popular style of music worldwide,  rock's exact origins and early development  have been hotly debated. Music historian Robert Palmer has noted that the style's influences are quite diverse, and include the  Afro-Caribbean  \" Bo Diddley  beat\", elements of \"big band swing\" and  Latin music  like the  Cuba n  son  and \" Mexican rhythm s\". Another author, George Lipsitz claims that rock arose in America's urban areas, where there formed a \"polyglot,  working-class culture  (where the) social meanings previously conveyed in isolation by blues, country,  polka ,  zydeco  and Latin musics found new expression as they blended in an urban environment\".\nMoroccan music is of Amazigh and Arab origins. Rock-influenced chaabi bands are widespread, as is trance music with historical origins in Muslim music.\nCountry music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the  southern United States  in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the  southeastern  genre of United States, such as  folk music  (especially  Appalachian folk music ), and  blues music .  Blues modes  have been used extensively throughout its  recorded history . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as  banjo s, electric and  acoustic guitar s,  dobro s and  fiddle s as well as  harmonica s. According to Lindsey Starnes, the  term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term  hillbilly  music; it came to encompass  Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many  styles  and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of  working-class Americans , who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\nForms of popular music, including  folk music ,  jazz ,  rapping / hip hop ,  pop  and  rock music , have particularly flourished in Britain since the twentieth century. Britain has influenced popular music disproportionately to its size, due to its linguistic and cultural links with many countries, particularly the United States and many of its former colonies like Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and its capacity for invention, innovation and fusion, which has led to the development of, or participation in, many of the major trends in popular music. In the early-20th century, influences from the United States became most dominant in popular music, with young performers producing their own versions of American music, including  rock n' roll  from the late 1950s and developing a parallel music scene. This is particularly true since the early 1960s when the  British Invasion , led by  The Beatles , helped to secure British performers a major place in development of pop and rock music. Since then, rock music and popular music contributed to a British-American collaboration, with trans-Atlantic genres being exchanged and exported to one another, where they tended to be adapted and turned into new movements, only to be exported back again. Genres originating in or radically developed by British musicians include  blues rock ,  heavy metal ,  progressive rock ,  ska ,  hard rock ,  punk rock ,  Bhangra ,  electric folk ,  folk punk ,  acid jazz ,  trip hop ,  shoegaze ,  drum and bass ,  grime ,  Britpop  and  dubstep .\nrock - a genre of popular music originating in the 1950s; a blend of black rhythm-and-blues with white country-and-western; rock is a generic term for the range of styles that evolved out of rock'n'roll..\nWestern Music. The umbrella term 'rock' is used to describe a large variety of musical styles. The origins of this stupendously popular style lie in a fusion of two other popular genres -- Blues and Country, along with significant elements of jazz.\nHistory of Rap \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The True Origins of Rap Music September 23, 2014 By cole mize 189 Comments Rap music is undeniably one of the most popular music genres to date but how well do you know the history of rap? Join me as I take a stroll down memory lane and revisit the origins of what we know today as Hip-Hop. Rap is actually a very old word. You can find the term popping up as early as the 15th and 16th century in Britain. Initially the word rap meant to strike or to hit. A few centuries later a slight variation of this definition appeared which meant to speak or talk.\nAccording to Greg Kot, rock and roll refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S. in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid-1960s into the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll..\nFor other uses, see Pop Song. Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950s. The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles.\nThe Origin of Music. The origin of music itself is very difficult to determine because in all probability, it is likely to have begun with singing and clapping or beating the hands on different surfaces, for which there is no of course no archaeological record.\nAlthough much has been written on the Blues, the origins of the music are not particularly well documented. It is clearly influenced by the work songs of the deep South - ragtime, church music, minstrel shows and folk, even some forms of White popular music.\nDistinctive styles of American popular music emerged early in the 19th century, and in the 20th century the American music industry developed a series of new forms of music, using elements of blues and other genres of American folk music. These popular styles included country, R&B, jazz and rock. The 1960s and 1970s saw a number of important changes in American popular music, including the development of a number of new styles, such as heavy metal, punk, soul, and hip hop.\nRock music is a genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.\nHistory of pop music.
