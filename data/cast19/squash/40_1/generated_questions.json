inhabitants, the Ta\u00ednos. The Ta\u00edno Indians have influenced the Puerto Rican culture greatly, leaving behind important contributions such as their musical instruments, language, food, plant medicine and art. The heart of much Puerto Rican music is the idea of improvisation in both the music and the lyrics. A performance takes on an added dimension when the audience can anticipate the response of one performer to a difficult passage of music or clever lyrics created by another. When two singers, either both men or a man and a woman, engage in vocal competition in m\u00fasica j\u00edbara this is a special type of seis called a controversia. Of all  Puerto Rico's musical exports, the best-known is  reggaeton.  Bomba  and  plena  have long been popular, while reggaet\u00f3n is a relatively recent invention. It is a form of urban contemporary music, often combining other Latin musical styles, Caribbean and West Indies music, (such as reggae, soca, Spanish reggae, salsa, merengue and  bachata. It originates from Panamanian Spanish reggae and Jamaican dancehall, however received its rise to popularity through Puerto Rico.Tropikeo is the fusion of R&B, Rap, Hip Hop, Funk and Techno Music within a Tropical musical frame of salsa, in which the conga drums and/or timbales drums are the main source of rhythm of the tune, in conjunction with a heavy salsa \"montuno\" of the piano. The lyrics of the song can be rapped or sung, or used combining both styles, as well as danced in both styles. Aguinaldo from Puerto Rico is similar to Christmas carols, except that they are usually sung in a parranda, which is rather like a lively parade that moves from house to house in a neighborhood, looking for holiday food and drink. The melodies were subsequently used for the improvisational d\u00e9cima and seis. There are aguinaldos that are usually sung in churches or religious services, while there are aguinaldos that are more popular and are sung in the parrandas.  Danza  is a very sophisticated form of music that can be extremely varied in its expression; they can be either romantic or festive. Romantic danzas have four sections, beginning with an eight measure paseo followed by three themes of sixteen measures each. The third theme typically includes a solo by the  bombardino  and, often, a return to the first theme or a coda at the end. Festive danzas are free-form, with the only rules being an introduction and a swift rhythm.  Plena  is a narrative song from the coastal regions of Puerto Rico, especially around  Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its origins have been various claimed as far back as 1875 and as late as 1920. As rural farmers moved to  San Juan, Puerto Rico  and other cities, they brought plena with them and eventually added horns and improvised call and response vocals. Lyrics generally deal with stories or current events, though some are light-hearted or humorous.", "qas": [{"id": "question_1052", "question": "what was the origin of Puerto Rico", "answers": [{"text": "The history of music on the island of Puerto Rico begins with its original inhabitants, the Ta\u00ednos.", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1053", "question": "What else did they do", "answers": [{"text": "The Ta\u00edno Indians have influenced the Puerto Rican culture greatly, leaving behind important contributions such as their musical instruments, language, food, plant medicine and art.", "answer_start": 100}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1054", "question": "What is improvisation?", "answers": [{"text": "The heart of much Puerto Rican music is the idea of improvisation in both the music and the lyrics.", "answer_start": 282}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1055", "question": "How did the production of the song become popular?", "answers": [{"text": "A performance takes on an added dimension when the audience can anticipate the response of one performer to a difficult passage of music or clever lyrics created by another.", "answer_start": 382}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1056", "question": "What is a controversia?", "answers": [{"text": "When two singers, either both men or a man and a woman, engage in vocal competition in m\u00fasica j\u00edbara this is a special type of seis called a controversia.", "answer_start": 556}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1057", "question": "what is it an example of?", "answers": [{"text": "Of all  ", "answer_start": 711}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1058", "question": "what is the best known?", "answers": [{"text": "Puerto Rico's musical exports, the best-known is  reggaeton.

Blues modes  have been used extensively throughout its  recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as  banjo s, electric and  acoustic guitar s,  dobro s and  fiddle s as well as  harmonica s.

The term country music is used today to describe many  styles  and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of  working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.
