Injurious mutations have practically no chance of becoming established. Far from rejecting evolution, as the title of his 1916 book may suggest, Morgan laid the foundation of the science of genetics. He also laid the theoretical foundation for the mechanism of evolution: natural selection. Heredity was a central plank of  Darwin's theory of natural selection, but Darwin could not provide a working theory of heredity.  Darwinism  could not progress without a correct theory of genetics. By creating that foundation, Morgan contributed to the  neo-Darwinian  synthesis, despite his criticism of Darwin at the beginning of his career.

To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan.

In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case).

De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as  Ronald Fisher,  Sewall Wright  and  J. B. S. Haldane  set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy.

Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in  vestigiality  or in loss of genes. Earlier views that species are subject to \"cultural decay\", \"drives to perfection\", or \"devolution\" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory.  Early scientific theories of  transmutation of species  such as  Lamarckism  and  orthogenesis  perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that  adaptation  through  natural selection  comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less \"successful\"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of  genetics  and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by  Gregor Mendel.  Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the  modern evolutionary synthesis  or neo-Darwinism. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular  allele s. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new  mutation s.

for a synthesis of genetics with evolution, and was enthusiastically received by both geneticists and naturalists. Dobzhansky laid out an advanced account of the evolutionary process in genetic terms, and he backed up his work with experimental evidence supporting the theoretical arguments. This led to the stimulation of the field of evolutionary genetics, and contributions to the theory soon began to follow. This had a powerful impact on naturalists and experimental biologists, who quickly embraced this new understanding of the evolutionary process as one of genetic change in populations. It was not long before the synthesis was broadened to include paleontology,  systematics  and  botany  in a series of notable books:  Systematics and the Origin of Species  (1942) by  Ernst Mayr ;  Tempo and Mode in Evolution  (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and  Variation and Evolution in Plants  (1950) by  G. Ledyard Stebbins. The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by  Julian Huxley  in his book,  Evolution: The Modern Synthesis. In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete.  Developmental biologists  did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that  molecular biology  bridged the gap.
