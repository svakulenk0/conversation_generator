{"input_text": "In A Critique of the Theory of Evolution (1916), Morgan discussed questions such as: \"Does selection play any role in evolution? How can selection produce anything new? Is selection no more than the elimination of the unfit? Is selection a creative force?\" After eliminating some misunderstandings and explaining in detail the new science of Mendelian heredity and its chromosomal basis, Morgan concludes, \"the evidence shows clearly that the characters of wild animals and plants, as well as those of domesticated races, are inherited both in the wild and in domesticated forms according to the Mendel's Law\". \"Evolution has taken place by the incorporation into the race of those mutations that are beneficial to the life and reproduction of the organism\". Injurious mutations have practically no chance of becoming established. Far from rejecting evolution, as the title of his 1916 book may suggest, Morgan laid the foundation of the science of genetics. He also laid the theoretical foundation for the mechanism of evolution: natural selection. Heredity was a central plank of  Darwin 's theory of natural selection, but Darwin could not provide a working theory of heredity.  Darwinism  could not progress without a correct theory of genetics. By creating that foundation, Morgan contributed to the  neo-Darwinian  synthesis, despite his criticism of Darwin at the beginning of his career. Much work on the Evolutionary Synthesis remained to be done.\nDarwin's most important scientific work,  Zoonomia  (1794\u20131796), contains a system of  pathology  and a chapter on ' Generation '. In the latter, he anticipated some of the views of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck , which foreshadowed the modern theory of  evolution . Erasmus Darwin's works were read and commented on by his grandson  Charles Darwin  the naturalist. Erasmus Darwin based his theories on  David Hartley 's psychological theory of  associationism . The essence of his views is contained in the following passage, which he follows up with the conclusion that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause of all organic life:\nObjections to evolution have been raised since  evolutionary ideas  came to prominence in the 19th century. When  Charles Darwin  published his 1859 book  On the Origin of Species , his theory of  evolution  (the idea that  species  arose through  descent with modification from a single common ancestor  in a process driven by  natural selection ) initially met opposition from  scientist s with different theories, but eventually came to receive  overwhelming acceptance  in the  scientific community . The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the  modern evolutionary synthesis  explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream  biologist s since the 1940s.\nThe decades before the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been described as  the eclipse of Darwinism . Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the mechanism of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were  neo-Lamarckism  (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution),  orthogenesis  (\"straight-line\" evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of  Mendelism  and  Hugo De Vries '  mutation theory . Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term  Darwinism  had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of  August Weismann  who went further than Darwin by rejecting  inheritance of acquired characters  and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called  neo-Darwinism . By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the  modern evolutionary synthesis , which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism.\nDarwin's contemporaries eventually came to accept the transmutation of species based upon  fossil  evidence, and the  X Club  was formed to defend evolution against the church and wealthy amateurs. However, the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided\u2014natural selection\u2014was actively disputed by scientists in favour of alternative theories such as  Lamarckism  and  orthogenesis . Darwin's  gradualistic  account was also opposed by  saltationism  and  catastrophism .  Lord Kelvin  led scientific opposition to gradualism on the basis of his thermodynamic calculations that the  Earth  was  between 24 and 400 million years old , an estimate disputed by geologists. These figures were corrected in 1907 when radioactive dating of rocks showed that the Earth was billions of years old. Kelvin's own views favoured a version of theistic evolution accelerated by divine guidance. The specific  hereditary  mechanism Darwin provided,  pangenesis , lacked any supporting evidence. Although evolution was unchallenged, uncertainties about the mechanism in  the eclipse of Darwinism  persisted from the 1880s until the 1930s  inclusion of  Mendelian inheritance  and the rise of the  modern evolutionary synthesis . The modern synthesis rose to universal acceptance among biologists with the help of new evidence, such as  genetics , which confirmed Darwin's predictions and refuted the competing theories.\nPrior to 1950 there was no widely accepted fossil evidence of life before the Cambrian period. When  Charles Darwin  wrote The Origin of Species he acknowledged that the lack of any fossil evidence of life prior to the relatively complex animals of the Cambrian was a potential argument against the theory of evolution, but expressed the hope that such fossils would be found in the future. In the 1860s there were claims of the discovery of  pre-Cambrian  fossils, but these would later be shown not to have an organic origin. In the late 19th century Charles Doolittle Walcott would discover  stromatolites  and other fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life, but at the time the organic origin of those fossils was also disputed. This would start to change in the 1950s with the discovery of more stromatolites along with  microfossils  of the bacteria that built them, and the publication of a series of papers by the  Soviet  scientist Boris Vasil'evich Timofeev announcing the discovery of microscopic fossil spores in pre-Cambrian sediments. A key breakthrough would come when  Martin Glaessner  would show that fossils of soft bodied animals discovered by  Reginald Sprigg  during the late 1940s in the Ediacaran hills of Australia were in fact pre-Cambrian not early Cambrian as Sprigg had originally believed, making the  Ediacaran biota  the oldest animals known. By the end of the 20th century,  paleobiology  had established that the history of life extended back at least 3.5 billion years.\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern  biology . The concept, published by Darwin and  Alfred Russel Wallace  in a  joint presentation of papers in 1858 , was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life , which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional  Darwinian evolution  with subsequent discoveries in  classical genetics  formed the  modern evolutionary synthesis  of the mid-20th century. The addition of  molecular genetics  has led to  evolutionary developmental biology , which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random  genetic drift , natural selection remains the primary explanation for  adaptive evolution .\nPaul Ekman  is most noted in this field for conducting research involving facial expressions of emotions. His work provided data to back up Darwin's ideas about universality of facial expressions, even across cultures. He conducted research by showing photographs exhibiting expressions of basic emotion to people and asking them to identify what emotion was being expressed. In 1971, Ekman and Wallace Friesen presented to people in a preliterate culture a story involving a certain emotion, along with photographs of specific facial expressions. The photographs had been previously used in studies using subjects from  Western cultures . When asked to choose, from two or three photographs, the emotion being expressed in the story, the preliterate subjects' choices matched those of the Western subjects most of the time. These results indicated that certain expressions are universally associated with particular emotions, even in instances in which the people had little or no exposure to Western culture. The only emotions the preliterate people found hard to distinguish between were fear and  surprise .Ekman noted that while universal expressions do not necessarily prove Darwin's theory that they evolved, they do provide strong evidence of the possibility. He mentioned the similarities between human expressions and those of other  primates , as well as an overall universality of certain expressions to back up Darwin's ideas. The expressions of emotion that Ekman noted as most universal based on research are: anger, fear,  disgust ,  sadness , and  enjoyment .\nEvidence for  archaic human  species (descended from  Homo heidelbergensis ) having   interbred with modern humans  outside of Africa was discovered in the 2010s. This concerns primarily  Neanderthal  admixture in all modern populations except  for  Sub-Saharan Africans , but evidence has also been presented for  Denisova hominin  admixture in  Australasia  (i.e. in  Melanesians ,  Aboriginal Australians  and some  Negritos ). The rate of admixture has been found to be relatively low (1\u201310%), and the result is still open to revision, as the presence of archaic markers has also been suggested as being due to shared ancestral traits rather than interbreeding.\nCharles Darwin  had argued that  humanity evolved in Africa , because this is where  great ape s like  gorillas  and  chimpanzees  lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the  fossil  record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like  Charles Lyell , a  geologist , and  Alfred Russel Wallace , who had thought of the  theory of evolution  around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to  gibbon s and  orangutan s, they identified  Southeast Asia  as the cradle of humanity because this is where these great apes lived. Dutch anatomist  Eug\u00e8ne Dubois  favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.\nFollowing the establishment of  evolutionary biology , studies of mutation and  genetic diversity  in natural populations, combined with biogeography and  systematics , led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and  comparative anatomy  allowed more detailed reconstructions of the  evolutionary history of life . After the rise of  molecular genetics  in the 1950s, the field of  molecular evolution  developed, based on  protein sequences  and immunological tests, and later incorporating  RNA  and  DNA  studies. The  gene-centered view of evolution  rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the  neutral theory of molecular evolution , sparking debates over  adaptationism , the  unit of selection , and the relative importance of  genetic drift  versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to  molecular phylogenetics  and the reorganization of the tree of life into the  three-domain system  by  Carl Woese . In addition, the newly recognized factors of  symbiogenesis  and  horizontal gene transfer  introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example:  anthropology  and  psychology ) and on society at large.<ref name=\"Futuyma\">\nSeveral Modern Orthodox Jewish scientists have interpreted creation in light of both modern scientific findings and rabbinical interpretations of Genesis. Each of these scientists have claimed that modern science actually confirms a literal interpretation of  Torah . All of them accept the scientific evidence that the age of the  Earth  and the age of the universe are on a scale of billions of years, and all of them acknowledge that the diversity of species on Earth can be explained through an evolutionary framework. However, each of them interprets certain aspects of evolution or the emergence of modern humans as a divine process, rather than a natural one. Thus, each of them accepts an evolutionary paradigm, while rejecting some aspects of Darwinism.  Shai Cherry  writes, \"While twentieth century Jewish theologians have tended to compartmentalize science and the Torah, our Modern Orthodox physicists synthesized them.\nHowever, Darwinism is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, sometimes called \"neo-Darwinism,\" from those first proposed by Darwin. Darwinism also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, Darwinism may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and  gene flow . It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the  history of evolutionary thought \u2014particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nEvolutionary biology is partly based on  paleontology , which uses the  fossil  record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as  population genetics  and evolutionary theory. Following the development of  DNA fingerprinting  techniques in the late 20th century, the application of these techniques in zoology has increased the understanding of animal populations.  In the 1980s,  developmental biology  re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the  modern synthesis  through the study of  evolutionary developmental biology . Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are  phylogenetics ,  systematics , and  taxonomy .\nSeveral groups of extinct gymnosperms, particularly  seed fern s, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. The apparently sudden appearance of relatively modern flowers in the fossil record posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an \"abominable mystery\" by  Charles Darwin . Recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps.\nBiologists characterize beards as a  secondary sexual characteristic  because they are unique to one sex, yet do not play a direct role in reproduction.  Charles Darwin  first suggested possible  evolution ary explanation of beards in his work  The Descent of Man , which hypothesized that the process of  sexual selection  may have led to beards. Modern biologists have reaffirmed the role of sexual selection in the evolution of beards, concluding that there is evidence that a majority of females find men with beards more attractive than men without beards.\nThe discovery is important for many reasons. Previous to this discovery, the earliest evidence for fully modern humans outside of the Arabian Peninsula ( Tianyuan Cave ,  Niah Cave ,  Mungo Man ) dates to around 40,000 to 50,000 years, so the discovery at Fuyan Cave provides evidence showing that humans migrated out of Africa a lot earlier than previously assumed.  Secondly, the finds at Fuyan Cave are much closer to modern humans than they are to contemporary finds at  Xujiayao  and  Qafzeh . Thirdly, the discovery shows that modern humans arrived in southern China when there was an older, more primitive hominin present in northern China. Lastly, the discovery shows that modern humans were present in Asia at a time when there is no evidence for fully modern humans in Europe (43,000 BC), which is perhaps explained by the presence of  Neanderthals  in Europe preventing the entry of the modern humans.\nAlthough Delbr\u00fcck's  Rockefeller Foundation  fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with  Vanderbilt University  in  Nashville, Tennessee , where from 1940 to 1947 he taught  physics , yet had his laboratory in the biology department.  In 1941, Delbr\u00fcck met  Salvador Luria  of  Indiana University  who began visiting Vanderbilt.  In 1942,  Delbr\u00fcck and Luria published  on  bacteria l resistance to  virus  infection mediated by random  mutation .   Alfred Hershey  of  Washington University  began visiting in 1943. The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel\u2019s experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin\u2019s theory was provided when Thomas Morgan Hunt discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin\u2019s ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code.\nEvidence of common descent of  living   organism s has been discovered by scientists researching in a variety of disciplines over many decades, demonstrating the  common descent  of all  life on Earth  developing from a  last universal ancestor . This evidence constructs the theoretical framework on which evolutionary theory rests, demonstrates that  evolution  does occur, and is able to show the natural processes that led to the emergence of Earth's  biodiversity . Additionally, this evidence supports the  modern evolutionary synthesis \u2014the current  scientific theory  that explains how and why life changes over time. Evolutionary biologists document evidence of common descent by developing testable predictions, testing hypotheses, and constructing theories that illustrate and describe its causes.\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern  biology . The term was introduced by Darwin in his groundbreaking 1859 book  On the Origin of Species , in which natural selection was described by analogy to  artificial selection , a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favored for reproduction. The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of  heredity ; at the time of Darwin's writing, nothing was known of modern genetics. The union of traditional  Darwinian evolution  with subsequent discoveries in  classical  and  molecular genetics  is termed the  modern evolutionary synthesis . Natural selection remains the primary explanation for  adaptive evolution .\nAccording to both genetic and fossil evidence,  archaic Homo sapiens  evolved to  anatomically modern humans  solely in Africa between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Evidence to support the theory that recent modern humans originated in  East Africa  is not conclusive.\nManot 1 is the oldest modern human specimen found outside Africa, dated to 54,700 years old using  uranium-thorium dating . It supports the Out of Africa theory that modern humans originated and migrated from Africa around 60,000-70,000 years ago. This concept has been so far only evidenced by genetic studies. It is possible that it was among the ancestors of modern humans that started to colonise Europe. Its period of existence falls within that of another extinct humans, the Neanderthals. Thus these two species lived side-by-side in the southern Levant. This implies that the Manot people could have interbred with the Neanderthals, the evidence that is so far supported only by comparative genome studies. It is estimated that modern humans share as much as 2-4% Neanderthal genes. Genome sequence of a ~45,000-year-old modern human male from Siberia in 2014 showed that his ancestors interbred with Neanderthals around 52,000-58,000 years ago. But no physical evidence placed humans geographically close to Neanderthals at the putative time of this interbreeding ( genetic admixture ). Manot 1 becomes the first hard evidence for such proximity at the right time. While extraction and sequencing of DNA from the remains could potentially confirm that interbreeding was occurring at that time, the odds of doing so successfully are reduced by the region's warm climate, which speeds up DNA degradation.\nDarwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book  On the Origin of Species , overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of  transmutation of species . By the 1870s, the  scientific community  and much of the general public had accepted  evolution as a fact . However, many favoured  competing explanations  and it was not until the emergence of the  modern evolutionary synthesis  from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the  life sciences , explaining the  diversity of life .\nWith Darwin's theory, a general acceptance that classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of  common descent  quickly appeared.  Tree of Life  representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was  birds . Using the then newly discovered fossils of  Archaeopteryx  and  Hesperornis ,  Thomas Henry Huxley  pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by  Richard Owen  in 1842. The resulting description, that of dinosaurs \"giving rise to\" or being \"the ancestors of\" birds, is the essential hallmark of  evolutionary taxonomic  thinking. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,  palaeontologists  worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups. With the  modern evolutionary synthesis  of the early 1940s, an essentially modern understanding of the evolution of the major groups was in place. As evolutionary taxonomy is based on Linnaean taxonomic ranks, the two terms are largely interchangeable in modern use.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s a modern evolutionary synthesis connected natural selection, mutation theory, and Mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis was able to explain patterns observed across species in populations, through  fossil transitions  in palaeontology, and even complex cellular mechanisms in  developmental biology . The publication of the structure of  DNA  by  James Watson  and  Francis Crick  in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.  Molecular biology  improved our understanding of the relationship between  genotype  and  phenotype . Advancements were also made in  phylogenetic   systematics , mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of  evolutionary trees . In 1973, evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky  penned that \" nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" because it has brought to light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent  explanatory  body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet.\nIt has been said that of all the books that Gould wrote in his career, \"the one with the most impact is probably Ontogeny and Phylogeny ... to say that this work is a hallmark in this area of evolutionary theory would be an understatement. It proved to be the catalyst for much of the future work in the field, and to a large degree was the inspiration for the modern field of 'evolutionary developmental biology'. Gould's hope was to show that the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny is fundamental to evolution, and at its heart is a simple premise\u2014that variations in the timing and rate of development provide the raw material upon which natural selection can operate.\"\nThe work is an examination of  naturalist   Charles Darwin  and the  theory  of  evolution  he proposed and marshaled evidence for in  The Origin of Species . A brief account of his visit to the  Gal\u00e1pagos Islands  brings up the issue of  human origins , leading into a discussion of early theories on the formation and age of the earth and evolution. A biographical sketch of Darwin follows, covering his youth, his naturalistic studies on the voyage of the  Beagle  and subsequent life, focusing on his scientific researches and writings. The history of the theory of human evolution as currently understood is then presented, with sections on the work of  Mendel , the development of the science of  genetics , and the  Scopes Trial . It includes a selected bibliography and index.\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the  Scientific Revolution  from the 17th century and the United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include  Isaac Newton , whose  laws of motion  and illumination of  gravity  have been seen as a keystone of modern science; from the 19th century  Charles Darwin , whose theory of  evolution  by  natural selection  was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and  James Clerk Maxwell , who formulated classical  electromagnetic theory ; and more recently  Stephen Hawking , who has advanced major theories in the fields of  cosmology ,  quantum gravity  and the investigation of  black holes .\nIn 1985 Denton wrote the book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, presenting a systematic critique of  neo-Darwinism  ranging from  paleontology ,  fossils ,  homology ,  molecular biology ,  genetics  and  biochemistry , and argued that evidence of design exists in nature.Book reviews have criticized his arguments. He describes himself as an  evolutionist  and he has rejected biblical  creationism . The book influenced both  Phillip E. Johnson , the father of intelligent design, Michael Behe, a proponent of irreducible complexity, and  George Gilder , co-founder of the  Discovery Institute , the hub of the  intelligent design movement .  Since writing the book Denton has changed many of his views on evolution, however he still believes that the existence of life is a matter of design.\nMany of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin's theory of evolution with  Mendel 's theories of inheritance and genetics. Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky , called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that \" Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs. Nevertheless, some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today:  Louis Pasteur , for example, opposed the theory of  spontaneous generation  with  biogenesis , an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on  chemical evolution  and  abiogenesis . Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.\nPrecise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of  pangenesis . In 1865,  Gregor Mendel  reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the  independent assortment  and segregation of elements (later known as  gene s). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.  August Weismann  made the important distinction between  germ cell s that give rise to  gamete s (such as  sperm  and  egg cell s) and the  somatic cell s of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only.  Hugo de Vries  connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the  cell nucleus  and when expressed they could move into the  cytoplasm  to change the  cell s structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as  Ronald Fisher ,  Sewall Wright  and  J. B. S. Haldane  set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and  Mendelian inheritance  was thus reconciled.\nThe 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life  is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous  Vestiges of Creation  had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and  common descent  by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.\nThe theory is supported by both genetic and fossil evidence. The hypothesis originated in the 19th century, with Charles Darwin's  Descent of Man , but remained speculative until the 1980s when it was supported by study of present-day mitochondrial DNA, combined with evidence from  physical anthropology  of archaic  specimens . A large study published in 2009 found that modern humans probably originated near the border of  Namibia  and South Africa (reported as Namibia and  Angola  by BBC), and some left Africa through East Africa. Observations consistent with this are that Africa contains the most human genetic diversity anywhere on Earth, and the genetic structure of Africans traces to 14 ancestral population clusters that correlate with ethnicity and culture or language. The study lasted ten years and analyzed variations at 1,327 DNA markers of 121 African populations, 4 African American populations, and 60 non-African populations.\nThe recent African origin of modern humans is the mainstream model that describes the origin and  early dispersal  of  anatomically modern humans .  The theory is called the (Recent) Out-of-Africa model in the popular press, and academically the recent single-origin hypothesis (RSOH), Replacement Hypothesis, and Recent African Origin (RAO) model.  The hypothesis that humans have a single origin (monogenesis) was published in  Charles Darwin 's  Descent of Man  (1871).  The concept was speculative until the 1980s, when it was corroborated by a study of present-day  mitochondrial DNA , combined with evidence based on  physical anthropology  of archaic  specimens .  According to genetic and fossil evidence,  archaic Homo sapiens  evolved to  anatomically modern humans  solely in  Africa , between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, with members of one branch leaving Africa by 60,000 years ago and over time replacing earlier human populations such as  Neanderthals  and  Homo erectus .\nIn the early 20th century the  modern evolutionary synthesis  integrated  classical genetics  with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of  population genetics . The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of  biology . Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as  orthogenesis ,  evolutionism , and other beliefs about innate \"progress\" within the  largest-scale trends in evolution , became  obsolete scientific theories . Scientists continue to study various aspects of  evolutionary biology  by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing  mathematical models of theoretical biology  and biological theories, using  observational data , and performing  experiment s in both the  field  and the laboratory.\nThe idea of de-evolution is based at least partly on the presumption that \"evolution\" requires some sort of  purposeful direction  towards \" increasing complexity \". Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in  vestigiality  or in loss of genes. Earlier views that species are subject to \"cultural decay\", \"drives to perfection\", or \"devolution\" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory.  Early scientific theories of  transmutation of species  such as  Lamarckism  and  orthogenesis  perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that  adaptation  through  natural selection  comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less \"successful\"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of  genetics  and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by  Gregor Mendel .  Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the  modern evolutionary synthesis  or neo-Darwinism. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular  allele s. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new  mutation s. Selection also might arise from more complex  epigenetic  or other  chromosomal  changes, but the fundamental requirement is that any adaptive effect must be  heritable .\nThe modern understanding of evolution began with the 1859 publication of  Charles Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species . In addition,  Gregor Mendel 's work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of  genetics . Fossil discoveries in  paleontology , advances in  population genetics  and a global network of scientific research have provided further details into the mechanisms of evolution. Scientists now have a good understanding of the origin of new species ( speciation ) and have observed the speciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal  scientific theory  that  biologist s use to understand life and is used in many disciplines, including  medicine ,  psychology ,  conservation biology ,  anthropology ,  forensics ,  agriculture  and other  social-cultural  applications.\nGenetics and the Origin of Species provided the outline for a synthesis of genetics with evolution, and was enthusiastically received by both geneticists and naturalists. Dobzhansky laid out an advanced account of the evolutionary process in genetic terms, and he backed up his work with experimental evidence supporting the theoretical arguments. This led to the stimulation of the field of evolutionary genetics, and contributions to the theory soon began to follow. This had a powerful impact on naturalists and experimental biologists, who quickly embraced this new understanding of the evolutionary process as one of genetic change in populations. It was not long before the synthesis was broadened to include paleontology,  systematics  and  botany  in a series of notable books:  Systematics and the Origin of Species  (1942) by  Ernst Mayr ;  Tempo and Mode in Evolution  (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and  Variation and Evolution in Plants  (1950) by  G. Ledyard Stebbins . The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by  Julian Huxley  in his book,  Evolution: The Modern Synthesis . In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete.  Developmental biologists  did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that  molecular biology  bridged the gap. Also, for decades there was disagreement over whether the unit of selection was the gene or the individual as a whole.\nIn The Guardian, Steven Poole criticises Wolfe's whole approach to Darwin and dismisses his suggestion that Darwin had no evidence for his theory of evolution, saying that Darwin 'adduced a lot of evidence at the time, including the geographical distribution of species, comparative anatomy, fossils and the existence of vestigial organs. Today, of course, evolution is observed in real time in the laboratory, among microbes or insects'.\nThe theory of evolution is a scientific theory that can be tested by observations and application of the scientific method. Support for the theory of evolution is based on fossil evidence that has accumulated throughout the geologic history of the Earth. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a contemporary example of the adaptation of life-forms in response to their environment.

Here we will look at these evidences and briefly make note of some of the criticism levied against them by opponents of Darwin s theory.\nDNA evidence also marks liverworts as the modern land plants that appeared earliest; liverworts have the simplest plant bodies and reproduction of all plant groups. The ancient microfossils thought to represent the remains of the earliest plants are very similar to the components of modern liverworts.he balance of evidence strongly indicates that all of the modern land plants are derived from a single common ancestor (i.e., they are monophyletic), and that this ancestor resembled modern Coleochaete and Charales.\nThe idea that, along with other life forms, modern-day humans evolved from an ancient, common ancestor was proposed by Robert Chambers in 1844 and taken up by Charles Darwin in 1871.Modern humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking apes that has been traced back over 6 Ma to Sahelanthropus.evertheless, the great majority of animals, plants, fungi and protists reproduce sexually. There is strong evidence that sexual reproduction arose early in the history of eukaryotes and that the genes controlling it have changed very little since then.\nThe development of antibiotic and pesticide resistance is often presented as a modern example of evolution by mutations and as clear evidence for Darwinism.\nDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection underlies all modern biology. It enables us to decipher our genes and fight viruses, and to understand Earth's fossil record and rich biodiversity. Simple yet at times controversial, misunderstood and misused for social goals, the theory remains unchallenged as the central concept of biology. Charles Darwin, reluctant revolutionary, profoundly altered our view of the natural world and our place in it. Charles Darwin looked closely at life. The vast and marvelous diversity of life on Earth, from barnacles to butterflies, ostriches to orchids, made him curious.\nThere are two theories about the origin of modern humans: 1) they arose in one place\u00e2\u0080\u0094Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0094and 2) premodern humans migrated from Africa to become modern humans in other parts of the world. Most evidence points to the first theory because\nmajor pieces of evidence for this theory can be broken down into the fossil record, embryology, comparative anatomy, and molecular biology. Fossils.
