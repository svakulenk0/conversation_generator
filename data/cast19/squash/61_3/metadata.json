{"input_text": "The Sentry is recruited by  Tony Stark  to be part of the  Mighty Avengers , the newest incarnation of the Avengers team.

He opined that \"Avengers Assembled! will be an essential product for most players of the game\". He stated: \"Personal preferences aside, the Avengers are probably the ideal group to choose if you are going to run an extended campaign using MSH. There have been so many members and roster changes that your players are almost certain to be able to pick a character each without conflict over who plays which particular favourite, or someone getting lumbered with a character that doesn't suit their style of play.\" He continued: \"There are a few grossly powerful characters among them, and I'd recommend that  Thor  in particular be kept as an  NPC  who can rescue the players in times of dire emergency, but the only real wimps,  Wasp  and  Hawkeye , are among the most interesting characters to play. My only complaint is that many of the villains are also very tough, the sort of folks who take on the Avengers single-handed and are normally only defeated thanks to their arrogance and over-confidence, and will therefore be quite difficult for the  GM  to handle.\" Tamlyn concluded by saying: \"Overall, a much-needed publication which will sell very well.\"\nThor, a founding member of the superhero group the  Avengers , often battles his evil adoptive brother  Loki , a Marvel character adapted from the Norse god of mischief.

We saw how the  Avengers  came together. That was some of the best of times and some of the worst of times for them...Often times, when heroes get together, it doesn\u2019t quite go as smoothly as you\u2019d like it to go.\" Loeb added, \"It's not about who's the bad guy or what's at stake or any of those things. We're still working in a really grounded world. The sky's not going to open up and aliens aren't going to come flying out of it. That's the Avengers' job, that's what they're supposed to do. The street level heroes always come from a very real place.\" Regarding the antagonist, Ramirez said, \"It's never an option for us in these shows to do the Defenders in space,\" calling it a street level New York story. He continued, \"The challenge here is we've got four really powerful people teaming together and so we need to come up with something that's worthy of their fists and fury... It's really hard, though. They're so powerful when all four of them are together. You're like, who is a challenge?\"\nAs Onslaught appeared in Counter-Earth he became larger, and regained his Magneto-like mask. He soon encountered the Avengers and was presumed defeated after he fell into the ocean. Instead of worrying about Onslaught, the Avengers questioned Franklin's credibility, as Franklin claimed to be the son of both Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. On Counter-Earth Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman were not married and did not have children. Shortly after this, Thor was assaulted by an Onslaught-possessed Hulk, who battled Thor to determine which of the two was more powerful. Onslaught switched between the bodies and possessed Thor, who struck the Hulk with lightning. As Thor was about to strike again, he dropped his hammer, as Onslaught was not worthy to carry it. Onslaught switched back to the Hulk, and punched Thor into the atmosphere. Onslaught was assaulted by the Avengers before he could pick up Thor's hammer. Captain America ordered the Human Torch and Iron Man to rescue Thor, telling them they had about sixty seconds for the rescue. They raced to save him, and Johnny took Thor back to the  Baxter Building , where Mr. Fantastic discovered that Franklin really was his son. In the battle,  Captain America  ordered  Hawkeye  to find Onslaught, and confronted Hawkeye with the fact that Wolverine was hiding in Hawkeye's costume. The Avengers continued to battle the Hulk, while Captain America was thrown into a building.  Iron Man , from the atmosphere, charged down at the Hulk at full speed, hoping that Bruce would forgive him someday. He punched the Hulk, knocking him out. He and Captain America assessed their next move until Onslaught possessed Iron Man and attacked Captain America. Back at  Avengers Mansion ,  Rikki Barnes  was babysitting Franklin when  Loki ,  Executioner , Scarlet Witch,  Enchantress , and Ultron V surprised them with an offer to help defeat Onslaught. On a balcony, an invisible  Ant-Man  and the Invisible Woman let themselves be known, as Sue refused to let the villains cause Franklin any harm.\nWhenever you start talking about teams of heroes, the question of who is the most powerful comes up pretty quickly.
