{"version": "squash-2.0", "data": [{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Captain America is seen as the leader of the  Avengers  during the  JLA/Avengers  story. His mind affected by subtle incompatibilities between the two universes, he sees the  Justice League  as overlords who demand praise and worship in return for heroic actions. He especially gets angry at  Superman, who (likewise affected) sees the Avengers as heroes who don't do enough and let their world down. During the first confrontation, Cap and  Batman  battle but reach a standstill, Batman saying it is conceivable Cap could beat him, but asks if he wants to. The two decide to team up to solve the mystery of the game. At the  Bat-Cave  Cap comments on the fact Batman lost  a partner, possibly thinking of  Bucky Barnes. They figure out the plan after Cap gets an inter-dimensional vehicle from the FF that allow them to get to the Grandmaster's headquarters, where they encounter the  Atom, who shows them recordings of the event, revealing the Avengers are fighting for  Krona. Their intervention in the last battle, where Cap makes sure Batman can get the cube so the JLA wins the game by using his shield to get the cube from Quicksilver, causes the villain Krona to go mad and attack the Grandmaster. Cap and Batman together convince the two teams to fight Krona. The Grandmaster then causes the two universes to merge, imprisoning Krona between them. Cap is the only Marvel hero to sense reality changing and his attack on Superman, who also realises the changes, shatters the fixed reality. He commands a group of heroes from both worlds in a wintry Metropolis when they are attacked by a group of villains. He and Superman again argue after he realizes Krona, from the DC Universe is responsible for the chaos, but are stopped by  Wonder Woman. The two teams find the  Grandmaster, who shows them the way their realities are supposed to be. Despite seeing shocking revelations, the two teams decide to face Krona. Cap leads the teams as a battle tactician at Superman's suggestion, communicating orders through the  Martian Manhunter's telepathy, and gives Superman his shield. Before the battle he and Superman apologize to each other, claiming they each have fears of doing what the other accused them of. During the battle Cap is confronted by  Prometheus  after the Martian Manhunter is brought down by chronal chaos, whom he defeats despite them uploading Batman's skills after he gets his shield back. His ideas ultimately defeat Krona, after  Flash  and  Hawkeye  are nearly killed by  Dreamslayer, he tells them to pretend they are dead and lay low, they stop Krona's plan after he has defeated all the other heroes. Cap is among the core heroes at the end when reality is restored.

Cadmus ) was featured as an adversary of the Justice League in the first season (third overall) of animated series Justice League Unlimited. It is described by Emil Hamilton as \"Power brokers, politicians, criminals, and black-ops mercenaries with one thing in common: they're humanity's last hope against (metahumans)\". This version is a combination of the comics version of Cadmus, the Suicide Squad (which appeared in the series as Task Force X, its real name in the comics), and Checkmate. In the series, Cadmus is a government project designed to take precautions against the League going rogue. The project was started when Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid into invading Earth at the end of Superman: The Animated Series where the project (called \"Project: Achilles\") was designed to deal with the Man of Steel if he were to attack the Earth again. It was created by Lex Luthor, and a mutual ally bigoted General Nathaniel Hardcastle who was later killed by Galatea on orders of Cadmus. The project's goals extended to the Justice League as well after the Justice Lords incident. Members of this version of Cadmus include Amanda Waller, Professor Hamilton, Tala, General Wade Eiling, Professor Milo, Maxwell Lord, Hugo Strange, and Doctor Moon. For a short while, they also had turned Captain Atom to their cause. In addition, they also had Task Force X, which is the official name for the organization known in DC Comics as the Suicide Squad, for use in risky field missions. Cadmus was later shown to be backed by Lex Luthor, who only financed the project in a grab for superpowers of his own; a new AMAZO robot with Luthor's conscious mind implanted in it. After taking what he needed to build it from Cadmus and learning the League had figured out his link to the organization, Luthor attempted to destroy the organization by hacking into an immense laser built into the League's Watchtower. Although the building was destroyed, Waller \"had the facility scrubbed as per standard protocol\" after Superman and Huntress broke into to rescue The Question from Moon's captivity. It was then revealed that Brainiac was living inside Luthor at the time, improving upon his physical health and strength while \"subtly influencing (his) actions\". After they were confronted by Batman and then the rest of the founding members of the Justice League, which Waller had released from custody, Luthor and Braniac escaped to Washington, D.C. to a Cadmus building in order to merge with the Dark Heart, a nanotechnology-like alien being which the League defeated thanks to Atom. After both of them were defeated, Cadmus ceased operations against the League and the Justice League announced the establishment of a planetside base to improve their public relations. However, there were a few former members of Cadmus who were still against the Justice League, such as Tala, who ends up joinning Gorrila Grodd's Secret Society and General Eiling. Project Cadmus was responsible for creating the characters Galatea (a clone of Supergirl who resembles Power Girl), Doomsday, the Royal Flush Gang, Volcana, the Ultimen (a team of genetically engineered heroes who are a pastiche of several heroes created for the Super Friends series) and ultimately Terry McGinnis (Batman II). When the Joker took the Royal Flush Gang from Cadmus, he also stole some technology he would later use to overwrite his DNA into Tim Drake during Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker as explained in Epilogue. Elements of the organization were later brought together to initiate 'Project Batman Beyond', to ensure that, in some form or another, there \"would always be a Batman\". Thus Cadmus is responsible for the continuation of the DC Animated Universe storyline into the future.", "qas": [{"id": "question_527", "question": "What is Cadmus?", "answers": [{"text": "Project

His status as either a full, reserve, or honorary member of the League is debatable.  After a vote of the majority of the team in Justice League of America #103, they offered him membership, with Superman declaring the Stranger \"a member\" without qualification, though he left before accepting. This issue was part of an unofficial  metafiction al  crossover  with  Marvel Comics, spanning titles from both of the major comics companies. Beginning in Marvel's  Amazing Adventures  #16 (by  Steve Englehart  with art by  Bob Brown  and  Frank McLaughlin ), the story continued in DC's Justice League of America #103 (by Len Wein,  Dick Dillin  and  Dick Giordano ), and is concluded in  Thor (Marvel Comics)  #207 (by  Gerry Conway  and penciler  John Buscema ). Each comic featured writers Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, and Len Wein, as well as Wein's first wife  Glynis,  interacting with  Marvel or DC characters at the  Rutland Halloween Parade  in  Rutland, Vermont.  The Phantom Stranger has at least twice asserted his membership status when other Leaguers challenged his input, during the vote on the League's re-admission of  Wonder Woman  and during the crossover with The  Avengers. In contrast, many in-story accounts of League membership fail to include the Stranger; when Zatanna was admitted as a member, Superman and Hawkman clarified that the twelve-member limit in the League's charter had been rewritten previously to admit Hawkgirl as the thirteenth. Writer Len Wein commented on the Phantom Stranger's relationship with the JLA in a 2012 interview stating that the character \"only sort of joined. He was offered membership but vanished, as per usual, without actually accepting the offer.

However, the actions of the Justice League in their quest to justify  Sue Dibny's  death are challenged by the seemingly reoccurring theme of  revenge. It can be considered a conflicting matter when determining what is considered justice and what is considered revenge. Justice is more commonly viewed as resolving a matter politically and/or ethically while revenge is seen as imposing suffering on an individual who has made another suffer. The Justice League has the desire for retribution for Sue Dibny's death, however the question lies in the matter of where this desire comes from: personal revenge or unbiased justice. Many factors go into determining what motive the Justice League had in their investigation of Sue's death in terms of revenge and justice. In regards to the characters in the Justice League, the connotation of their title as \"Justice League\" plays a major role in how their actions can be perceived as justifiable. It can be a preconceived misconception to give the Justice League assured justification in any of their actions, seeing as how their title can lead one to believe their actions are based off their \"police\" force resemblance. Therefore their actions in the finding of Sue Dibny's killer can be easily observed as acts of justice and of ethical value. Contrarily, these actions can be viewed as an act of revenge carried out by vigilantes. An aspect of the League's situation that makes it susceptible to be viewed as revenge is that it is a personal matter, seeing as how a member in the league (Ralph Dibny) is personally effected from crime. It can be argued that Ralph Dibny, having gone through the suffering of losing his wife, is seeking revenge and the imposition of suffering for the one(s) who is found guilty for the death of his wife.

opening two episodes of season 1) aired a month prior to the debut of the regular series and introduced four characters:  Robin,  Aqualad,  Kid Flash, and  Speedy. It established their desire for greater recognition and respect, namely, a promotion from sidekicks to full-fledged superheroes. Met with opposition from their respective mentors in the Justice League,  Batman,  Aquaman,  Flash, and  Green Arrow, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s react in different ways. Speedy resigns from being Green Arrow's partner and begins calling himself Red Arrow. The others seek to persuade their mentors of their worth by secretly taking on a Justice League mission to investigate the  Cadmus  building. During their infiltration of Cadmus' headquarters, the three heroes find a clone of  Superman  named  Superboy. After the discovery, the team finds out Cadmus is creating living weapons called Genomorphs. The episode deals with this revelation, the origin of Superboy, and how this relates to a mysterious group of people called the Light. In the end, Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, and Superboy negotiate with Batman to organize a covert operations team as a practical contrast to the Justice League, whose celebrity status makes it difficult to maintain secrecy or initiate stealth operations.

(Subsequent episodes touched on her attempts to adjust to her new world). In an interview segment on the Season One DVD, Bruce Timm stated that he initially ran into some legal issues in using the Wonder Woman character, but was adamant that she be used in the series. Additionally, the character of  The Flash  was portrayed as somewhat younger and significantly more brash than his comic book counterpart, taking on a number of personality traits of  Plastic Man, who provides a similar comic relief function in the JLA comics. Major changes were also made to the Hawkgirl character. The character of Hawkgirl became romantically involved with the John Stewart Green Lantern as the series progressed. A romantic relationship between Batman and Wonder Woman was also \"shown\" (hinted at but never \"official\" unlike Hawkgirl/Green Lantern) by the show's creators, who disliked pairing Wonder Woman with Superman despite fan requests.  Robin  is not paired with Batman in this animated series like he was on  Super Friends. Although the series itself is animated in traditional 2-dimensional style, the opening credits are rendered in 3D with  toon shading. The intro is a \"stock\" intro used throughout the series until Justice League Unlimited premieres.", "qas": [{"id": "question_1371", "question": "What was the origin of the DC Universe?", "answers": [{"text": "Most of the characters retained their general comic book origins and continuity, with  Wonder Woman  being the notable exception.", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1372", "question": "What else can you tell me about the series?", "answers": [{"text": "In the Justice League series continuity, the premiere story arc \"Secret Origins\" revises the plot of Diana's competition against her fellow Amazons to be the ambassador of peace to man's world, and she is referred to as a \"rookie\" superhero during her first encounter with the League.", "answer_start": 130}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1373", "question": "What else happened in the series?", "answers": [{"text": "(Subsequent episodes touched on her attempts to adjust to her new world).", "answer_start": 415}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1374", "question": "What else was interesting about the comics?", "answers": [{"text": "In an interview segment on the Season One DVD, Bruce Timm stated that he initially ran into some legal issues in using the Wonder Woman character, but was adamant that she be used in the series.", "answer_start": 489}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1375", "question": "What else can you tell me about the origin of the character?", "answers": [{"text": "Additionally, the character of  The Flash  was portrayed as somewhat younger and significantly more brash than his comic book counterpart, taking on a number of personality traits of  Plastic Man, who provides a similar comic relief function in the JLA comics.", "answer_start": 684}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1376", "question": "what else is significant about the comics?", "answers": [{"text": "Major changes were also made to the Hawkgirl character.", "answer_start": 945}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1377", "question": "What else was significant about Hawkgirl's comic book origins?", "answers": [{"text": "The character of Hawkgirl became romantically involved with the John Stewart Green Lantern as the series progressed.", "answer_start": 1001}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1378", "question": "What was the relationship between the two", "answers": [{"text": "A romantic relationship between Batman and Wonder Woman was also \"shown\" (hinted at but never \"official\" unlike Hawkgirl/Green Lantern) by the show's creators, who disliked pairing Wonder Woman with Superman despite fan requests.
