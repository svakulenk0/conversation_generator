{"input_text": "Captain America is seen as the leader of the  Avengers  during the  JLA/Avengers  story. His mind affected by subtle incompatibilities between the two universes, he sees the  Justice League  as overlords who demand praise and worship in return for heroic actions. He especially gets angry at  Superman , who (likewise affected) sees the Avengers as heroes who don't do enough and let their world down. During the first confrontation, Cap and  Batman  battle but reach a standstill, Batman saying it is conceivable Cap could beat him, but asks if he wants to. The two decide to team up to solve the mystery of the game. At the  Bat-Cave  Cap comments on the fact Batman lost  a partner , possibly thinking of  Bucky Barnes . They figure out the plan after Cap gets an inter-dimensional vehicle from the FF that allow them to get to the Grandmaster's headquarters, where they encounter the  Atom , who shows them recordings of the event, revealing the Avengers are fighting for  Krona . Their intervention in the last battle, where Cap makes sure Batman can get the cube so the JLA wins the game by using his shield to get the cube from Quicksilver, causes the villain Krona to go mad and attack the Grandmaster. Cap and Batman together convince the two teams to fight Krona. The Grandmaster then causes the two universes to merge, imprisoning Krona between them. Cap is the only Marvel hero to sense reality changing and his attack on Superman, who also realises the changes, shatters the fixed reality. He commands a group of heroes from both worlds in a wintry Metropolis when they are attacked by a group of villains. He and Superman again argue after he realizes Krona, from the DC Universe is responsible for the chaos, but are stopped by  Wonder Woman . The two teams find the  Grandmaster , who shows them the way their realities are supposed to be. Despite seeing shocking revelations, the two teams decide to face Krona. Cap leads the teams as a battle tactician at Superman's suggestion, communicating orders through the  Martian Manhunter 's telepathy, and gives Superman his shield. Before the battle he and Superman apologize to each other, claiming they each have fears of doing what the other accused them of. During the battle Cap is confronted by  Prometheus  after the Martian Manhunter is brought down by chronal chaos, whom he defeats despite them uploading Batman's skills after he gets his shield back. His ideas ultimately defeat Krona, after  Flash  and  Hawkeye  are nearly killed by  Dreamslayer , he tells them to pretend they are dead and lay low, they stop Krona's plan after he has defeated all the other heroes. Cap is among the core heroes at the end when reality is restored. He and Superman salute each other as they are transported back to their own dimensions, saying they fight on.\nThe importance of the Flash as the \"heart\" of the Justice League was shown in the episode \"A Better World\", when his death in an alternate timeline triggered a series of events which turned that alternate League (the \" Justice Lords \") into virtual dictators of Earth. He has also proven key in saving the day in a few episodes, such as \"Divided We Fall\", in which he defeated the fused  Brainiac / Lex Luthor  when all the other six founding Justice League members could not. In the process, he was drawn into the  Speed Force  (the first explicit use of the concept in the DCAU), and barely managed to escape. The episode \"Flash and Substance\" is centered on the opening of the  Flash Museum  on \"Flash Appreciation Day\" in Central City, and featured many of the Flash's rogues in cameos, while focusing on  Captain Boomerang ,  Mirror Master ,  Captain Cold , and  The Trickster  (voiced by  Mark Hamill ).  Linda Park  also appears as a reporter covering the museum opening. Mirror Master alludes that Wally West may not have been the only Flash stating to the rest of the Rogues, \"We've all been stopped by a Flash.\" Additionally, the episode \"The Great Brain Robbery\", saw the Flash and Lex Luthor inadvertently changing consciousness-Wally West (inside Lex Luthor's body) is tasked with trying to figure out what has occurred, escape, and not be killed by the suspicious members of the Legion of Doom.\nThe Justice League travels to the Marvel Universe and are dismayed (especially  Superman ) by the Avengers' failure to improve their Earth's condition. When the Avengers visit the  DC Universe , they are surprised by the \"futuristic\" architecture of its Earth's cities and the honors that the Justice League and other native heroes receive for their deeds. As a result, they (mainly  Captain America ) become convinced that the Leaguers are fascists who demand that civilians worship them.\nThe Justice League of America always has a version of his first costume present whenever they are inducting new members as a homage to the Crimson Avenger's status as the world's first masked crimefighter (Superman was the first superhero, and the world's first unmasked crimefighter, making his first appearance in June 1938 in Action Comics #1).\nWatching cartoons helps bring your imagination to life and create comedy or hope for mainly children but also adults. An example of a cartoon and comic that does this is The  Justice League  is a fictional superhero group in the  DC Universe  formed to protect Mankind from any threats to their safety. The groups primary members consist of  Batman ,  Superman ,  Green Lantern ,  Wonder Woman ,  Martian Manhunter ,  The Flash , and  Aquaman  but throughout the years the group has expanded its team spreading its belief and movement to heroes around the world to join and fight for what they believe. The Justice League stands for hope for people, and will risk their lives to protect the earth and its inhabitance against all evil, an example of the justice leagues enemies are known as the Injustice league. Many of these heroes have a team that follows their crusade.\nJustice League is an upcoming American  superhero film  based on the  DC Comics   superhero  team  of the same name , distributed by  Warner Bros. Pictures . It is intended to be the fifth installment in the  DC Extended Universe . The film is directed by  Zack Snyder , with a screenplay by  Chris Terrio , and features an  ensemble cast  that includes  Ben Affleck ,  Henry Cavill ,  Gal Gadot ,  Ezra Miller ,  Jason Momoa ,  Ray Fisher , and  Ciar\u00e1n Hinds . In Justice League,  Batman  and  Wonder Woman  assemble a team consisting of  The Flash ,  Aquaman ,  Cyborg  and the newly resurrected  Superman  to face the catastrophic threat of  Steppenwolf  and his army of  Parademon s.\nRalph Dibny was one of the earliest  Silver Age  DC heroes to reveal his secret identity to the public, and also one of the first to marry his love interest. After teaming up with several other superheroes like Batman, Green Lantern, the Atom, Zatanna and the Justice League of America, he became a member of the team. Eventually, his wife became a member as well. The couple was also notable in having a stable, happy, and relatively trouble-free marriage \u2014 an anomaly in the  soap opera tic annals of comic books. Fans of the characters often referred to Ralph and Sue as the \" Nick and Nora Charles  of the super-hero set\" (a reference to  The Thin Man  movies). The very novelty of the Elongated Man stories was that unlike most superheroes, including the Detective Comics Batman, Ralph Dibny solved mysteries, often challenging the reader to do the same. He didn't just use his extraordinary powers or gadgets to chase criminals, but recalled the problem-solving of a genre just that bit older than superheroes: the tale of mystery and detection.\nFeatured Justice League of As were the \"Justice League of Aliens\", led by  Superman  and the  Martian Manhunter ; the \"Justice League of Amazons\", led by  Wonder Woman ; the \"Justice League of Arkham\", led by  Batman ; and the \"Justice League of Atlantis\", led by  Aquaman .Cameo appearances were made by the \"Justice League of Adventure\", led by  the Flash  ( Wally West ); the \"Justice League of Air\", led by  Green Lantern  ( Kyle Rayner ); the \"Justice League of Anarchy\", led by  Plastic Man ; and the \"Justice League of Apostles\", led by the angel  Zauriel .\nVarious Leaguers and Avengers travel across the two universes and fight each other to retrieve the artifacts of power. A final battle for the Cosmic Cube takes place in the Marvel Universe\u2019s  Savage Land . After a climactic, back-and-forth battle, Quicksilver claims the Cosmic Cube. At that moment, Krona and the Grandmaster arrive on the scene, with the latter observing and commenting that the score is even at 6-6. However,  Batman  and Captain America\u2014who together investigated the cause of the contest and discovered its true nature and stakes\u2014arrive. Captain America purposely throws his shield and knocks the Cube from Quicksilver's hands, allowing Batman to catch it. With Captain America's forfeiture of the Cosmic Cube, the Grandmaster now announces the Justice League as the victors, with the final score now being 7-5. However, Krona is unwilling to accept defeat, and attacks the Grandmaster, forcing the identity of Galactus from him. He then summons Galactus and tries to extract information about the origin of the universe. The Grandmaster uses the power of the artifacts and merges both universes together before Krona can tear Galactus apart.\nWhile trying to discover the secret of universal creation, Krona destroys entire universes, eventually arriving in the  Marvel Universe . There he confronts the  Grandmaster , who, in an attempt to save his universe, informs Krona of the existence of a being in the Marvel Universe who has witnessed the Big Bang. In exchange for Krona not destroying this universe, the Grandmaster and he will play a game; two teams, one from each universe, seek out 12 items of great power, six from each universe. Should Krona's team (the  Avengers ) win, Grandmaster will give the knowledge Krona seeks in return for not destroying his universe. But when Grandmaster's team (the  Justice League ) wins\u2014thanks in part to  Batman ,  Captain America  and the  Atom  having discovered the nature of the game in time to ensure that the League win instead of declaring a draw\u2014Krona strikes down the Grandmaster in a rage, draining his knowledge to learn the identity of the being he spoke of, allowing him to summon  Galactus . He then repeats the process with Galactus, but the Grandmaster tricks him and uses the power of the items to lock Krona at the multiversal junction point, having linked the two universes together.\n[[Image:JLA 13 Covers.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Promotional image of the Legion of Doom, from the cover to Justice League of America vol. 2, #13. Art by  Ian Churchill .]] Lex Luthor , and Joker (widely regarded as the archenemies of the JLA's two primary members  Superman  and Batman) recently formed an \"Injustice League Unlimited\", as first seen in the Justice League of America Wedding Special. While it seems the membership is much greater in the promotional image of Justice League of America vol. 2, #13, the core members of the team shown by  Wizard  magazine are a select group of various arch-nemeses.\nWally is a founding member of the Teen Titans,the New Teen Titans,the Titans,Justice League Europe,Justice League Task Force,the \"JLA\" incarnation of the Justice League,and Justice League Elite, among other affiliations.Young Justice\nLego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom is a  direct-to-video   animated  comedy film based on the  Lego  and  DC Comics  brands, which was released on August 25, 2015 on  Blu-ray ,  DVD  and Digital HD. This is the fourth Lego DC Comics film following  Lego Batman: The Movie \u2013 DC Super Heroes Unite ,  Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leaguered  and  Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League . Some actors from various DC properties reprise their respective roles, including  Mark Hamill  as  The Trickster ,  Nolan North  as  Superman ,  Khary Payton  as  Cyborg ,  John DiMaggio  as  The Joker ,  Josh Keaton  as  Green Lantern ,  Kevin Michael Richardson  as  Black Manta ,  Grey Griffin  as  Lois Lane  and  Tom Kenny  as  The Penguin .\n Wally West is the Flash featured as one of the seven founding members of the Justice League, in both the  Justice League  and  Justice League Unlimited  animated series. His personality is more or less the same as it was from his appearance on Superman: The Animated Series, and his flippant attitude is often used to provide comic relief from the often intense nature of his fellow Leaguers, though he is the featured hero in several episodes. However, in one episode of Justice League Unlimited, he complains to  Elongated Man  that he dislikes being viewed as the \"teenage sidekick\" even though he was part of the original seven. His super fast metabolism, which results in him eating absurdly and inhumanly large portions of food, was something of a running gag on the series. Even in the episode \"The Great Brain Robbery\" Lex Luthor after possessing Flash's body defeats Justice League members and before running eats some food. Flash's endorsement of the \"Lightspeed\" candy bar (which created controversy fueled by a  talk-show host who constantly dissed the League  in one episode) was also a sort of running gag, as the bars make numerous other appearances, with Flash's picture on the wrapper in some cases.\nJustice League: Cry for Justice is a seven-issue  comic book   limited series , written by  James Robinson , drawn by Mauro Cascioli, and published by  DC Comics  in 2009. It follows the adventures of a spin-off  Justice League , led by Justice League veterans  Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)  and  Green Arrow , and composed of  Starman (Mikaal Tomas) ,  Congorilla ,  Freddy Freeman , the  Atom (Ray Palmer) , and  Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) . They are seeking a more proactive stand for seeking justice following the apparent deaths of long-standing Justice League members  Batman  and  Martian Manhunter  during the  Final Crisis  event.\nThe team is an assemblage of superheroes who join together as the Justice League. The seven original members were  Batman ,  Aquaman ,  the Flash ,  Green Lantern ,  Martian Manhunter ,  Superman , and  Wonder Woman . The team roster has rotated throughout the years, consisting of many superheroes from the  DC Universe  like  Atom ,  Black Canary ,  Captain Marvel ,  Green Arrow ,  Hawkman , and  Plastic Man .The Justice League received its own comic book title called Justice League of America in November 1960. With the  2011 relaunch  of its titles, DC Comics released a second volume of Justice League. In July 2016, the  DC Rebirth  initiative relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of Justice League. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various television programs and video games and is set to appear in the  live action film of the same name .\nSince then he showed up in various other stories playing games including against  Korvac ,  Kang the Conqueror , and the  Quasar  series. In 2004 the Grandmaster organized the meeting of the  Avengers  and the  Justice League  in an attempt to save the  Marvel Universe  from the  DC Comics  villain  Krona , when Krona came to the Marvel Universe seeking answers about the origin of creation. In an attempt to save his universe, Grandmaster challenged Krona to a game for the identity of a being in the Marvel Universe who had lived through the Big Bang by pitting the Avengers and the JLA against each other in a 'scavenger hunt' for twelve items of power- with Krona choosing the Avengers as his team-, only for Krona to turn on the Grandmaster when he lost due to  Captain America  helping  Batman  gain the  Cosmic Cube . Although Krona's anti-energy powers were able to easily defeat both the Grandmaster and Galactus, the Grandmaster revealed the game was a trick to and was able to use the items gathered to merge the two universes and trap Krona in their 'junction point'. However Krona accelerated the process, with the intention of destroying both universes and learning their secrets. The  Phantom Stranger  guided the two teams to the Grandmaster, who showed them the truth of reality, then died. However the Grandmaster was restored to life when reality was returned to normal, and it was revealed he had been playing a game with the  New God   Metron .\nIn  Justice League: Cry for Justice  mini-series, it has been confirmed that Palmer will become a member of  Hal Jordan 's new  Justice League .\nProject Cadmus (also called  Cadmus Project or simply Cadmus ) was featured as an adversary of the Justice League in the first season (third overall) of animated series Justice League Unlimited. It is described by Emil Hamilton as \"Power brokers, politicians, criminals, and black-ops mercenaries with one thing in common: they're humanity's last hope against (metahumans)\". This version is a combination of the comics version of Cadmus, the Suicide Squad (which appeared in the series as Task Force X, its real name in the comics), and Checkmate. In the series, Cadmus is a government project designed to take precautions against the League going rogue. The project was started when Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid into invading Earth at the end of Superman: The Animated Series where the project (called \"Project: Achilles\") was designed to deal with the Man of Steel if he were to attack the Earth again. It was created by Lex Luthor, and a mutual ally bigoted General Nathaniel Hardcastle who was later killed by Galatea on orders of Cadmus. The project's goals extended to the Justice League as well after the Justice Lords incident. Members of this version of Cadmus include Amanda Waller, Professor Hamilton, Tala, General Wade Eiling, Professor Milo, Maxwell Lord, Hugo Strange, and Doctor Moon. For a short while, they also had turned Captain Atom to their cause. In addition, they also had Task Force X, which is the official name for the organization known in DC Comics as the Suicide Squad, for use in risky field missions. Cadmus was later shown to be backed by Lex Luthor, who only financed the project in a grab for superpowers of his own; a new AMAZO robot with Luthor's conscious mind implanted in it. After taking what he needed to build it from Cadmus and learning the League had figured out his link to the organization, Luthor attempted to destroy the organization by hacking into an immense laser built into the League's Watchtower. Although the building was destroyed, Waller \"had the facility scrubbed as per standard protocol\" after Superman and Huntress broke into to rescue The Question from Moon's captivity. It was then revealed that Brainiac was living inside Luthor at the time, improving upon his physical health and strength while \"subtly influencing (his) actions\". After they were confronted by Batman and then the rest of the founding members of the Justice League, which Waller had released from custody, Luthor and Braniac escaped to Washington, D.C. to a Cadmus building in order to merge with the Dark Heart, a nanotechnology-like alien being which the League defeated thanks to Atom. After both of them were defeated, Cadmus ceased operations against the League and the Justice League announced the establishment of a planetside base to improve their public relations. However, there were a few former members of Cadmus who were still against the Justice League, such as Tala, who ends up joinning Gorrila Grodd's Secret Society and General Eiling. Project Cadmus was responsible for creating the characters Galatea (a clone of Supergirl who resembles Power Girl), Doomsday, the Royal Flush Gang, Volcana, the Ultimen (a team of genetically engineered heroes who are a pastiche of several heroes created for the Super Friends series) and ultimately Terry McGinnis (Batman II). When the Joker took the Royal Flush Gang from Cadmus, he also stole some technology he would later use to overwrite his DNA into Tim Drake during Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker as explained in Epilogue. Elements of the organization were later brought together to initiate 'Project Batman Beyond', to ensure that, in some form or another, there \"would always be a Batman\". Thus Cadmus is responsible for the continuation of the DC Animated Universe storyline into the future.\nAn adaptation of  Justice League Dark  where the titular group will unite to deal with heavenly forces that the Justice League can't handle. The Justice League will also have new members with them.  Matt Ryan , who portrayed  John Constantine  on  NBC 's  Constantine  as well as  The CW 's  Arrow , will return to voice the character. Jason O'Mara will also reprise Batman. Also joining them in the film are  Camilla Luddington  as  Zatanna ,  Nicholas Turturro  as  Deadman , and Ray Chase as  Etrigan the Demon .\nThe Justice League is a fictional group of  superhero es on the  television series ,  Smallville , who were adapted for television by  Alfred Gough  and  Miles Millar . The Justice League originally included Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone, and Arthur Curry; Clark Kent did not accept a role until three seasons later. As the team continued to appear in the series, new characters were introduced and subsequently joined the team. The  original Justice League  first appeared in the  DC comic book   The Brave and the Bold  #28 (1960), and consisted of members  Superman ,  Batman ,  Wonder Woman ,  Flash ,  Green Lantern ,  Aquaman , and the  Martian Manhunter . In Smallville, the team did not make its first official appearance until the  season six  episode \"Justice\", although each member had been previously introduced individually on various episodes since  season four . In the series, the team never formalized a name for themselves, although the cast and crew officially recognized the team as the \"Justice League\".\nThe Elongated Man (Randolph \"Ralph\" Dibny) is a fictional  comic book   superhero  in the  DC   universe . He is a member of three incarnations of the  Justice League . His first appearance was in  The Flash  vol. 1, #112 (May 12, 1960).\nAfter a heated argument with the other members of the Justice League about bringing villains to justice, Green Lantern and Green Arrow quit the Justice League to hunt for villains who were part of the  Secret Society .  Ray Palmer  and  Ryan Choi  team up to beat  Killer Moth  for information about the theft of some of Ray's technology. After being tortured by Palmer, Killer Moth reveals that the person who hired him was  Prometheus .  Starman (Mikaal Tomas)  is distraught over the death of his boyfriend, Tony, who died when a group of villains attacked  S.T.A.R. Labs . In Africa,  Congorilla  mourns the loss of his tribe and the death of  Freedom Beast .\nLego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom  features the Legion of Doom as the main antagonists. This version includes Lex Luthor, Sinestro, Black Manta, Captain Cold, Cheetah, and Gorilla Grodd. Other villains who auditioned to join the Legion of Doom and were rejected for various reasons included Giganta,  Deathstroke , Joker, Penguin, and  Man-Bat . While Luthor is the one that formed them, it is in fact  Darkseid  that ordered him to do so. The Legion of Doom first appears where they attack Area 52 in order to free a capsule containing a specific alien and get away after a fight with the Legion of Doom. Upon releasing the alien, he introduces himself as J'onn J'onzz where he shows off his abilities. Lex Luthor persuades J'onn J'onzz to assist the Legion of Doom against the \"dastardly\" Justice League. With J'onn J'onzz's help, the Legion of Doom fools the Justice League into thinking that the prototype nuketron reactor core is going to explode as part of a plan to discredit them. Cyborg's readings of the core not exploding was repeatedly unheeded. After the Justice League are banished from Earth, the Legion of Doom rejoices as Sinestro is sent to use the Father Box to send the Justice League to the other side of the universe. Upon getting the info needed upon posing as Black Manta, J'onn Jonzz saves Cyborg (who had his dummy take his place in the Justice League's exile) by mind-controlling Sinestro (who was sent to destroy the Hall of Justice) into rescuing the Justice League from the black hole. Lex Luthor pilots the Hall of Doom as Darkseid sends some gifts to the Legion of Doom to help take over Earth. While Cyborg keeps an eye on J'onn J'onzz and Sinestro, the Justice League heads out to fight the Legion of Doom. Using the Hall of Justice's flight mode, Cyborg uses it to fight the Hall of Doom and shoot it down. J'onn J'onzz then helps to defeat the Legion of Doom. Afterwards, the Justice League are cleared of all charges and the Legion of Doom are arrested by the police.\nJustice League United or JLU, is a  fictional   superhero  team that appears in  comic books  published by DC Comics. The team was created by  Jeff Lemire  and  Mike McKone . First appearing in their eponymous series, Justice League United #0 (published in April 2014 and cover-dated June 2014), the team features  Animal Man ,  Equinox ,  Green Arrow ,  Martian Manhunter ,  Stargirl ,  Supergirl ,  Adam Strange  and his partner Alanna Lewis. The team forms in the aftermath of \" Forever Evil \", following the disbandment of the  United States Government -sanctioned  Justice League of America .\nAs a  Justice League  member, Green Arrow will also appear cross over with stories featuring other DC flagship characters from time to time. Of his Justice League colleagues, classic stories depict Ollie as having an ongoing feud with  Hawkman  owing to their differing outlooks on life, and more recently he has been depicted as a good friend of his  Justice League United  colleague  Animal Man . Green Arrow has also been a member of the  Outsiders , both in its incarnation as a covert superhero team led by  Batman  and in its New 52 form as a  secret society  based around various weapon clans, including an Arrow Clan which Oliver is the rightful head of. In the  Golden Age of Comic Books , Green Arrow and Speedy were also affiliated with the superhero group the  Seven Soldiers of Victory .\nIn The Brave and the Bold #28, the Justice League of America faces the threat of  Starro , a giant alien  starfish  with mind-control powers. Snapper Carr, who is spreading  lime  on his family's lawn, is unaffected by Starro when the alien takes mental control of the population of Happy Harbor, Rhode Island. Members of the Justice League realize that Starro can be incapacitated using lime, and the alien is defeated. Comic book historian Ramzi Fawaz has argued that this adventure is a critical one in the development of the modern comic book.  Not only does it mark the beginning of the superhero who identifies as a defender of the world rather than a nation, it marks the first time that a world-destroying (rather than nation-destroying) threat was depicted in comics. Snapper Carr's inclusion was also important. Whereas pre-World War II social norms had emphasized family connections as the most important relationships in a young person's life, the Justice League offered a new kind of relationship, based solely on \"ethical commitments to the world\", which could supplant the family. Snapper also represented a new egalitarian future, one in which youth could be accepted alongside older adults rather than patronized or excluded.  For example, Snapper's first year as an honorary member of the JLA coincided with his senior year of high school. In \"Man, Thy Name is\u2014Brother!\", three League members donate their time to help Snapper write a paper about  brotherhood .\nThe Justice League is the successor to the Golden Age Justice Society of America and make their first official appearance as a group in \"Sidekicks Assemble!\". Includes Aquaman, Batman, Black Canary, Fire, The Flash, Green Arrow, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Martian Manhunter, Red Tornado, Plastic Man, Superman and Wonder Woman. Aqualad, Robin and Speedy are also shown as junior members. In \"Cry Freedom Fighters\",  Plastic Man  mentioned that he was kicked out of the League, but exactly why goes unexplained.\nThe Phantom Stranger is better known for his role as a supernatural assistant to other heroes, such as the  Justice League . His status as either a full, reserve, or honorary member of the League is debatable.  After a vote of the majority of the team in Justice League of America #103, they offered him membership, with Superman declaring the Stranger \"a member\" without qualification, though he left before accepting. This issue was part of an unofficial  metafiction al  crossover  with  Marvel Comics , spanning titles from both of the major comics companies. Beginning in Marvel's  Amazing Adventures  #16 (by  Steve Englehart  with art by  Bob Brown  and  Frank McLaughlin ), the story continued in DC's Justice League of America #103 (by Len Wein,  Dick Dillin  and  Dick Giordano ), and is concluded in  Thor (Marvel Comics)  #207 (by  Gerry Conway  and penciler  John Buscema ). Each comic featured writers Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, and Len Wein, as well as Wein's first wife  Glynis ,  interacting with  Marvel or DC characters at the  Rutland Halloween Parade  in  Rutland, Vermont .  The Phantom Stranger has at least twice asserted his membership status when other Leaguers challenged his input, during the vote on the League's re-admission of  Wonder Woman  and during the crossover with The  Avengers . In contrast, many in-story accounts of League membership fail to include the Stranger; when Zatanna was admitted as a member, Superman and Hawkman clarified that the twelve-member limit in the League's charter had been rewritten previously to admit Hawkgirl as the thirteenth. Writer Len Wein commented on the Phantom Stranger's relationship with the JLA in a 2012 interview stating that the character \"only sort of joined. He was offered membership but vanished, as per usual, without actually accepting the offer. Over the years, other writers have just assumed [he] was a member, but in my world, he never really said yes.\"\nIn Justice League of America, the Martian Manhunter is a member of the US government-sponsored Justice League, taking orders from  Amanda Waller  and  Steve Trevor . Like other members of the team, he has been selected as a counterpart for a member of the independent Justice League, should they ever go rogue; J'onn is Superman's counterpart. He also appears in Justice League; when  Despero  assaults the Watchtower, he is mentioned by  Firestorm  as having been a member of the Justice League when it initially fought with Despero. When Despero incapacitates Firestorm,  Element Woman , and  the Atom , Martian Manhunter appears and defeats him with a telepathic assault. Working with his JLA colleagues in Justice League of America, he investigates the activities of the  Secret Society of Super Villains , led by  the Outsider . Later, the two leagues meet, along with the supernaturally powered  Justice League Dark  in the \" Trinity War \" crossover storyline because of a diplomatic crisis in  Khandaq  triggered by the young superhero  Shazam . The three leagues are gathered together when the Outsider reveals himself to be an evil counterpart of Batman's butler  Alfred Pennyworth , from  Earth-Three , and witnesses the arrival of Earth-Three's evil Justice League's counterparts, the  Crime Syndicate . The three leagues are roundly defeated, and the Martian Manhunter is trapped inside the Firestorm matrix along with his colleagues by Firestorm's evil counterpart Deathstorm. While inside Firestorm, for the duration of the Forever Evil-themed issues of the Justice League of America title, Manhunter and  Stargirl  shared a close adventure interlinked with one another's memories as Despero assisted the Syndicate with keeping the JLA imprisoned. After being freed in Forever Evil #7, the two remain close friends, and along with Green Arrow go on to form the core of a new successor Justice League based out of Canada, in  Justice League United .\nIn the mid-1980s, after his own feature's demise, Aquaman is briefly made the leader of the Justice League of America. In a storyline in Justice League of America #228\u2013230, an invasion of Earth by a race of  Martian s occurs at a time when the core members are missing. Aquaman is thus forced to defend Earth with a League much-depleted in power and capability, and he takes it upon himself to disband the Justice League altogether in Justice League of America Annual #2 (1984), thereafter reforming it with new bylaws requiring members to give full participation to the League's cases. With the help of  Martian Manhunter ,  Zatanna , and  Elongated Man , veteran Justice League members willing to fully commit to the team, Aquaman recruits and trains four new and untried members,  Gypsy ,  Vibe ,  Vixen , and  Steel , also relocating the team's headquarters to a reinforced bunker in  Detroit ,  Michigan  after the destruction of the JLA's satellite headquarters during the invasion. Aquaman's participation in this new version of the Justice League ended in #243 (Oct. 1985), when he resigns to work on his marriage with Mera.\nThe concept of  justice  is a major theme throughout this text. However, the actions of the Justice League in their quest to justify  Sue Dibny's  death are challenged by the seemingly reoccurring theme of  revenge . It can be considered a conflicting matter when determining what is considered justice and what is considered revenge. Justice is more commonly viewed as resolving a matter politically and/or ethically while revenge is seen as imposing suffering on an individual who has made another suffer. The Justice League has the desire for retribution for Sue Dibny's death, however the question lies in the matter of where this desire comes from: personal revenge or unbiased justice. Many factors go into determining what motive the Justice League had in their investigation of Sue's death in terms of revenge and justice. In regards to the characters in the Justice League, the connotation of their title as \"Justice League\" plays a major role in how their actions can be perceived as justifiable. It can be a preconceived misconception to give the Justice League assured justification in any of their actions, seeing as how their title can lead one to believe their actions are based off their \"police\" force resemblance. Therefore their actions in the finding of Sue Dibny's killer can be easily observed as acts of justice and of ethical value. Contrarily, these actions can be viewed as an act of revenge carried out by vigilantes. An aspect of the League's situation that makes it susceptible to be viewed as revenge is that it is a personal matter, seeing as how a member in the league (Ralph Dibny) is personally effected from crime. It can be argued that Ralph Dibny, having gone through the suffering of losing his wife, is seeking revenge and the imposition of suffering for the one(s) who is found guilty for the death of his wife. Both themes hold value to the text and can pertain to the given situation, however it is a matter of an individual's perception of the meaning of both themes in association with the comic's context.\nIn  The New 52  continuity, a new, female Atom is introduced, Rhonda Pineda, a  Hispanic American  college student from Ivy Town. She is revealed to be working as a reluctant spy for  Amanda Waller  and  Steve Trevor , gathering intel on the new Justice League recruits. She is noted to be \"the most important member of the Justice League of America\" by Steve Trevor. At the conclusion of the \" Trinity War \" storyline, she is revealed to in fact be betraying both teams; she hails from the alternate universe of  Earth-3 , where she is a member of the  Crime Syndicate , operating under the name Atomica. She also reveals that by placing a sliver of Green Kryptonite in Superman's optic nerve, she caused him to accidentally kill  Doctor Light , with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time.\nJustice League Task Force was an American monthly  comic book  series published by  DC Comics  from June  1993  to August  1996 ; it lasted 37 issues. At the time the  Justice League  was featured in three separate series:  Justice League America ,  Justice League Europe  (JLE) and  Justice League Quarterly  (JLQ). Justice League Task Force was a spinoff of Justice League Europe, a series which ran from April 1989 to May 1993. Like JLE, this team carried a  United Nations  charter which sanctioned their activities. In fact, JLTF was composed of several former JLE members. The team was called to action by Hannibal Martin, a representative of the  U.N. . He asked that  Martian Manhunter  select a \"strike team\" of fellow Justice League members and to \"lead them on a very special mission\".\nThe Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) is a member of the Justice League in  Justice League Unlimited  and has several short, non-speaking appearances aside from a very minor one in the episode \" This Little Piggy \", where he is voiced by an uncredited  Kevin Conroy  (the voice of  Batman ). He also appeared in the episode \"Patriot Act\" as one of the reinforcements sent to help Green Arrow. For specific information on Crimson's Avenger's appearances on Justice League Unlimited, see  Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) .\nIn  JLA/Avengers , Ray appears first as taking the place of  Wally West  during the Justice League's mission to the  Marvel Universe  when he realizes that there is no  Speed Force  in the other reality. The Justice League arrives and battles a group of monsters while searching for the  Ultimate Nullifier , but Ray stays behind after a brief confrontation with the  Avengers , where he sees them meeting with  Metron  who gives a story different from the one given to the League by  The Grandmaster . Intrigued at this turn of events, Ray jumped on Metron's chair, which took him to the Grandmaster's base. When Batman and  Captain America  arrive, having tracked Metron with the aid of equipment provided by the  Fantastic Four , he shows them that while the Grandmaster is trying to stop  Krona , his team in his game is the League, rather than his own universe's Avengers. When the Grandmaster merges the universes to stop Krona, Ray disappears until the two teams join up to go after Krona himself. Ray participates in the battle and ends up disappearing after Krona's defeat.\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in  World's Finest Comics , starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the  Justice League of America , Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's  Brave and the Bold  #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different  DC Universe  superhero each month.\nThe pilot episode (later re-broadcast as the opening two episodes of season 1) aired a month prior to the debut of the regular series and introduced four characters:  Robin ,  Aqualad ,  Kid Flash , and  Speedy . It established their desire for greater recognition and respect, namely, a promotion from sidekicks to full-fledged superheroes. Met with opposition from their respective mentors in the Justice League,  Batman ,  Aquaman ,  Flash , and  Green Arrow , the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s react in different ways. Speedy resigns from being Green Arrow's partner and begins calling himself Red Arrow. The others seek to persuade their mentors of their worth by secretly taking on a Justice League mission to investigate the  Cadmus  building. During their infiltration of Cadmus' headquarters, the three heroes find a clone of  Superman  named  Superboy . After the discovery, the team finds out Cadmus is creating living weapons called Genomorphs. The episode deals with this revelation, the origin of Superboy, and how this relates to a mysterious group of people called the Light. In the end, Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, and Superboy negotiate with Batman to organize a covert operations team as a practical contrast to the Justice League, whose celebrity status makes it difficult to maintain secrecy or initiate stealth operations. After consulting with his colleagues, Batman establishes Young Justice in a secret cave located inside a former Justice League headquarters,  Mount Justice , a hollowed-out mountain. Here the teens are trained by  Black Canary , given missions by Batman and are watched over by  Red Tornado  until episode twelve when this job is passed over to rotating Justice League members.  Miss Martian  makes an appearance at the end of the episode and joins as the fifth member.\nOn October 27, 2014, Cartoon Network aired the television special  Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leaguered  which details Superman wanting to recruit Batman into the Justice League while he is fighting Penguin and other villains over a gem, but he refuses the league. When Superman mysteriously goes missing, Batman recruits Flash to help find him. With nothing to report, they run into Captain Cold, who is trying to steal an Atlantean pillar in a desert. After a fight which results in the Batwing getting destroyed and Flash mysteriously disappearing, Batman defeats Cold, only for him and the pillar to go missing as well. He goes to Aquaman in the sea, who fights Black Manta for the trident of Poseidon, but he goes through a similar situation, where Aquaman disappears, Batman defeats Manta, and then he and the trident are warped away. Realizing that the Justice League is the target and not the artifacts Batman goes to Wonder Woman and Cyborg, who are fighting Luthor in Metropolis. As Luthor reveals an anonymous buyer wants the daily planet globe, Wonder Woman and Cyborg disappear, leaving Batman to defeat Luthor, only for him and the globe to disappear. Batman realizes that the plot was by  Bat-Mite  and it was to abduct the members of the Justice League and so that Batman can be the number one superhero in the universe.\nMost of the characters retained their general comic book origins and continuity, with  Wonder Woman  being the notable exception. In the Justice League series continuity, the premiere story arc \"Secret Origins\" revises the plot of Diana's competition against her fellow Amazons to be the ambassador of peace to man's world, and she is referred to as a \"rookie\" superhero during her first encounter with the League. (Subsequent episodes touched on her attempts to adjust to her new world). In an interview segment on the Season One DVD, Bruce Timm stated that he initially ran into some legal issues in using the Wonder Woman character, but was adamant that she be used in the series. Additionally, the character of  The Flash  was portrayed as somewhat younger and significantly more brash than his comic book counterpart, taking on a number of personality traits of  Plastic Man , who provides a similar comic relief function in the JLA comics. Major changes were also made to the Hawkgirl character. The character of Hawkgirl became romantically involved with the John Stewart Green Lantern as the series progressed. A romantic relationship between Batman and Wonder Woman was also \"shown\" (hinted at but never \"official\" unlike Hawkgirl/Green Lantern) by the show's creators, who disliked pairing Wonder Woman with Superman despite fan requests.  Robin  is not paired with Batman in this animated series like he was on  Super Friends . Although the series itself is animated in traditional 2-dimensional style, the opening credits are rendered in 3D with  toon shading . The intro is a \"stock\" intro used throughout the series until Justice League Unlimited premieres.\nBatman angers several members, who feel he has no right to remove people already on the team. Captain Boomerang leaves the team for  Amanda Waller 's Suicide Squad, and Nightwing decides to take no part in the Outsiders' questionable activities. Katana is chosen as the team's first official member, joined later by the  Martian Manhunter , Metamorpho and  Grace .  Thunder  is kicked off the team; the second  Aquaman  is rejected because Batman feels he doesn't match up to his predecessor,  Orin . Batman then tells the other members, \"Whether you like it or not, you're here to save the world. And you're going to be hated for it\". After the team's first official mission (in Outsiders #50),  Catwoman  overheard the other recruits talking about the team being \"down by law,\" and said, \"Batman can't possibly start up his own crew of super-crooks without me in it!\"\nThe cancellation of Justice League International led into the launch of a new Justice League of America title (volume 3). The new Justice League of America is entirely separate from the main Justice League as the new team was formed by  Amanda Waller  and consists of  Steve Trevor ,  Martian Manhunter ,  Green Arrow ,  Hawkman ,  Catwoman , the new  Green Lantern   Simon Baz ,  Stargirl ,  Katana  and  Vibe . Katana and Vibe later received their own ongoing titles, although both were cancelled after 10 issues. The new  Atom , Rhonda Pineda, is also a member of the Justice League of America. She works as a spy to gain intel on the Justice League, reporting to Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor. It is later revealed that, unknown to the members of either team, she is actually a member of Earth-3's Crime Syndicate, and is betraying both teams. Each member of the Justice League of America is intended to be a counterpart to the members of the Justice League, in case the Justice League would ever go rogue. Catwoman and Green Arrow both serve as counterparts for Batman.\nFlash  ( Barry Allen ) appeared off and on in the  Super Friends  series throughout its run from 1973 to 1985. He initially appeared in  Super Friends  to help fellow Justice Leaguer, Superman. JLA members Flash,  Green Lantern , and  Batman  eventually joined forces with Superman and the rest of the  Super Friends  in  Challenge of the Super Friends ,  Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show ,  The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians  he was an important member of the superteam.\nIn June 2013, Goyer was hired to write the sequel of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, as well as a new Justice League, with the Beall draft being scrapped.

In Brad Meltzer's Justice League of America (vol. 2) #0 (September 2006), it was revealed that Superman and Batman were again founding members as well.  52  #51 (June 2007) confirmed that the 1989 Secret Origins and JLA: Year One origins were still in continuity at that time, with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman joining the team with founding members' status shortly after the group's formation with Aquaman, Black Canary, Flash, Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter. In Justice League of America #12 (October 2007), the founding members of the Justice League were shown to be Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter.\nAround the time the Steel series was cancelled, Steel was recruited as a member of the Justice League, due to  Batman 's concern that the League was already top-heavy in brawn and required more thinkers. During his time in the League, Steel played a crucial role in the defeat of villains such as  Prometheus  and the  Queen Bee . He even served as the leader of the reserve team\u2014 consisting of  Huntress ,  Barda ,  Plastic Man , and  Zauriel \u2014 left in the present during the  DC One Million  crisis. Following the battle against  Mageddon , he ceased to serve as a full-time member of the League, although he stayed on as a supporting member for quite some time. He also became a regular member in the Superman titles, having relocated with Nat to Metropolis to run his own workshop there, called \"Steelworks.\" He also revealed at this time that he had known Superman's identity for some time. The two became partners of a sort, and John Henry helped Superman build a new  Fortress of Solitude , although he maintained some contacts with the Justice League, as shown when he was able to contact Batman to help Superman find  Lois Lane  after she had been abducted by the  Parasite .\nIn 1999, a futuristic spin-off series titled  Batman Beyond  premiered on The WB, featuring a teenager named  Terry McGinnis  taking on the duties of Batman under the guidance of an elderly Bruce Wayne.
