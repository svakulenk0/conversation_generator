{"input_text": "In recent years, the United States has experienced an increase in the number of cases of throat cancer caused by HPV type 16. Throat cancers associated with HPV have been estimated to have increased from 0.8 cases per 100,000 people in 1988 to 2.6 per 100,000 in 2004. Researchers explain these recent data by an increase in oral sex. Moreover, findings indicate this type of cancer is much more prevalent in men than in women, something that needs to be further explored. Currently, two immunizations, Gardasil and Cervarix, are recommended to girls to prevent HPV-related cervical cancer, but not as a precaution against HPV-related throat cancer.\nBabe Ruth , perhaps the most famous player of all time, also died of throat cancer. In the mid-1940s, Ruth was diagnosed with  nasopharyngeal carcinoma  (cancer of the upper throat). The top two causes of this disease are alcohol and tobacco; Ruth was a heavy user of both.\nThroat cancers are classified according to their  histology  or cell structure, and are commonly referred to by their location in the oral cavity and neck. This is because where the cancer appears in the throat affects the prognosis - some throat cancers are more aggressive than others depending upon their location. The stage at which the cancer is diagnosed is also a critical factor in the prognosis of throat cancer.\nIn August 2006, he announced that he was diagnosed with throat and tongue cancer and completed a seven-week course of radiation and chemotherapy.  He was forced to miss Aerosmith's  Route of All Evil Tour .  David Hull  (who has played in  The Joe Perry Project ) filled in for Hamilton. Hamilton had never previously missed an Aerosmith show. He joined the band for the performance of \"Sweet Emotion\" at their Boston show in September 2006, and at the private show at the  Beacon Theatre  in New York, on December 3, 2006, where he reclaimed his place with the band for the entire performance. On December 20, 2006, Hamilton reported on  Aero Force One  that he is cancer-free after a recent PET scan. He is currently undergoing surgery, the reason being from the radiation he went through due to his throat cancer, so he was not playing some of the  Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour  and again, was replaced by David Hull during that time. Hamilton's cancer returned in 2011, and he has since been treated and is recovering well\nAnother study in  The New England Journal of Medicine  suggests a  correlation  between oral sex and  throat cancer . It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.\nIn early 1989, Vartan was diagnosed with  throat cancer . Even though his cancer made it difficult for him to talk and to be understood at times, he continued with his business expansion and civic leadership. On November 22, 2004, the Management announced that the Vartan family would be taking over the operations of the \"Vartan Group\". Vartan died on December 15, 2004, after his 15-year battle with  throat cancer . He is survived by his wife, Maral, his four children, his three brothers, and his sister.\nThe argument against early diagnosis and treatment is based on the logic that many small thyroid cancers (mostly papillary) will not grow or metastasize. This viewpoint holds the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are  overdiagnosed  (that is, will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the cancer).  Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers.  Thyroid cancer is incredibly common, with  autopsy  studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one third of older adults technically has thyroid cancer, which is causing them no harm.  It is easy to detect nodules that might be cancerous, simply by feeling the throat, which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis. Benign (non-cancerous) nodules frequently co-exist with thyroid cancer; sometimes, it is a benign nodule that is discovered but surgery uncovers an incidental small thyroid cancer. Increasingly, small thyroid nodules are discovered as incidental findings on imaging (CT scan, MRI, ultrasound) performed for another purpose ; very few of these people with accidentally discovered, symptom-free thyroid cancers will ever have any symptoms, and treatment in such patients has the potential to cause harm to them, not to help them.\nIn 1907, Sibelius underwent a serious operation for suspected  throat cancer .Early in 1908, Sibelius had to spend a spell in hospital. His smoking and drinking had now become life-threatening. Although he cancelled concerts in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin, he maintained an engagement in London but there too his Third Symphony failed to attract the critics. In May 1908, Sibelius's health deteriorated further. He travelled with his wife to Berlin to have a tumour removed from his throat. After the operation, he vowed to give up smoking and drinking once and for all. The impact of this brush with death has been said to have inspired works that he composed in the following years, including  Luonnotar  and the  Fourth Symphony .\nThe ash cloud led Argentina to declare a state of emergency for farmers as the prolonged eruption's continued effect on the 2 million head of sheep that graze in southern Argentina.  Chubut  and  R\u00edo Negro Province s had suffered five years of drought, and the ash destroyed the little pastureland still serviceable. 750,000 sheep suffered the consequences, and Rio Negro officials said 60,000 head of cattle also were \"at risk.\"The Livestock had suffered major heart attacks and got throat cancer, which made them die. Whereas there appears to be no published support for the existence of heart attacks or throat cancer as a consequence from the exposure to ashes and causing death, there are at least 2 phenomena which play a role. For one, the physical reduction of available forage (on top of the prevailing general drought conditions) has resulted in lack of forage, and therefore, starvation with all its consequences. This was accelerated by the rapid wear of teeth from the abrasive action of ashes, and thus a reduced efficiency to forage. The second reason is that these ashes cause fluoride intoxication in herbivores, with many different symptoms, and confirmed in sheep, cattle and horses.\nIn 1997, Diamond was diagnosed with  throat cancer . He wrote about his experiences with cancer in his newspaper column, for which he won a prestigious  What The Papers Say  award. In 1999 he was shortlisted for the  Samuel Johnson Prize  for his book C: Because Cowards Get Cancer Too.... A BBC documentary was filmed for Inside Story which followed him through various treatments, and showed his frustration with his speech difficulties following throat, and later tongue, surgery.\nIn November 2010, Douglas's doctors put him on a special weight-gain diet due to excessive weight loss that had left him weak. On January 11, 2011, he said in an interview that the tumor was gone, though the illness and aggressive treatment had caused him to lose thirty-two pounds. He noted that he would require monthly screenings because of a high chance of recurrence within two to three years. In June 2013, Douglas told  The Guardian  that his type of cancer is caused by  HPV , transmitted by  cunnilingus , leading some media to report this as well. His spokesman denied these reports and portrayed Douglas's conversation with The Guardian as general and not referring specifically to his own diagnosis. Although Douglas described the cancer as  throat cancer , it was publicly speculated that he may actually have been diagnosed with  oropharyngeal cancer . In October 2013, Douglas said he had suffered from tongue cancer, not throat cancer. He announced it as throat cancer upon the advice of his physician, who felt it would be unwise to reveal that he had tongue cancer given its negative prognosis and potential for disfigurement, particularly because the announcement came immediately before Douglas's promotional tour for  Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps .\nNinety percent  of cases of  head and neck cancer  (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to squamous cell carcinoma.\nIn April 2009, Marcos Ant\u00f3nio was diagnosed with throat cancer. He had first complained about a sore throat two months earlier, but did not discover the cause until his wife insisted that he visit an  otolaryngologist .\nBloodgood was quick to make use of  X-ray s, discovered in 1895, to investigate bone tumors.He was an early adopter of irradiation as a cancer treatment.He was awarded a gold medal by the  Radiological Society of North America  for his use of X-rays and  radium  to study, diagnose and treat malignant bone tumors.Bloodgood found that \" giant-cell sarcoma \" were bone tissue reactions to irritants rather than malignant growths, and could be cured by  curettage  rather than by amputating the limb.Bloodgood thought that the correlation of mouth and throat cancer with tobacco user could be due at least in part to irritation of the tissues by some substance in the tobacco, which would be aggravated by poor oral hygiene.  He said in 1932 that \"the modern woman who keeps her teeth clean and in good shape teaches men how one should smoke with a minimal risk of cancer.\"\nOropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas  is a type of  head and neck cancer  that begins in the oropharynx, the middle part of the throat that includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, the tonsils, and the side and back wall of the throat. Squamous cell cancers of the tonsils are more strongly associated with  human papillomavirus  infection than are cancers of other regions of the head and neck.\nNinety percent  of cases of  head and neck cancer  (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to squamous cell carcinoma. Symptoms may include a poorly healing  mouth ulcer , a hoarse voice or other persistent problems in the area. Treatment is usually with  surgery  (which may be extensive) and  radiotherapy . Risk factors include  smoking ,  alcohol consumption  and  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . In addition, recent studies show that about 25% of mouth and 35% of throat cancers are associated with HPV. The 5 year disease free survival rate for HPV positive cancer is significantly higher when appropriately treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy as compared to non-HPV positive cancer, substantiated by multiple studies including research conducted by Maura Gillison, et al. of Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center.\nWhen Sherrin became ill with a throat infection in late 2006, later diagnosed as throat cancer,  Peter Curran  stood in as presenter of Loose Ends with  Patrick Kielty  and  Clive Anderson  as guest presenters. Sherrin died of  throat cancer  on 1 October 2007. Clive Anderson became permanent replacement host in 2007.\nChemotherapy  in throat cancer is not generally used to cure the cancer as such. Instead, it is used to provide an inhospitable environment for metastases so that they will not establish in other parts of the body. Typical chemotherapy agents are a combination of  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin .  Cetuximab  is also used in the treatment of throat cancer.\nIn the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the  mouth  and behind the  nose  may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the  lung s and interfering with the person\u2019s ability to  breath e; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to  lung cancer .\nIn 1999, Tanner received a 'Golden Quill Award' for 'Lifetime Achievement in the Arts'. Apart from a prolific career as a cartoonist, Tanner co-wrote several books on black and white art.  He made an animated film called Letter To A Vandal and was an actor and set designer for the New Theatre from 1946 until 1955. As a child he appeared in a number of  films including  comedian   George Wallace 's Gone to the Dogs, Our Gang, an RTA commercial co-starring  Gloria Dawn  and  Forty Thousand Horsemen . In 1986, he worked as a  voice coach  for Sir  Donald Pleasence  for the film  Ground Zero , which starred  Colin Friels . Pleasence's character in the movie was a scientist who had contracted  throat cancer , following  British nuclear tests at Maralinga . Tanner, a throat cancer sufferer, was pleased to help Pleasence learn to operate a Servox speech aid for his role.\nYoung was born on  Christmas Eve  in 1955 in Kissimmee, Florida, the youngest of 7 children he has 3 brothers and 3 sisters his brothers are Theodore (born 1932), Thomas (born 1936), and Travis (born 1939) his sisters are Jennifer (born 1942) Pamela (born 1946) and Flora (born 1951). His father, Trevor Young (February 18, 1901 - January 6, 1958), was a businessman who worked as a car salesman. His mother, Margaret Young (n\u00e9e Martin ; January 2, 1913 - December 27, 2000), was a teacher for the  Florida Board of Education . He was born with  Throat Cancer  and had 36 operations on his throat before he was 3. His father died when he was 2 years old from being murdered. He grew up living with his mother, stepfather and siblings. He attended  Osceola High School  in Kissimmee but later dropped out in his senior year to pursue his acting career. In 1996, he decided to take a break from acting and moved to Florida due to taking care of his dying mother. He married a woman named Sidney in 1978 and has 9 children his children are Robert (born 1980) Stacy (born 1984) Randy (born 1986) Ryan (born 1989) Tessa (born 1993) Rey (born 1996) Ralph (born 1999) Robyn (born 2001) Rex (born 2004). Most recently, he has been the creator writer and executive producer of a  YouTube  show called \"Off2Khali\". As of 2014, Young had retired from acting and is currently living in Florida.In 1982, Young had a recurring role in the  soap opera   Texas  as Mr. Hannibal. He also has starred in TV-movies. He has made guest appearances on TV shows, including  Kung Fu ,  Flamingo Road ,  Knight Rider , and  Murder, She Wrote . He also wrote books such as Workout Economics GCSE in 1987, Transport Economics Digital Textbook, The Economist's Desktop for Windows and Economics A Leven, both released in 1996.\nIn the beginning of 1885 Ramakrishna suffered from clergyman's throat, which gradually developed into  throat cancer . He was moved to  Shyampukur  near Calcutta, where some of the best physicians of the time, including Dr.  Mahendralal Sarkar , were engaged. When his condition aggravated he was relocated to a large garden house at  Cossipore  on 11 December 1885.\nLymph nodes can also swell due to the presence of cancer. For cancers of the head and neck like throat or larynx (voice box) cancer, the lymph nodes of the neck are the first region that it spreads to.Lymphoma, which is a cancer of the immune system, also may lead to lymph node enlargement.ymph nodes can also swell due to the presence of cancer. For cancers of the head and neck like throat or larynx (voice box) cancer, the lymph nodes of the neck are the first region that it spreads to.\nNeck. Growths in the neck can be divided into the following categories: 1) Lymph nodes, 2) Thyroid, 3) Salivary Glands and 4) Other. The other category includes many different benign and malignant solid tumors as well as infectious abscesses which can originate from primary infections of the throat or the teeth.ymph nodes can also swell due to the presence of cancer. For cancers of the head and neck like throat or larynx (voice box) cancer, the lymph nodes of the neck are the first region that it spreads to.\nWhat are lip cancers? Lip cancers are abnormal cells that grow out of control and form lesions or tumors on the lips. They are the most common type of oral cancers. These cancers develop in thin, flat cells \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called squamous cells \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that line the lips, mouth, tongue, cheeks, sinuses, throat, and hard and soft palates. Lip cancer and other kinds of oral cancers are types of head and neck cancers.\nSmoking, including secondhand smoke, is the leading cause of lung cancer. Other cancers. Not only does smoking increase the risk of lung and oral cancer, it also increases the risk of other respiratory system cancers including cancer of the nose, sinuses, voice box, and throat.moking, including secondhand smoke, is the leading cause of lung cancer. Other cancers. Not only does smoking increase the risk of lung and oral cancer, it also increases the risk of other respiratory system cancers including cancer of the nose, sinuses, voice box, and throat.\nThroat or larynx cancer. Throat cancer is cancer of the vocal cords, larynx (voice box), or other areas of the throat. People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Drinking too much alcohol over a long time also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancer. Most throat cancers develop in adults older than 50. Men are more likely than women to develop throat cancer.\nAlso called: Hypopharyngeal cancer, Laryngeal cancer, Laryngopharyngeal cancer, Nasopharyngeal cancer, Oropharyngeal cancer, Pharyngeal cancer. Throat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Throat cancer has different names, depending on which part of the throat is affected.\n1 Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.igns and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat. Check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or throat that doesn't go away. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.\nA virus spread during oral sex is now the main cause of throat cancer in people under 50, scientists have warned. They say the human papilloma virus spread during unprotected sex is to blame for a disturbing rise in potentially deadly oral cancers in the last few decades.\nCancer is a class of diseases in which abnormal cells multiply and divide uncontrollably in the body. These abnormal cells form malignant growths called tumors. Throat cancer refers to cancer of the voice box, the vocal cords, and other parts of the throat, such as the tonsils and oropharynx. Throat cancer is often grouped into two categories: pharyngeal cancer and laryngeal cancer. Pharyngeal cancer forms in the pharynx. This is the hollow tube that runs from behind your nose to the top of your windpipe. Laryngeal cancer forms in the larynx, which is your voice box.\nThis type of throat cancer is the most common in the United States. Adenocarcinoma begins in the glandular cells of the throat. Throat cancer includes several different cancers under the head and neck umbrella. Laryngeal cancer and pharyngeal cancer are two of the most common types of throat cancer. Pharyngeal cancer is broken into three types: Nasopharynx cancer forms in the upper part of the throat. Oropharynx cancer forms in the middle part of the throat. Hypopharynx cancer forms in the bottom part of the throat.\nHead and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer is a group of cancers that starts within the mouth, nose, throat, larynx, sinuses, or salivary glands. Symptoms may include a lump or sore that does not heal, a sore throat that does not go away, trouble swallowing, or a change in the voice.\nThroat Cancer Symptoms. Most often, throat cancer symptoms are mistaken with the symptoms of other diseases. Throat Cancer is also called as Larynx cancer, Vocal cord cancer or Cancer of the glottis. Throat cancer is a specific type of cancer of the vocal cords, voice box (larynx), or other areas of the throat.\nThroat cancer, also known as laryngeal cancer, is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the larynx, leading to the formation of a tumour. Most throat cancers start in the area of the larynx where the vocal cords are located.\nThroat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Throat cancer has different names, depending on what part of the throat is affected. The different parts of the throat are called the oropharynx, the hypopharynx, and the nasopharynx. Sometimes the larynx, or voice box, is also included. The main risk factors for throat cancer are smoking or using smokeless tobacco and use of alcohol. Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.\nTypes of Cancer: Throat Cancer. Throat cancer refers to cancerous tumors that develop in your throat (pharynx) or voice box (larynx). Throat cancer includes cancer of the nasopharynx (the upper part of the throat behind the nose), the oropharynx (the middle part of the pharynx), and the hypopharynx (the bottom part of the pharynx). Cancer of the larynx (voice box) may also be included as a type of throat cancer, and is also called pharyngeal cancer.\nHead and neck cancer is a general term used to refer to a range of different cancers that start developing in the head and neck region of the body. This includes the oral cavity, the tongue, palate, jaw, salivary glands, the throat (larynx) and the nose. Head and neck cancer occurs when malignant tumours grow in any of the tissue or lymph nodes in the head or neck. Not all tumours in the head and neck are malignant.\nTypes of throat cancer. Throat cancer is a general term that applies to cancer that develops in the throat (pharyngeal cancer) or in the voice box (laryngeal cancer). The throat and the voice box are closely connected, with the voice box located just below the throat. Hypopharyngeal cancer (laryngopharyngeal cancer) begins in the hypopharynx (laryngopharynx) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the lower part of your throat, just above your esophagus and windpipe.\nThroat cancer is a general term that usually refers to cancer of the pharynx and/or larynx. Regions included when considering throat cancer include the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, glottis, supraglottis and subglottis; about half of throat cancers develop in the larynx and the other half in the pharynx.\nFor a minority of cases, the virus doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away and can cause serious health problems. These include genital warts and warts in the throat (known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, or RRP). HPV can also cause cervical cancer and other cancers of the genitals, head, neck, and throat. The types of HPV that cause warts are different from the types that cause cancer. As such, having genital warts caused by HPV does not mean that you will develop cancer. Cancers caused by HPV often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show symptoms until the cancer is in later stages of growth.\nThroat cancer refers to cancerous tumors that develop in your throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx) or tonsils. Your throat is a muscular tube that begins behind your nose and ends in your neck. Throat cancer most often begins in the flat cells that line the inside of your throat. Your voice box sits just below your throat and is also susceptible to throat cancer. The voice box is made of cartilage and contains the vocal cords that vibrate to make sound when you talk. Throat cancer can also affect the piece of cartilage (epiglottis) that acts as a lid for your windpipe. Tonsil cancer, another form of throat cancer, affects the tonsils, which are located on the back of the throat.\nWhat is head and neck cancer? The term head and neck cancer refers to a variety of tumors that can occur in the throat, larynx (voice box), nose, sinuses and mouth. Cancer that occurs in the mouth may also be considered to be a type of head and neck cancer. More information on cancers of the mouth, oropharynx and oral cavity can be found in our section on Oral Cancer.\nTypes of throat cancer. Throat cancer is a general term that applies to cancer that develops in the throat (pharyngeal cancer) or in the voice box (laryngeal cancer). The throat and the voice box are closely connected, with the voice box located just below the throat.\nThroat cancer includes several different cancers under the head and neck umbrella. Laryngeal cancer and pharyngeal cancer are two of the most common types of throat cancer. Pharyngeal cancer is broken into three types: Nasopharynx cancer forms in the upper part of the throat.\nLaryngeal cancer and pharyngeal cancer are two of the most common types of throat cancer. Pharyngeal cancer is broken into three types: 1  Nasopharynx cancer forms in the upper part of the throat. 2  Oropharynx cancer forms in the middle part of the throat.  Hypopharynx cancer forms in the bottom part of the throat.\nWhat is throat cancer? Throat cancer is any cancer that forms in the throat. The throat, also called the pharynx, is a 5-inch-long tube that runs from your nose to your neck. The larynx (voice box) and pharynx are the two main places throat cancer forms. Throat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer, which includes cancer of the mouth, tonsils, nose, sinuses, salivary glands and neck lymph nodes.\nThere are two main types of throat cancer: Squamous cell carcinoma develops in the thin, flat cells that line much of the throat. These cells look scale-like when checked under a microscope. This type of throat cancer is the most common in the United States. Adenocarcinoma begins in the glandular cells of the throat. Throat cancer includes several different cancers under the head and neck umbrella. Laryngeal cancer and pharyngeal cancer are two of the most common types of throat cancer. Pharyngeal cancer is broken into three types: 1  Nasopharynx cancer forms in the upper part of the throat.  Oropharynx cancer forms in the middle part of the throat.\nVocal Cord Cancer: What You Need to Know. Symptoms of vocal cord cancer include a sore throat, sensation of something stuck in throat, voice change, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing with associated weight loss, and the appearance of one or more lumps that can be felt in the neck.\nThroat or larynx cancer. Throat cancer is cancer of the vocal cords, larynx (voice box), or other areas of the throat. People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Drinking too much alcohol over a long time also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancer.\nOropharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissue of oropharynx. The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat that includes the base of the tongue, the tonsils, the soft palate, and the walls of the pharynx.ropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas [edit]. Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas is a type of head and neck cancer that begins in the oropharynx, the middle part of the throat that includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, the tonsils, and the side and back wall of the throat.\nThroat cancer stages. Making an educated treatment decision begins with the stage, or progression, of the disease. The stage of throat cancer is one of the most important factors in evaluating treatment options.Our cancer doctors use a variety of diagnostic tests to evaluate throat cancer and develop an individualized treatment plan.he stage of throat cancer is one of the most important factors in evaluating treatment options. Our cancer doctors use a variety of diagnostic tests to evaluate throat cancer and develop an individualized treatment plan.\nIt can be difficult to detect throat cancer in its early stages. Common signs and symptoms of throat cancer include: 1  a change in your voice. 2  trouble swallowing. 3  weight loss. 4  sore throat. 5  persistent cough (may cough up blood). 6  swollen lymph nodes in the neck.hese abnormal cells form malignant growths called tumors. Throat cancer refers to cancer of the voice box, the vocal cords, and other parts of the throat, such as the tonsils and the oropharynx. Raise money to cover your cancer treatment costs.\nWhat Are Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Cancers? Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers start in the lower part of the throat. Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer?\nBut a lump (or lumps) in the neck can be the first sign of cancer of the mouth, throat, voicebox (larynx), thyroid gland, or of certain lymphomas and blood cancers. Such lumps are generally painless and continue to enlarge steadily. Change in the voice. Most cancers in the larynx cause some changes in voice.ut a lump (or lumps) in the neck can be the first sign of cancer of the mouth, throat, voicebox (larynx), thyroid gland, or of certain lymphomas and blood cancers.

Esophageal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the esophagus. The esophagus is the hollow, muscular tube that moves food and liquid from the throat to the stomach.wo types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in flat cells lining the esophagus) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). PubMed Health Glossary.\nThroat or larynx cancer. Throat cancer is cancer of the vocal cords, larynx (voice box), or other areas of the throat. People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Drinking too much alcohol over a long time also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancer. Most throat cancers develop in adults older than 50.\nHead and neck cancer includes cancers of the mouth, nose, sinuses, salivary glands, throat, and lymph nodes in the neck. Most begin in the moist tissues that line the mouth, nose and throat. Using tobacco or alcohol increases your risk.\n1 Some types of HPV may cause genital warts. 2  These are called low-risk types of HPV. 3  Some types of HPV may cause cell changes that sometimes lead to cervical cancer and certain other genital and throat cancers. 4  These are called high-risk types.5  This page discusses these high-risk types.es, high-risk types of genital HPV can cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. The type of cancer HPV causes most often is cervical cancer. Most HPV infections go away by themselves and don't cause cancer. But abnormal cells can develop when high-risk types of HPV don't go away.\nThroat cancer can affect any part of the structures in your throat or mouth. It is a relatively rare form of cancer, but a persistent sore throat can be a sign of the problem. The feeling of a foreign body when you swallow, or lump in the neck or throat, may also be an indication of throat cancer.\nThroat cancer survival rate may differ depending on the stages. Under this cancer, four stages can be classified. Among the most critical stage is the stage 4. Stage 4 throat cancer survival rate is around 30 percent. This is the lowest percentage of survival rate of throat cancer.This stage is widely affecting the lips, the mouth and the lymph nodes. In contrast, stage 3 throat cancer survival rate levels up to 50 to 60 percent.If stages 3 and 4 are low in survival rates, stages 1 and 2 have higher percentages. This implies that you can either have higher or lower survival rate depending on the stage of your cancer.hroat cancer survival rate may differ depending on the stages. Under this cancer, four stages can be classified. Among the most critical stage is the stage 4. Stage 4 throat cancer survival rate is around 30 percent. This is the lowest percentage of survival rate of throat cancer.\nHead and neck cancer includes cancers of the mouth, nose, sinuses, salivary glands, throat, and lymph nodes in the neck. Most begin in the moist tissues that line the mouth, nose and throat. Using tobacco or alcohol increases your risk. In fact, 85 percent of head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco use, including smoking and smokeless tobacco.\n1 Impact on the Heart: Studies have shown that women who drink excessively are at increased risk for damage to the heart muscle than men even for women drinking at lower levels. 13. 2  Cancer: Alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, colon, and breast among women. Cancer: Alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, colon, and breast among women. 2  The risk of breast cancer increases as alcohol use increases. 3  14-17. 4  Sexual Assault: Binge drinking is a risk factor for sexual assault, especially among young women in college settings.\nThe thyroid gland is located at the base of your neck and is responsible for the production of hormones. These hormones regulate the speed at which food is converted into energy within the body.This energy then drives the various processes within the body. This process is known as the metabolism.hese include a sore throat, a lump in your neck, hoarse voice and a difficulty in swallowing. These symptoms can be indicative of other conditions such as throat infections so do not assume that a sore throat or hoarseness means that you have thyroid cancer. You may have a bacterial or. instead.\nThese abnormal cells form malignant growths called tumors. Throat cancer refers to cancer of the voice box, the vocal cords, and other parts of the throat, such as the tonsils and oropharynx. Throat cancer is often grouped into two categories: pharyngeal cancer and laryngeal cancer. Pharyngeal cancer forms in the pharynx.\nThroat Cancer Symptoms and Signs. Throat cancers may not cause any symptoms if they are very small and have not spread at the time of diagnosis. Sometimes, an area of irritation or discoloration on the lining issues of the throat is the only sign of an abnormality.epending upon the extent of spread of the cancer, other symptoms can include swelling of nearby tissues, enlarged lymph nodes, trouble breathing, difficulty speaking, neck or throat pain, ear pain, painful swallowing, and headache.\nRegions included when considering throat cancer include the pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx [cancers that occur in the tissues of the throat adjacent to the larynx], glottis, supraglottis, and subglottis); about half of throat cancers develop in the larynx (the part of the throat with the vocal cords), and the other half in the pharynx.\nOral cancer is a cancer that develops in the tissues of the mouth or throat. It belongs to a larger group of cancers called head and neck cancers. Most develop in the squamous cells found in your mouth, tongue, and lips. Oral cancers are most often discovered after they have spread to the lymph nodes of the neck. Early detection is key to surviving oral cancer.\n1 Oral Cavity Cancer Many people will refer to this kind of cancer a mouth cancer. 2  Oropharyngeal Cancer Oropharyngeal cancer is the name given to cancers which affect the part of the throat called the Oropharynx.\nThroat cancer Throat cancer can cause symptoms including difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and chronic cough. Lymphoma Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system and can cause lymph node swelling, weight loss, fatigue, and more.\nSmoking Causes Mouth and Throat Cancer. Smoking can affect the health of your mouth and throat. As well as the obvious effects such as unsightly stains on your teeth and bad breath, smoking is the major cause of cancers of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, pharynx, larynx (voice box), tongue, lips and salivary glands.1, 2 The longer you smoke, and the more you smoke, the greater the risk of these cancers. 2.s well as the obvious effects such as unsightly stains on your teeth and bad breath, smoking is the major cause of cancers of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, pharynx, larynx (voice box), tongue, lips and salivary glands. 1, 2 The longer you smoke, and the more you smoke, the greater the risk of these cancers. 2.\nThey include cancers of the larynx (voice box), throat, lips, mouth, nose, and salivary glands. Most types of head and neck cancer begin in squamous cells that line the moist surfaces inside the head and neck (for example, the mouth, nose, and throat).o get the right information about treatment and prognosis, you need to know exactly what type of head and neck cancer you have and what stage it is. The Head and Neck Cancers fact sheet has additional basic information. Head and neck cancers are cancers that start in the tissues and organs of the head and neck.\nAt each of our hospitals, you'll find innovative throat cancer treatments and technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094all under one roof.

The throat, also called the pharynx, is a 5-inch-long tube that runs from your nose to your neck. The larynx (voice box) and pharynx are the two main places throat cancer forms. Throat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer, which includes cancer of the mouth, tonsils, nose, sinuses, salivary glands and neck lymph nodes. Learn about the types of throat cancer.\nThroat cancer refers to cancerous tumors that develop in your throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx) or tonsils. Your throat is a muscular tube that begins behind your nose and ends in your neck. Throat cancer most often begins in the flat cells that line the inside of your throat. Your voice box sits just below your throat and is also susceptible to throat cancer. The voice box is made of cartilage and contains the vocal cords that vibrate to make sound when you talk. Throat cancer can also affect the piece of cartilage (epiglottis) that acts as a lid for your windpipe.\nThroat cancer refers to cancer of the voice box, the vocal cords, and other parts of the throat, such as the tonsils and oropharynx. Throat cancer is often grouped into two categories: pharyngeal cancer and laryngeal cancer. Pharyngeal cancer forms in the pharynx. This is the hollow tube that runs from behind your nose to the top of your windpipe. Laryngeal cancer forms in the larynx, which is your voice box. Throat cancer is relatively uncommon when compared to other cancers.\nErbitux is also used to treat \u00e2\u0080\u0098squamous cell\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cancers of the head and neck. These types of cancer affect the cells of the lining of the mouth or the throat, or of organs such as the larynx (voice box).\nHead and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer is a group of cancers that starts within the mouth, nose, throat, larynx, sinuses, or salivary glands.[1] Symptoms may include a lump or sore that does not heal, a sore throat that does not go away, trouble swallowing, or a change in the voice.\nPrognosis of Throat cancer (Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Tonsil) How is Throat cancer (Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Tonsil) Treated? What is Throat cancer (Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Tonsil) Throat cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil is a part of cancers of the head and neck. In oncology squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are often considered together because they share many similarities - in incidence, cancer type, predisposing factors, pathological features, treatment of the cancer and cancer prognosis.\nOropharyngeal cancers (cancers of the middle part of the throat, including the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils): About 70% of oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV. In the United States, more than half of cancers diagnosed in the oropharynx are linked to HPV type 16 . Rarer cancers: HPV causes about 65% of vaginal cancers, 50% of vulvar cancers, and 35% of penile cancers . Most of these are caused by HPV type 16. High-risk HPV types cause approximately 5% of all cancers worldwide .\nThey are linked to some cancers of the mouth and throat, too. Again, although HPVs have been linked to these cancers, most people infected with HPV never develop these cancers. Smoking, which is also linked with these cancers, may work with HPV to increase cancer risk.Other genital infections may also increase the risk that HPV will cause cancer.hey are linked to some cancers of the mouth and throat, too. Again, although HPVs have been linked to these cancers, most people infected with HPV never develop these cancers. Smoking, which is also linked with these cancers, may work with HPV to increase cancer risk.\n1 Some types of HPV may cause genital warts. 2  These are called low-risk types of HPV. 3  Some types of HPV may cause cell changes that sometimes lead to cervical cancer and certain other genital and throat cancers. 4  These are called high-risk types.5  This page discusses these high-risk types.es, high-risk types of genital HPV can cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. The type of cancer HPV causes most often is cervical cancer. Most HPV infections go away by themselves and don't cause cancer.\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that 36,000 people will be diagnosed with oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer this year, and these cancers will cause 6,850 deaths. Oral cancer can affect any of the working parts of your mouth or oral cavity, which includes:1  your lips. 2  the tissue that lines your lips and cheeks. 3  your teeth. 4  two-thirds of your tongue (the back third of your tongue, or base, is considered part of your oropharynx, or throat). 5  your gums.he American Cancer Society estimates that 36,000 people will be diagnosed with oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer this year, and these cancers will cause 6,850 deaths. Oral cancer can affect any of the working parts of your mouth or oral cavity, which includes: 1  your lips.\nSometimes soreness or irritation at the back of the tongue can also register as throat pain. The types of disorders that can cause throat pain include pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and, in rare cases, throat cancer. Inflammation of the throat is commonly caused by viral or bacterial infections. A common bacterial infection of the throat is due to Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus, known as strep throat. Infectious mononucleosis is a type of viral infection that produces characteristic throat pain.\nTypes of throat cancer. Throat cancer is a general term that applies to cancer that develops in the throat (pharyngeal cancer) or in the voice box (laryngeal cancer). The throat and the voice box are closely connected, with the voice box located just below the throat. Though most throat cancers involve the same types of cells, specific terms are used to differentiate the part of the throat where cancer originated. 1  Nasopharyngeal cancer begins in the nasopharynx \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the part of your throat just behind your nose.\n1 Symptoms of throat cancer. 2  Throat cancer can spread. 3  Risk factors of throat cancer.

Things to remember.\nThere are several possible connections between neck pain and cancer. The illness could manifest itself as a tumor in the neck area, or as metastatic cancer, which is cancer that spreads from another part of the body. Squamous, thyroid, and spinal cancer or leukemia can all be indicated by neck pain. It is possible that neck pain is caused by cancer if it is constant, keeps getting worse, and is not responsive to medication. There may also be a painful lump in the neck, accompanied by a constant sore throat. In order to diagnose a definitive link between neck pain and cancer, a doctor will perform several tests.", "key": "31_1", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:58.943516", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
