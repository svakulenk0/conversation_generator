{"input_text": "Decades of research has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the  lung ,  larynx , head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney,  esophagus  and  pancreas . Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including  nitrosamine s and  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon s. Tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world, and about one in five worldwide.  Lung cancer  death rates in the United States have mirrored  smoking  patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990. However, the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising, leading to what some organizations have described as the tobacco epidemic.\nThe Lung Cancer Treatment Center at Saint Agnes is a  lung cancer screening  site for the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP).\nAsbestos  can cause a variety of lung diseases, including lung cancer.  Tobacco  smoking and asbestos have a  synergistic  effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the  pleura , called  mesothelioma  (which is different from lung cancer).\nThe International Early Lung Cancer Action Project (I-ELCAP) published the results of CT screening on over 31,000 high-risk patients in late 2006 in the  New England Journal of Medicine . In this study, 85% of the 484 detected lung cancers were stage I and thus highly treatable. Historically, such stage I patients would have an expected 10-year survival of 88%. Critics of the I-ELCAP study point out that there was no randomization of patients (all received CT scans and there was no comparison group receiving only chest x-rays) and the patients were not actually followed out to 10 years post detection (the median followup was 40 months). Regardless of these shortcomings, it is generally recognized that the prognosis of lung cancer decreases dramatically when the disease is in late stage, and that CT screening for lung cancer allows detection of lung cancer during its earliest, most curable stage. CT screening for lung cancer has already been extensively compared to chest x-ray screening in Japan.  Among over 6,800 subjects screened in Japan, 67% to 73% of CT-detected lung cancers were missed by chest x-ray, the same test used in the comparison group of some randomized controlled trials of lung cancer screening.\nCancers in the pancreas may also be  secondary cancer s that have spread from other parts of the body.  This is uncommon, found in only about 2% of cases of pancreatic cancer.  Kidney cancer  is by far the most common cancer to spread to the pancreas, followed by  colorectal cancer , and then cancers of the  skin ,  breast , and  lung .  Surgery may be performed on the pancreas in such cases, whether in hope of a cure or to alleviate symptoms.\nDied of  lung cancer .\nSmoking , particularly of  cigarette s, is by far the main contributor to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known  carcinogen s, including  benzo[a]pyrene ,  NNK ,  1,3-butadiene  and a  radioactive isotope  of polonium,  polonium-210 . Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women). Smoking accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases.\nMalignant pleural effusion is a condition in which  cancer  causes an abnormal amount of fluid to collect between the thin layers of tissue ( pleura ) lining the outside of the lung and the wall of the  chest cavity .  Lung cancer  and  breast cancer  account for about 50-65% of malignant pleural effusions.  Other common causes include  pleural mesothelioma  and  lymphoma .\nLung cancer surgery describes the use of  surgical operations  in the  treatment  of  lung cancer . It involves the surgical excision of cancer tissue from the lung. It is used mainly in  non-small cell lung cancer  with the intention of curing the patient.\nSmoking has profound effects on the human body in many ways and contributes to the United States leading cause of death, heart disease. According to the National Cancer Institute, there are more than 440,000 early deaths each year in America due to smoking. The primary organ that is closely related to smoking are the lungs. There are two types of lung cancer, the first type is called Small Cell Lung Cancer and is accountable for 20% of all lung cancers. The cancer cells in these patients are typically smaller than regular cancer cells, but they multiply rapidly to generate massive tumors. The second type is called Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and is responsible for 80% of call cancer cases. Cancers such as the Squamous cell carcinoma in men and Adenocarcinoma in women are the two most common form of NSCLC.\nMcCarthy announced on June 3, 2013, that she has a treatable form of  lung cancer . On November 8, 2013, it was reported that McCarthy, who had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, was suing more than 70 companies claiming that she had developed lung cancer from  asbestos . Her father and brother, whose clothes she washed, worked with asbestos. This was challenged by  New York Times  columnist  Joe Nocera , who claimed McCarthy was part of a growing trend of cigarette smokers suing companies that once used asbestos, citing her nearly lifelong \"pack-a-day\" habit as evidence that she was knowingly bringing a bogus case and partaking in a widespread \"asbestos scam.\"\nLung cancers are now considered a large and extremely  heterogeneous  family of  neoplasms  that feature widely varying  gene tic,  biological , and  clinical  characteristics. About 50 different lung cancer variants are recognized under the 2004 revision of the  World Health Organization  (\"WHO-2004\")  histological  typing system, the most widely recognized and used lung cancer classification scheme. Recent studies have shown beyond doubt that the old classification paradigm of \"small cell carcinoma vs. non-small cell carcinoma\" is now obsolete, and that the correct \"subclassification\" of lung cancer cases is necessary to assure that patients receive optimum  management .\nIt is impossible to determine the initial cause for most specific cancers.  In a few cases, only one cause exists; for example, the virus  HHV-8  causes all  Kaposi's sarcoma s.  However, with the help of  cancer epidemiology  techniques and information, it is possible to produce an estimate of a likely cause in many more situations.  For example,  lung cancer  has several causes, including tobacco use and  radon gas .  Men who currently smoke tobacco develop lung cancer at a rate 14 times that of men who have never smoked tobacco, so the chance of lung cancer in a current smoker being caused by smoking is about 93%; there is a 7% chance that the smoker's lung cancer was caused by radon gas or some other, non-tobacco cause.  These statistical correlations have made it possible for researchers to infer that certain substances or behaviors are carcinogenic. Tobacco smoke causes increased  exogenous  DNA damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. Among the more than 5,000 compounds in tobacco smoke, the  genotoxic  DNA damaging agents that occur both at the highest concentrations and which have the strongest mutagenic effects are acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide and isoprene.\nLung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant  lung tumor  characterized by uncontrolled  cell growth  in  tissues  of the  lung . If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of  metastasis  into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most  cancer s that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are  carcinomas . The two main types are  small-cell lung carcinoma  (SCLC) and  non-small-cell lung carcinoma  (NSCLC). The most common  symptom s are coughing (including  coughing up blood ), weight loss, shortness of breath, and  chest pain s.\nScientific explanations increasingly pose not  determinism 's universal laws, but  probabilism 's chance,  ceteris paribus  laws.  Smoking's contribution to  lung cancer  fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%).  (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).)  An  applied science  that applies  statistics  seeking associations between events,  epidemiology  cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest.  Versus nonsmokers, however, smokers as a group showed over 20 times the risk of lung cancer, and in conjunction with  basic research , consensus followed that smoking had been scientifically explained as a cause of lung cancer, responsible for some cases that without smoking would not have occurred, a probabilistic  counterfactual  causality.\nWomen and men have approximately equal risk of dying from  cancer , which accounts for about a quarter of all deaths, and is the second leading cause of death. However the relative incidence of different cancers varies between women and men. In the United States the three commonest types of cancer of women in 2012 were  lung ,  breast  and  colorectal  cancers.  In addition other important cancers in women, in order of importance, are  ovarian ,  uterine  (including  endometrial  and  cervical  cancers (Gronowski and Schindler, Table III). Similar figures were reported in 2016. While cancer death rates rose rapidly during the twentieth century, the increase was less and later in women due to differences in  smoking  rates. More recently cancer death rates have started to decline as the use of tobacco becomes less common. Between 1991 and 2012, the death rate in women declined by 19% (less than in men). In the early twentieth century death from uterine ( uterine body  and  cervix ) cancers was the leading cause of cancer death in women, who had a higher cancer mortality than men. From the 1930s onwards, uterine cancer deaths declined, primarily due to lower death rates from cervical cancer following the availability of the  Papanicolaou  (Pap) screening test. This resulted in an overall reduction of cancer deaths in women between the 1940s and 1970s, when rising rates of lung cancer led to an overall increase. By the 1950s the decline in uterine cancer left breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death till it was overtaken by lung cancer in the 1980s. All three cancers (lung, breast, uterus) are now declining in cancer death rates (Siegel et al. Figure 8), but more women die from lung cancer every year than from breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers combined. Overall about 20% of people found to have lung cancer are never smokers, yet amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing lung cancer is three times greater than amongst men who never smoked.\nAbout 8% of lung cancer is due to  inherited  factors. In relatives of people with lung cancer, the risk is doubled. This is likely due to a  combination of genes .  Polymorphisms  on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk of lung cancer.\nCIP2A is over-expressed in several common human malignancies including, human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ),  colon cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. Notably, in these cancer types CIP2A over-expression is observed with very high frequency;  in breast cancer around 40% of cancer patients are over-expressing CIP2A whereas in all other studied cancer types the frequency is between 65-87 percent. In breast cancer CIP2A expression correlates with disease aggressivity whereas in gastric and lung cancer CIP2A expression predicts for poor patient survival. To date high CIP2A expression has been observed to predict poor patient prognosis in more than dozen human cancer types, which makes it one of the most frequently altered human oncoprotein with clinical relevance.\nDocetaxel is used in the treatment of a variety of cancers including: breast, lung, prostate, gastric, head and neck, and ovarian cancer. Clinical data has shown docetaxel to have cytotoxic activity against breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, prostate, liver, renal, gastric, head and neck cancers, and melanoma. In hormone refractory prostate cancer docetaxel improves life expectancy and overall life quality.\nLung cancer  is an extremely  heterogeneous  family of malignant  neoplasm s, with well over 50 different  histological  variants recognized under the 4th revision of the  World Health Organization  (WHO) typing system (\"WHO-2004\"), currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme. Because these variants have differing genetic, biological, and clinical properties, including response to treatment, correct classification of lung cancer cases are necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management.\nColorectal cancer  is the second leading cause of  cancer  death in the United States (after  lung cancer ), and the third most common cancer overall in men (after  prostate  and lung cancer) and women (after  breast  and lung cancer). Once identified, the treatment approach for rectal cancer is dictated by the stage of the tumor ( T-stage ) and  local lymph nodes  (N-stage). There are currently no imaging methods that provide reliable N-staging accuracy of colorectal cancers. While  endorectal ultrasound  (EUS) is the standard for staging the degree of wall invasion of rectal cancers (T-stage), its accuracy is poor in the critical determination between uT2 and uT3, with 10-35% of uT2 tumors being overstaged. The consequences for the patient are dramatic. A stage uT3 rectal carcinoma is treated by radical surgical resection, and is typically treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Neoadjuvant treatment damages adjacent healthy tissues, and can impair the healing process following surgery, leading to increased complications of infection, bleeding, decreased colonic mobility, and incontinence. Whereas stage uT2, N- and lower tumors generally receive a transanal local excision and are not treated neoadjuvantly, eliminating these additional risks to the patient.\nAbout 1% of lung cancers are  sarcoma s,  germ cell tumor s, and  hematopoietic tumors , while 99% of lung cancers are  carcinoma . Carcinomas are tumors composed of transformed, abnormal cells with  epithelial   tissue  architecture and/or  molecular  characteristics, and which derive from  embryo nic  endoderm . 8 major taxa of lung carcinomas are recognized within the WHO-2004 classification:\nLung cancer is responsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually, and is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and the second most common in women. The most common cause of lung cancer is long-term exposure to  tobacco smoke . Lung cancer in non-smokers, who account for approximately 15% of cases, is often attributed to a combination of  genetic factors ,  radon  gas,  asbestos , and  air pollution . The main types of lung cancer are  non-small cell lung carcinoma  and  small cell lung carcinoma , the two being distinguished  histologically  as well as by how they are treated; non-small cell lung carcinoma is primarily treated with  surgery  if feasible, while small cell lung carcinoma is more frequently treated with  chemotherapy  and  radiation .\nSome evidence links HPV to benign and malignant tumors of the upper respiratory tract. The International Agency for Research on Cancer  has found that people with lung cancer were significantly more likely to have several high-risk forms of HPV antibodies compared to those who did not have lung cancer. Researchers looking for HPV among 1,633 lung cancer patients and 2,729 people without the lung disease found that people with lung cancer had more types of HPV than noncancer patients did, and among lung cancer patients, the chances of having eight types of serious HPV were significantly increased. In addition, expression of HPV structural proteins by immunohistochemistry and in vitro studies suggest HPV presence in bronchial cancer and its precursor lesions. Another study detected HPV in the EBC, bronchial brushing and neoplastic lung tissue of cases, and found a presence of an HPV infection in 16.4% of the subjects affected by nonsmall cell lung cancer, but in none of the controls. The reported average frequencies of HPV in lung cancers were 17% and 15% in Europe and the Americas, respectively, and the mean number of HPV in Asian lung cancer samples was 35.7%, with a considerable heterogeneity between certain countries and regions.\nIn addition, since many cancers spread via the bloodstream and the entire cardiac output passes through the lungs, it is common for cancer  metastases  to occur within the lung.  Breast cancer  may invade directly through local spread, and through lymph node metastases. After metastasis to the  liver ,  colon cancer  frequently metastasizes to the lung.  Prostate cancer , germ cell cancer and  renal cell carcinoma  may also metastasize to the lung.\nAn explosion of new knowledge, accumulated mainly over the last 20 years, has proved that lung cancers should be considered an extremely  heterogeneous  family of  neoplasms  with widely varying genetic, biological, and clinical characteristics, particularly their responsiveness to the large number of newer treatment protocols. Well over 50 different histological variants are now recognized under the 2004 revision of the  World Health Organization  (\"WHO-2004\") typing system, currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme. Recent studies have shown beyond doubt that the old clinical classification paradigm of \"SCLC vs. NSCLC\" is now obsolete, and that correct \"subclassification\" of lung cancer cases is necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management.\nThe Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute (ALCMI voiced as Alchemy) is a patient-founded non-profit research consortium established to help make  lung cancer  a survivable disease.  Founded by advanced stage lung cancer patient Bonnie J. Addario, founder of the  Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation , .\nThe Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation is a registered charity in the  United Kingdom  which aims to provide help and hope to people affected by lung cancer. Founded in  Liverpool  in 1990, it is the only UK charity to focus solely on lung cancer care. The charity has a dual focus - saving lives and supporting people affected by lung cancer. It funds lung cancer research, supports the prevention of lung cancer by encouraging and helping people to avoid or quit smoking, and raises general awareness of lung cancer and its symptoms. It also supports lung cancer patients by running support groups, providing information to the  NHS , and other measures.\nTreatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has  spread , and the person's  performance status . Common treatments include  palliative care ,  surgery ,  chemotherapy , and  radiation therapy .  Targeted therapy of lung cancer  is growing in importance for advanced lung cancer.\nSmoking most commonly leads to diseases affecting the heart and  lungs  and will most commonly affect areas such as hands or feet with first signs of smoking related health issues showing up as numbness, with smoking being a major risk factor for  heart attacks ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD),  emphysema , and  cancer , particularly  lung cancer , cancers of the  larynx  and  mouth , and  pancreatic cancer . Overall life expectancy is also reduced in long term smokers, with estimates ranging from 10 to 17.9. years fewer than nonsmokers. About one half of long term male smokers will die of illness due to smoking. The association of smoking with lung cancer is strongest, both in the public perception and etiologically. Among male smokers, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 17.2%; among female smokers, the risk is 11.6%. This risk is significantly lower in nonsmokers: 1.3% in men and 1.4% in women. Historically, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease prior to  World War I  and was perceived as something most physicians would never see during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking came a virtual epidemic of lung cancer.\nFollowing the National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening Trial, guidelines were released initially in 2012 by the  National Comprehensive Cancer Network , an alliance of twenty one cancer centers in the United States.  Their consensus guidelines, which are regularly updated, support screening as a process, not a single test, and discuss risks and benefits of screening in high risk individuals within a comprehensive multidisciplinary program.  Screening is only recommended for individuals defined as high risk meeting specific criteria.  More details can be found in their patient guidelines. While lung cancer screening programs have been supported by the  NCCN, International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American Cancer Society, The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and other organizations, the costs of screening may not be covered by medical insurance policies.\nLung cancer  is the most common cancer in the world, both in terms of cases (1.6 million cases; 12.7% of total cancer cases) and deaths (1.4 million deaths; 18.2% of total cancer deaths).  Lung cancer is largely caused by tobacco smoke.  Risk estimates for lung cancer in the United States indicate that tobacco smoke is responsible for 90% of lung cancers.  Other factors are implicated in lung cancer, and these factors can interact synergistically with smoking so that total attributable risk adds up to more than 100%.  These factors include occupational exposure to carcinogens (about 9-15%), radon (10%) and outdoor air pollution (1-2%).  Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of more than 5,300 identified chemicals.  The most important carcinogens in tobacco smoke have been determined by a \u201cMargin of Exposure\u201d approach.  Using this approach, the most important tumorigenic compounds in tobacco smoke were, in order of importance, acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide, and isoprene.  Most of these compounds cause DNA damage by forming DNA adducts or by inducing other alterations in DNA.  DNA damages are subject to error-prone DNA repair or can cause replication errors.  Such errors in repair or replication can result in mutations in tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes leading to cancer.\nIn the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the  mouth  and behind the  nose  may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the  lung s and interfering with the person\u2019s ability to  breath e; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to  lung cancer .\nTwenty-two DNA repair genes with hypermethylated promoters, and reduced or absent expression, were found to occur among 17 types of cancer, as listed in two review articles.  As listed in one of the reviews, promoter hypermethylation of  MGMT  occurs frequently in a number of cancers including 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers.  That review also indicated promoter hypermethylation of  LIG4 ,  NEIL1 ,  ATM ,  MLH1  or  FANCB  occurs at frequencies between 33% to 82% in one or more of  head and neck cancer s,  non-small-cell lung cancer s or  non-small-cell lung cancer  squamous cell carcinomas.  The article  Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase  indicates the DNA repair gene  WRN  has a promoter that is frequently hypermethylated in a number of cancers, with hypermethylation occurring in 11% to 38% of  colorectal ,  head and neck ,  stomach ,  prostate ,  breast ,  thyroid ,  non-Hodgkin lymphoma ,  chondrosarcoma  and  osteosarcoma  cancers (see  WRN ).\nLung cancer is one of the most lethal and common forms of cancer worldwide. Pollution, smoking (active and  passive ),  radiation  (in the form of x-rays or gamma rays) and  asbestos  are risk factors for lung cancer. Symptoms may include persistent cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, fatigue, and swelling of the neck and face. There are different types of lung cancers, which can  metastasize . Treatments include  chemotherapy , surgery, and  radiation . The treatment aimed at killing the cancer can also eliminate functioning lung cells (leukocytes).Specific genetic factors can add to the risk of developing lung cancer. There are regions on chromosomes which are highly susceptible to mutation and, if present, increase the risk of developing lung cancer. These loci are the specific locations of a gene or a DNA sequence on a chromosome. Several loci are associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer.Approximately 26 different genes can mutate into one type of lung cancer, known as carcinoma. An example is the MAP pathway, which is inhibited by ME (a lung cancer treatment). The risk of developing lung cancer is higher for those with a family history of the disease. A second way the risk could go up is if the individual lives with a smoker.\nSalivary gland\u2013like carcinomas of the lung generally refers a class of rare  cancer s that arise from the uncontrolled cell division ( mitosis ) of  mutated   cancer stem cell s in  lung tissue . They take their name partly from the appearance of their abnormal  cells , whose structure and features closely resemble those of  cancers  that form in the major  salivary gland s ( parotid gland s,  submandibular gland s and  sublingual gland s) of the head and neck.  Carcinoma  is a term for malignant  neoplasms  derived from cells of  epithelial  lineage, and/or that exhibit cytological or tissue architectural features characteristically found in epithelial cells.<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |vauthors=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191\u2013202 |date=January 1995 |pmid=8000996 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+\nIn addition to the AIDS-defining tumors listed above, HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of certain other tumors, notably  Hodgkin's disease ,  anal  and  rectal carcinoma s,  hepatocellular carcinoma s,  head and neck cancer s, and lung cancer. Some of these are causes by viruses, such as Hodgkin's disease (EBV), anal/rectal cancers (HPV), head and neck cancers (HPV), and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hepatitis B  or  C ). Other contributing factors include exposure to carcinogens (cigarette smoke for lung cancer), or living for years with subtle immune defects.\nBoffetta's specific field of research is the study of environmental factors for  cancer . He always was very much interested in international collaboration why he was founding member and member of the executive committee of the several international research consortia, e.g. Interlymph \u2013  Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma  consortium (2001\u201308), the ILCCO \u2013  Lung cancer  consortium (2003-), the INHANCE \u2013  Head and neck cancer  consortium (2004-), the PANC4 \u2013  Pancreatic cancer  consortium and the ESC3 \u2013  Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  consortium.Currently Boffetta is involved in several  case-control studies  of molecular epidemiology in different organs and countries around the world (among are: lung, head and neck, kidney and pancreatic cancer in Poland, Russia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the UK; head and neck cancer in Brazil, Argentina and Cuba; lymphoma in France, Spain, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Czech Republic).  Cohort studies  with his participation are running in Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Finland and Israel for lung cancer risk among asphalt workers; and in Iran for esophageal cancer. Other studies where he is the principal investigator are the retrospective mortality study and cohort study of alcohol-associated cancers in Western Siberia, Russia; the Case-only and case-control study of  hepatocellular carcinoma  within the International Liver Cancer Study (3 centers in Thailand, Egypt and Italy); or the Case-control study of esophageal cancer in high-risk populations (2 centers in Iran and India).\nClinical Lung Cancer publishes articles on detection, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of lung cancer. The emphasis is on recent scientific developments in all areas related to lung cancer.\nDeaths in either group were then logged for up to five years. As of October 2010, 354 people in the CT scan group had died from lung cancer, versus 442 people in the X-ray group; in other words, deaths in the CT scan group of patients were 20.3% lower than in the X-ray group. The study's review board concluded that this difference was  statistically significant  and recommended terminating the study. The director of the National Cancer Institute's director, Harold Varmus, said that early analysis results appeared to indicate that CT scans detected more lung cancers, at an earlier and more treatable stage, and that CT scans could therefore somewhat reduce the number of deaths in patients at high risk of lung cancer. Researchers associated with the study cautioned that the preliminary results did not constitute sufficient grounds to make the general public undergo CT scans and that further research and analysis of the data was necessary. The benefits of screening would have to be balanced against the risks associated with  false positive s \u2013 suspicious CT scan findings that in the end prove not to be cancer-related (although if the randomized data holds this demonstrates the benefits of screening outweigh the negatives of false positives on mortality) \u2013 and there is as yet no data showing how CT scan screening would benefit other sections of the population, such as people who had only smoked for shorter periods of time.\nThere are typically three objectives applied to the treatment of lung cancer and can vary by patient or individual diagnosis: (1) curing lung cancer, (2) controlling lung cancer, and (3) being comfortable.\nAsbestos can cause  lung cancer  that is identical to lung cancer from other causes. Exposure to asbestos is associated with all major histological types of lung carcinoma  ( adenocarcinoma ,  squamous cell carcinoma ,  large-cell carcinoma  and  small-cell carcinoma ). The latency period between exposure and development of lung cancer is 20 to 30 years. It is estimated that 3%-8% of all lung cancers are related to asbestos. The risk of developing lung cancer depends on the level, duration, and frequency of asbestos exposure (cumulative exposure). Smoking and individual susceptibility are other contributing factors towards lung cancer. Smokers who have been exposed to asbestos are at far greater risk of lung cancer. Smoking and asbestos exposure have a multiplicative ( synergistic ) effect on the risk of lung cancer. Symptoms include chronic cough, chest pain, breathlessness,  haemoptysis  (coughing up blood), wheezing or hoarseness of the voice, weight loss and fatigue. Treatment involves surgical removal of the cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these (multimodality treatment). Prognosis is generally poor unless the cancer is detected in its early stages. Out of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer, only 15% survive for five years after diagnosis.\nLung Cancer Alliance (LCA) is a U.S. national nonprofit organization, headquartered in  Washington D.C. . Its stated purpose is to promote lung cancer awareness, reduce lung cancer mortality and end the stigma associated with lung cancer.\nTypes of Lung Cancer. There are two types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Most people diagnosed with lung cancer have non-small cell lung cancer. For each type of cancer, the outlook and the treatment may differ.Non-small cell lung cancer occurs in the airways of the lungs or the outer part of the lungs.he diagnosis of lung cancer is very serious; lung cancer kills more people than colon, breast, and prostate cancer combined. It is more common in men than in women, and African American men are 20 percent more likely than Caucasian men to have lung cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment are important for survival.\nChest X-Ray. If your doctor thinks you have lung cancer, chances are you will have a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis. On a chest X-ray of someone with lung cancer, there is usually a visible mass or nodule. This mass will look like a white spot on your lungs, while the lung itself will appear black.However, an X-ray may not be able to detect all forms of cancer or smaller lesions.n a chest X-ray of someone with lung cancer, there is usually a visible mass or nodule.

For each type of cancer, the outlook and the treatment may differ.\nLung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, among both men and women.\nPain. Advanced lung cancer that spreads to the lining of a lung or to another area of the body, such as a bone, can cause pain. Tell your doctor if you experience pain.\nSecondhand smoke is smoke that is exhaled by smokers and smoke emitted from the burning end of a lit cigarette, cigar, or pipe. It causes more than 7,000 lung cancer deaths each year in persons who do not smoke.

Not only does smoking increase the risk of lung and oral cancer, it also increases the risk of other respiratory system cancers including cancer of the nose, sinuses, voice box, and throat.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diseases caused by smoking kill more than 480,000 people in the U.S. each year.

Risks from smoking, as they relate to lung disease, include the following:\nSmoking is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer. It causes cancers of the lung, esophagus, larynx, mouth, throat, kidney, bladder, liver, pancreas, stomach, cervix, colon, and rectum, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (1 - 3).n the United States, exposure to secondhand smoke is thought to cause about 34,000 deaths from heart disease each year (1). Exposure to secondhand smoke also increases the risk of stroke by 20 to 30 percent (1). Pregnant women exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk of having a baby with low birth weight (2).\nA pleural effusion is a buildup of extra fluid in the pleural space, which is the space between the lungs and the chest wall. About half of people with cancer develop a pleural effusion.Cancer growing in the pleural space causes a malignant pleural effusion.More than 75% of people with a malignant pleural effusion have lymphoma or cancers of the breast, lung, or ovary.

Malignant means that it can spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. When cancer starts in lung cells, it is called primary lung cancer. The lung is part of the respiratory system. You use your lungs when you breathe.\nThe lungs are a common site for metastasis. If this is the case, the cancer is not considered to be lung cancer. For example, if prostate cancer spreads via the bloodstream to the lungs, it is metastatic prostate cancer (a secondary cancer) in the lung and is not called lung cancer. Lung cancer comprises a group of different types of tumors.\nCancer that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the lung is called lung metastasis. It is not treated in the same way as primary lung cancer. Find out more about lung metastasis. A rare type of cancer called pleural mesothelioma is often mistakenly called a lung cancer. But pleural mesothelioma starts in the pleura covering the lung and is very different from cancer that starts in the lung.\nThis means that the chemotherapy is going to affect them, too.

Smoking is the leading cause of premature, preventable death in this country.\nLung Cancer. Lung Cancer Terms. Learning the definitions of lung cancer terms that may come up over the course of working with your doctor can help you become a more active part of the conversation about your care. Lung Cancer.\nLung cancer is the most common cancer all around the world. According to the American Lung Association, there were 1.8 million new cases in 2012, as well as 1.6 million deaths from lung cancer. The most common type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80 to 85 percent of all cases, according to the Lung Cancer Alliance. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 15 to 20 percent of lung cancers. At the time of diagnosis, two out of three people with SCLC are already in the extensive stage. Anyone can get lung cancer, but smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke is linked to about 90 percent of lung cancer cases.\nLung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells lining air passages. The two most common types are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. The type of cancer is diagnosed based on how the cells look under a microscope.\nCurrently there is no test that can tell us how long a lung cancer has been growing or when it started. The rate of cancer growth and spread varies from person to person and between types of cancer (breast and prostate cancer, for example). Lung cancer, unfortunately, tends to be a fast-growing, early-spreading cancer. There are many steps in the development and growth of lung cancer. First, changes must take place in a cell or group of cells that lead to uncontrolled division and growth.\nNumerous cancers are associated with cigar smoking: 1  oral cancer, including cancers of the lip, tongue, mouth. 2  throat cancer. 3  esophageal cancer.  lung cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the risk is less than that of cigarette smokers, because most people do not inhale cigar 1  smoke. cancer of the pancreas.  bladder cancer.\nNumerous cancers are associated with cigar smoking: 1  oral cancer, including cancers of the lip, tongue, mouth. 2  throat cancer. 3  esophageal cancer.  lung cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the risk is less than that of cigarette smokers, because most people do not inhale cigar smoke.\nCancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the lungs, it is called lung cancer. Lung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs also may spread to the lungs. When cancer cells spread from one organ to another, they are called metastases. Lung cancers usually are grouped into two main types called small cell and non-small cell. These types of lung cancer grow differently and are treated differently.\nTypes of non-small cell lung cancer. There are 2 main types of lung cancer: About 80% to 85% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) About 10% to 15% are small cell lung cancer (SCLC)\nLung cancer. Lung cancer kills more people than any other kind of cancer. Each year, more than 170,000 new cases of lung cancer occur in the United States, and about 160,000 people die from it. Smoking is the direct cause of almost 90 percent of all lung cancer cases.\n1 Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung. 2  There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer. 3  Smoking increases the risk of non-small cell lung cancer. 4  Signs of non-small cell lung cancer include a cough that doesn't go away and shortness of breath.

They help tell if your bone cancer has spread into your lungs, liver, or other organs. These scans also show the lymph nodes and distant organs where metastatic cancer might be present.Before the test you may be asked to drink 1 or 2 pints of a contrast agent.T scans are helpful in staging cancer. They help tell if your bone cancer has spread into your lungs, liver, or other organs. These scans also show the lymph nodes and distant organs where metastatic cancer might be present.\nTypes. Types of Lung Cancer. There are two main types of lung cancer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to know which type you have. Stages of Lung Cancer.

Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.\nMany people diagnosed with lung cancer will also see a pulmonologist, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uncommon for lung cancer to be diagnosed by these specialists. A pulmonologist is a lung specialist who treats lung diseases including lung cancer. Since lung diseases such as COPD often exist along with lung cancer, and because lung cancer surgery can reduce lung function, a lung specialist is often included as part of your lung cancer team.\nLung carcinoid tumors (also known as lung carcinoids) are a type of lung cancer, which is a cancer that starts in the lungs. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body.ot much is known about what causes lung carcinoid tumors. Researchers have learned a lot about how certain risk factors like cancer-causing chemicals or radiation can cause changes in lung cells that lead to carcinomas, the more common type of lung cancer.\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in males and females in the United States. The incidence of lung cancer is about 60 cases per 100,000 population, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15-25% cases of lung cancer.\nFor Women: Breast cancer is the leading cancer for women in the US.

Several types of cancer, including leukemia and lung tumors, can cause symptoms that mimic a bad cough or bronchitis. One way to tell the difference: The problems persist, or go away and come back again in a repeating cycle. Some lung cancer patients report chest pain that extends up into the shoulder or down the arm. For Women Only: Cancer Symptoms You're Most Likely to Ignore. 3. Swallowing problems or hoarseness. Most commonly associated with esophageal or throat cancer, difficulty swallowing is sometimes one of the first signs of lung cancer, too.\nFor Women: Breast cancer is the leading cancer for women in the US.

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so important to understand lung cancer and how it affects your body. The Effects of Lung Cancer. Your lungs are part of a system of organs and tissues that allow you to breathe. They perform this role by taking air into your body and then moving waste gases back out. When you have lung cancer, abnormal (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cmalignant\u00e2\u0080\u009d) cells form a cancerous tumor in your lungs. These cancer cells begin to damage and destroy your lung tissue. Malignant lung tumors may grow very quickly. The American Lung Association (ALA) notes that the uncontrollable growth of a tumor may block your airways, making it difficult to breathe. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, sometimes cancerous tumors may spread from one part of your body to another. This happens when a tumor sheds malignant cells, which may then be transported to other parts of your body. The cell may be carried either through lymph fluid that surrounds your lung tissue or through your bloodstream. What Causes Lung Cancer? The Mayo Clinic reports that smokers have the highest risk of developing lung cancer.\nIf this is the case, the cancer is not considered to be lung cancer. For example, if prostate cancer spreads via the bloodstream to the lungs, it is metastatic prostate cancer (a secondary cancer) in the lung and is not called lung cancer. Lung cancer comprises a group of different types of tumors.\nLung Cancer Quick Overview. Lung cancer is a group of diseases characterized by abnormal growths (cancers) that started in the lungs.

Smokers die not only of lung cancer but also of cancers of the mouth, larynx (throat), esophagus, bladder, kidney, cervix, and blood (leukemia). 87% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking.\nWhat is Lung Cancer. Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that start off in one or both lungs; usually in the cells that line the air passages. The abnormal cells do not develop into healthy lung tissue, they divide rapidly and form tumors.\nPrint |. Metastatic breast cancer (also called stage IV or advanced breast cancer) is breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast to other organs in the body (most often the bones, lungs, liver or brain).Although metastatic breast cancer has spread to another part of the body, it is considered and treated as breast cancer.For example, breast cancer that has spread to the bones is still breast cancer (not bone cancer) and is treated with breast cancer drugs, rather than treatments for a cancer that began in the bones.etastatic breast cancer (also called stage IV or advanced breast cancer) is breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast to other organs in the body (most often the bones, lungs, liver or brain).

It should be noted that whilst coughing up blood (haemoptysis) usually presenting as phlegm with blood in it, is perceived as being a sure sign of lung cancer, this is not always the case. There are many reasons why people cough up blood that have nothing to do with lung cancer. The most common reason is chest infection. Additional causes include nosebleeds, occasionally bleeding in the throat, irritation in the airways (tracheobronchitis) or inflammation of the stomach or oesophagus.\nLung cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs. The most common type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC makes up about 80 to 85 percent of all cases.

Small cell lung cancer makes up about 15 percent of all lung cancers, with the remainder being non-small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer occurs almost exclusively in smokers, particularly heavy smokers, and former smokers. It is usually an aggressive cancer that tends to grow and spread quickly.\nTreating Small Cell Lung Cancer.

This growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. The most common symptoms are coughing, weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest\nThere two main types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These categories refer to what the cancer cells look like under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer. Staging. If lung cancer is diagnosed, other tests are done to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This process is called staging. The type and stage of lung cancer tells doctors what kind of treatment you need. For more information, visit Stages of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Stages of Small Cell Lung Cancer. Types of Treatment. Lung cancer is treated in several ways, depending on the type of lung cancer and how far it has spread. People with non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. People with small cell lung cancer are usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Surgery. An operation where doctors cut out cancer tissue. Chemotherapy. Using special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. The drugs can be pills you take or medicines given in your veins, or sometimes both. Radiation therapy.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer.\nWhat Is Lung Cancer? Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both lungs. These abnormal cells do not carry out the functions of normal lung cells and do not develop into healthy lung tissue. As they grow, the abnormal cells can form tumors and interfere with the functioning of the lung, which provides oxygen to the body via the blood. The Genetic Basis of Lung Cancer\nLung Cancer. Lung cancer (cancer of the lung) is common worldwide. Around 8 in 10 cases develop in people over the age of 60 years, usually in smokers. If lung cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, there is a chance of a cure. In general, the more advanced the cancer (the more it has grown and spread), the less chance that treatment will be curative.\nThey also can cause penile cancers, anal cancers, and throat cancers. Recent studies have also shown that there may even be an association between HPV and lung cancer. Smoking, of course, is a major cause of lung cancer in the Western world. However, it is not the only cause of lung cancer.\nLung cancer can affect any part of the lung. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both women and men in the United States, Canada, and China. Two main types of lung cancer exist: small-cell lung cancer (SCLC, also called oat cell cancer) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Small-cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of lung cancer.Small-cell lung cancer differs from non-small-cell lung cancer in the following ways:\nThis is how doctors can tell that it is cancer that has spread from another part of the body. Metastatic cancer has the same name as the primary cancer. For example, breast cancer that spreads to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer. It is treated as stage IV breast cancer, not as lung cancer. Sometimes when people are diagnosed with metastatic cancer, doctors cannot tell where it started. This type of cancer is called cancer of unknown primary origin, or CUP. See the Carcinoma of Unknown Primary page for more information.\nLung cancer mainly occurs in older people. About 2 out of 3 people diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older; fewer than 2% of all cases are found in people younger than 45. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 70.Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 13; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 16.These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers.ung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. Lung cancer accounts for about 13% of all new cancers.\nAge and lung cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The risk of developing lung cancer increases with age. Lung cancer can occur in young people, although it is unusual in people younger than 40 years old.

After age 40, the risk for developing lung cancer slowly increases every year.\nCT lung screening is a noninvasive, painless procedure that uses low-dose x-rays to screen the lungs for cancer in just 30 seconds. A CT lung screening allows the radiologist to look at different levels, or slices, of the lungs using a rotating X-ray beam. It is performed on a multislice spiral computed tomography (CT) scanner and can detect smaller nodules or cancer than standard chest X-rays. A tumor or nodule is a mass of cells that grows on the lungs. It can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). By detecting malignant tumors in an early stage with CT lung screening, the cancer cells can be treated at a time when the cancer still has promising survival rates and is localized to the lungs.\nSmoking is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer. It causes cancers of the lung, esophagus, larynx, mouth, throat, kidney, bladder, liver, pancreas, stomach, cervix, colon, and rectum, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (1-3).\nExperiment of 400 cigarettes No wonder why humans get lung cancer !!
