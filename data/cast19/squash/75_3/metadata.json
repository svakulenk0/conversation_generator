{"input_text": "The  wild turkey  was a very important food animal to Native Americans, but it was eliminated from much of its range by the early 20th century. Large groups of these birds can be observed on or near LA-Forestry rds 430 (Marlow Road) and 431 (Drakes Fork Road) that is off LA 10 just west of Cravens.\nThe  conquistador es eventually combined their imported diet of rice, beef, pork, chicken, wine, garlic and onions with the native pre-Columbian food, including maize, tomato,  vanilla ,  avocado ,  guava ,  papaya ,  pineapple ,  chili pepper ,  bean s,  squash ,  sweet potato , peanut, and  turkey .\nEagle ,  hawk  and  turkey  were buried in graves, covered with slabs of stone like human burials, suggesting an important role in the people's culture and beliefs.  For instance, below ground of Room 12, a dual-hearth room believed to be used for ceremonial purposes, contained a bird burial near human burials.\nNative American cuisine includes all food practices of the  indigenous peoples of the Americas . Modern-day native peoples retain a rich culture of traditional foods, some of which have become iconic of present-day Native American social gatherings (for example,  frybread ). Foods like  cornbread ,  turkey ,  cranberry ,  blueberry ,  hominy  and  mush  are known to have been adopted into the cuisine of the United States from Native American groups. In other cases, documents from the early periods of contact with European, African, and Asian peoples allow the recovery of food practices which passed out of popularity.\nThe Cumanagotos were  Amerindian s of northeastern Venezuela at the time of the Spanish conquest. Since the 17th century they have not existed as a tribal or cultural unit. The Cumanagoto spoke a  Cariban language , related to that of the  Palenque . They were agricultural, growing  corn  (maize),  manioc ,  sweet potato es, and other native crops, as well as  coca trees . Wild foods were also gathered, and hunting was important. Domesticated animals were uncommon, except for  turkey s. Their villages often had wooden palisades for defense. Dress was minimal, consisting of a small genital covering and decorative ornaments of feathers, pearls, gold, shell, clay beads, coral beads, bones, teeth, or flowers.  Polygyny  was practiced by chiefs, whose wives lived together in a kind of harem. Religion centered on worship of the sun and moon.\nThe wild turkey, throughout its range, plays a significant role in the cultures of many  Native American tribe s all over North America. Outside of the Thanksgiving feast, it is a favorite meal in eastern tribes. Eastern Native American tribes consumed both the eggs and meat, sometimes turning the latter into a type of jerky to preserve it and make it last through cold weather. They provided habitat by burning down portions of forests to create meadows which would attract mating birds, and thus give a clear shot to hunters. The feathers of turkeys also often made their way into the rituals and headgear of many tribes. Many leaders, such as  Catawba  chiefs, traditionally wore turkey feather headdresses. Significant peoples of several tribes, including  Muscogee Creek  and  Wampanoag , wore turkey feather cloaks. The turkey clan is one of the three  Lenape  clans. Movements of wild turkeys inspired the  Caddo  tribe's  turkey dance .The  Navajo people  of Southeastern Arizona, New Mexico and Utah call the turkey  T\u0105zhii and relate the bird to the corn and seeds which The Turkey in Navajo folklore brought from the Third Navajo World.  It is one of the Navajos' sacred birds, with the Navajo people using the feathers and parts in multiple traditional ceremonies.\nThe south Mexican wild turkey is considered the  nominate subspecies , and the only one that is not found in the United States or Canada. In central Mexico, archaeological M. gallopavo bones have been identified at sites dating to 800\u2013100 BC [10], [11]. It is unclear whether these early specimens represent wild or domestic individuals, but domestic turkeys were likely established in central Mexico by the first half of the Classic Period (c. AD 200\u20131000).  Late Preclassic (300 BC\u2013AD 100) turkey remains identified at the archaeological site of El Mirador (Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala) represent the earliest evidence of the export of the Mexican turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) to the ancient Maya world.  The  Mexican  subspecies, M. g. gallopavo, was  domesticated , either in Mexico or by Preclassic peoples in  Mesoamerica , giving rise to the  domestic turkey . The Spaniards brought this tamed subspecies back to Europe with them in the mid-16th century; from Spain it spread to France and later Britain as a farmyard animal, usually becoming the centerpiece of a feast for the well-to-do. By 1620 it was common enough so that Pilgrim settlers of Massachusetts could bring turkeys with them from  England , unaware that it had a larger close relative already occupying the forests of Massachusetts. It is one of the smallest subspecies and is best known in Spanish from its Aztec-derived name, guajolote. This wild turkey subspecies is thought to be critically endangered, as of 2010.\nThe species Meleagris gallopavo is used by humans for their meat. However, they were first domesticated by the indigenous people of Mexico from at least 800 BC onwards.  These domesticates were then either introduced into what is now the Southwest US or independently domesticated a second time by the indigenous people of that region by 200 BC, at first for their feathers, which were used in ceremonies and to make robes and blankets. Turkeys were first used for meat by Native Americans by about AD 1100. Compared to wild turkeys, domestic turkeys are selectively bred to grow larger in size for their meat. Humans normally eat turkeys on special occasions such as at  Thanksgiving  or  Christmas .\nThe modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six  subspecies  of  wild turkey  (Meleagris gallopavo) found in the present Mexican states of  Jalisco ,  Guerrero  and  Veracruz .  Pre-Aztec tribes in south-central Mexico first domesticated the bird around 800 BC, and Pueblo Indians inhabiting the Colorado Plateau in the United States did likewise around 200 BC. They used the feathers for robes, blankets, and ceremonial purposes.  More than 1,000 years later, they became an important food source.  The first Europeans to encounter the bird misidentified it as a guineafowl, a bird known as a \"turkey fowl\" at that time because it had been introduced into Europe via Turkey.\nIn the late 1770\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Benjamin Franklin suggested that the turkey should be the symbol for the fledgling United States. He argued that the bald eagle was no better than a pirate and a fish-eater (mostly true). The American turkey lost to the bald eagle by a single congressional vote. Native Americans in the Southwest and Mexico kept turkeys for feathers and food, and the birds, with their alarm calls, probably were good watch dogs as well. The Indians used the feathers in ceremonies, and they twisted and plaited the feathers with twine to form blankets.\n1 Gaujalote (Spanish) 2  The Wild Turkey and the Muscovy Duck are the only two domesticated birds native to the New World.

Native Americans hunted them for food, and some natives even domesticated the big birds. Later, the wild turkey became a steady food source for settlers.
