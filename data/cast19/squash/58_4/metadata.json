{"input_text": "The Jedox OLAP database is a memory-based, multi-dimensional real-time OLAP server ( MOLAP ) that administers economic or statistical data stocks ( multi-dimensional database ). Apart from multi-dimensional queries, data can be  written back  and consolidated in real-time. The server keeps all data in the cache for fast data access.  API s in Java, PHP, C/C++, or .NET can be used to integrate the Jedox OLAP database in other software environments.\nA NoSQL (originally referring to \"non SQL\", \"non relational\" or \"not only SQL\") database provides a mechanism for  storage  and  retrieval  of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in  relational database s. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the \"NoSQL\" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century, triggered by the needs of  Web 2.0  companies such as  Facebook ,  Google , and  Amazon.com . NoSQL databases are increasingly used in  big data  and  real-time web  applications.   NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support  SQL -like query languages.\nThe key RTLinux design objective was to add hard real-time capabilities to a commodity operating system to facilitate the development of complex control programs with both capabilities. For example, one might want to develop a real-time motor controller that used a commodity database and exported a web operator interface. Instead of attempting to build a single operating system that could support real-time and non-real-time capabilities, RTLinux was designed to share a computing device between a real-time and non-real-time operating system so that (1) the real-time operating system could never be blocked from execution by the non-real-time operating system and (2) components running in the two different environments could easily share data. As the name implies RTLinux was originally designed to use Linux as the non-real-time system but it eventually evolved so that the RTCore real-time kernel could run with either Linux or  BSD UNIX .\nReal-time Business Intelligence systems are  event driven , and may use  Complex Event Processing ,  Event Stream Processing  and  Mashup (web application hybrid)  techniques to enable events to be analysed without being first transformed and stored in a database. These  in-memory database  techniques have the advantage that high rates of events can be monitored, and since data does not have to be written into databases data latency can be reduced to milliseconds.\nData philanthropy plays an important role in  academia . Researchers encounter countless obstacles whilst attempting to access data. This data is available to a limited number of researchers with sole access to restricted resources who are authorized to utilize this information; like social media streams enabling them to produce more  knowledge  and develop new studies. For example, Twitter markets access to its real-time APIs at exorbitant prices, which often surpasses the budgets of most researchers. 'Data Grants\u2019 is a trial program created by Twitter that provides a selective number of academics and researchers with access to real-time databases in order to garner more knowledge. They apply to gain entry into vast data downloads, on specific topics.\nFor example, there is an ACM Queue interview with Jim Ready, founder of MontaVista (realtime linux company), \"Interview with Jim Reddy\", April 2003, ACM Queue . He says in the interview, \"The single, most successful RTOS in Japan historically is \u00b5ITRON. This is an indigenous open specification led by Dr. Ken Sakamura of the University of Tokyo. It is an industry standard there.\" Many Japanese digital cameras, for example, have use ITRON specification OS. Toyota automobile has used ITRON specification OS for engine control.\nFirebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. The company provides client libraries that enable integration with  Android ,  iOS ,  JavaScript ,  Java ,  Objective-C ,  swift  and  Node.js  applications. The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several  JavaScript frameworks  such as  AngularJS ,  React ,  Ember.js  and  Backbone.js . The REST API uses the  Server-Sent Events  protocol, which is an API for creating HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. Developers using the realtime database can secure their data by using the company's server-side-enforced security rules.\nA characteristic of modern database applications is that they facilitate simultaneous updates and queries from multiple users. Systems in the 1970s might have accomplished this by having each user in front of a  3270  terminal to a  mainframe computer . By the mid-1980s it was becoming more common to give each user a  personal computer  and have a program running on that PC that connected to a database  server . Information would be pulled from the database, transmitted over a network, and then arranged, graphed, or otherwise formatted by the program running on the PC. Starting in the mid-1990s it became more common to build database applications with a Web interface. Rather than develop custom software to run on a user's PC, the user would use the same Web browser program for every application. A database application with a Web interface had the advantage that it could be used on devices of different sizes, with different hardware, and with different operating systems. Examples of early database applications with Web interfaces include  amazon.com , which used the  Oracle relational database management system , the photo.net online community, whose implementation on top of  Oracle  was described in the book Database-Backed Web Sites (Ziff-Davis Press; May 1997), and  eBay , also running Oracle.\nReal-time computing is sometimes misunderstood to be  high-performance computing , but this is not an accurate classification. For example, a massive  supercomputer  executing a scientific simulation may offer impressive performance, yet it is not executing a real-time computation. Conversely, once the hardware and software for an anti-lock braking system have been designed to meet its required deadlines, no further performance gains are obligatory. Furthermore, if a network server is highly loaded with network traffic, its response time may be slower but will (in most cases) still succeed before it times out (hits its deadline). Hence, such a network server would not be considered a real-time system: temporal failures (delays, time-outs, etc.) are typically small and compartmentalized (limited in effect) but are not catastrophic failures. In a real-time system, such as the  FTSE 100 Index , a slow-down beyond limits would often be considered catastrophic in its application context. Therefore, the most important requirement of a real-time system is predictability and not performance.\nThe primary competitors like  Microsoft SQL Server  and MySQL supported  online transaction processing  and  online analytical processing  but were not distributed. Clustrix provides a distributed relational,  ACID  database that scales transactions and support real-time analytics. Other distributed relational databases are  columnar  (they don't support primary transaction workload) and focus on offline analytics and this includes  EMC Greenplum ,  HP Vertica ,  Infobright , and  Amazon Redshift . Notable players in the primary SQL database space are  in-memory . This includes  VoltDB  and  MemSQL , which excel at low-latency transactions, but do not target real-time analytics. NoSQL competitors, like  MongoDB  are good at handling unstructured data and read heavy workloads, but do not compete in the space for write heavy workloads (no transactions, coarse grained (DB-level)  locking , and no SQL features (like  joins ), so the NewSQL and NoSQL databases are complementary.\nOperational databases are used to store, manage and track real-time business information. For example, a company might have an operational database used to track warehouse/stock quantities. As customers order products from an online web store, an operational database can be used to keep track of how many items have been sold and when the company will need to reorder stock.  An operational database stores information about the activities of an  organization , for example  customer relationship management  transactions or financial operations, in a computer  database .\nThis is an era of real-time systems. Customers want to see the current status of their order in e-shop, the current status of a parcel delivery\u2014a real time parcel tracking\u2014, the current balance on their account, etc. This shows the need of a real-time system, which is being updated as well to enable smooth manufacturing process in real-time, e.g., ordering material when enterprise is running out stock, synchronizing customer orders with manufacturing process, etc. From real life, there exist so many examples where real-time processing gives successful and competitive advantage.\nStarcounter can be likened by  Oracle 's  TimesTen  in-memory database and  SAP HANA . What these have in common is that they are all based on in-memory technology and are often targeted towards customers that use real-time applications. The main difference is the way the  database management system  is integrated. SAP HANA makes use of a  column-oriented database management system . TimesTen, on the other hand, uses a  relational database management system  (RDBMS). Starcounter is unique in that it uses an object-oriented approach that is integrated with the application (VMDBMS) with an underlying RDMBS .\nThe Series/1 was also widely used in manufacturing environments, including  General Motors  assembly plants.   Example systems and applications included Manufacturing Information Database (MIDB), Vehicle Component Verification System (VCVS) and  Assembly Line Diagnostic Link  (ALDL). These systems were connected to plant floor devices and used in the realtime manufacture of vehicles. There was also a Time and Attendance (T&A) system connected to badge readers and employee turnstiles. Series/1 computers where also utilized in the early development of GM's  Manufacturing Automation Protocol  (MAP)\nA real-time database is a database system which uses  real-time processing  to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing. This differs from traditional databases containing persistent data, mostly unaffected by time. For example, a stock market changes very rapidly and is dynamic. The graphs of the different markets appear to be very unstable and yet a database has to keep track of current values for all of the markets of  the New York Stock Exchange . Real-time processing means that a transaction is processed fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away. Real-time databases are useful for accounting, banking, law,  medical record s,  multi-media , process control, reservation systems, and scientific data analysis.\nHe founded the NASA Ames Mission Design Center (MDC) and developed its software architecture. The Ames MDC was the first of its kind to make extensive use of groupware, for example in pooling knowledge to create and maintain spacecraft parts databases. Another innovation was the use of a centralized parametric mission design archive that enables realtime concurrent design collaboration and object-oriented style 'inheritance' of missions to promote reuse of designs and the growth of design trees.\nObjectStore was originally created in 1988 by  Object Design, Incorporated , which was based in  Burlington, Massachusetts  and founded by several former Symbolics employees, including  Daniel Weinreb . In 2002 the product was acquired by  Progress Software , which continued to develop the technology, expanding its use beyond the object database market to target uses as a database for  real-time computing , specifically designed for  RFID  data management, and as a  cache  for relational databases.\nAerospike is the company behind the Aerospike open source  NoSQL  distributed  database  which has a horizontally scalable high-speed lightweight data layer. Citrusleaf, a Mountain View, California based company which  rebranded  to Aerospike in August 2012, launched the database in 2011. The company purpose-built the database for  developers  to deploy real-time big data applications.\nSQLstream provides a relational stream processing platform called SQLstream Blaze for analyzing large volumes of service, sensor and machine and log file data in real-time. It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data.  Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard  SQL language , using the  ANSI  standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional  RDBMS  SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries do not exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored.  Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement.  For example, partitioning by a customer id would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer.  This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution.   SQLstream Blaze also allows changes to be made to the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications.  This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application.  Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules.  In this way, it provides an effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data.  SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally.  Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases.  SQLstream is able to execute its queries in an optimized C++ multi-threaded dataflow engine which operates lock-free.  This enables people to create lock-free parallel processing applications easily, which otherwise require specialist skillets and are often difficult to get working and are often error prone.\nExamples include  Oracle NoSQL Database ,  Redis , and  dbm .\nSeveral methods exist to aid the design of real-time systems, an example of which is  MASCOT , an old but very successful method which represents the  concurrent  structure of the system. Other examples are  HOOD , Real-Time UML,  AADL , the  Ravenscar profile , and  Real-Time Java .\nMnesia is a  distributed ,  soft real-time   database management system  written in the  Erlang programming language .  It is distributed as part of the  Open Telecom Platform .\nOnce when the  MOS Technology 6502  (used in the  Commodore 64  and  Apple II ), and later when the  Motorola 68000  (used in the  Macintosh ,  Atari ST , and  Commodore Amiga ) were popular, anybody could use their home computer as a real-time system. The possibility to deactivate other interrupts allowed for hard-coded loops with defined timing, and the low  interrupt latency  allowed the implementation of a real-time operating system, giving the user interface and the disk drives lower priority than the real-time thread. Compared to these the  programmable interrupt controller  of the Intel CPUs (8086..80586) generates a very large latency and the Windows operating system is neither a real-time operating system nor does it allow a program to take over the CPU completely and use its own  scheduler , without using native machine language and thus surpassing all interrupting Windows code. However, several coding libraries exist which offer real time capabilities in a high level language on a variety of operating systems, for example  Java Real Time . The  Motorola 68000  and subsequent family members (68010, 68020 etc.) also became popular with manufacturers of industrial control systems. This application area is one in which real-time control offers genuine advantages in terms of process performance and safety.\nOnline collaborative sensor data management platforms are on-line database services that allow sensor owners to register and connect their devices to feed data into an online database for storage and also allow developers to connect to the database and build their own applications based on that data. Examples include  Xively  and the Wikisensing platform. Such platforms simplify online collaboration between users over diverse data sets ranging from energy and environment data to that collected from transport services. Other services include allowing developers to embed real-time graphs & widgets in websites; analyse and process historical data pulled from the data feeds; send real-time alerts from any datastream to control scripts, devices and environments.\nMarineTraffic is an open, community-based project, which provides real-time information on the movements of ships and current location of ships in harbours and ports. A database of information on the vessels include for example details of location where they were built plus dimensions of the vessels, gross tonnage and  International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number . Users can submit photographs of the vessels which other users can rate.\nTraditional databases are persistent but are incapable of dealing with dynamic data that constantly changes. Therefore, another system is needed. Real-time databases may be modified to improve accuracy and efficiency and to avoid conflict, by providing deadlines and wait periods to insure temporal consistency. Real-time database systems offer a way of monitoring a physical system and representing it in data streams to a database. A data stream, like memory, fades over time. In order to guarantee that the freshest and most accurate information is recorded there are a number of ways of checking transactions to make sure they are executed in the proper order. An online auction house provides an example of a rapidly changing database.\nOne of the problems facing real-time ocean observatories is the ability to provide a fast and accurate assessment of the data quality. Ocean Networks Canada is in the process of implementing real-time quality control on incoming data. For scalar data, the aim is to meet the guidelines of the Quality Assurance of Real Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD) group. QARTOD is a US organization tasked with identifying issues involved with incoming real-time data from the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). A large portion of their agenda is to create guidelines for how the quality of real-time data is to be determined and reported to the scientific community. Real-time data quality testing at Ocean Networks Canada includes tests designed to catch instrument failures and major spikes or data dropouts before the data is made available to the user. Real-time quality tests include meeting instrument manufacturer\u2019s standards and overall observatory/site ranges determined from previous data. Due to the positioning of some instrument platforms in highly productive areas, we have also designed dual-sensor tests e.g. for some conductivity sensors. The quality control testing is split into 3 separate categories. The first category is in real-time and tests the data before the data are parsed into the database. The second category is delayed-mode testing where archived data are subject to testing after a certain period of time. The third category is manual quality control by an Ocean Networks Canada data expert.\nContent awareness (or \"content collection\") is usually either a push or pull model. In the push model, a source system is integrated with the search engine in such a way that it connects to it and pushes new content directly to its  API s. This model is used when realtime indexing is important. In the pull model, the software gathers content from sources using a connector such as a  web crawler  or a  database  connector. The connector typically polls the source with certain intervals to look for new, updated or deleted content.\nExamples of database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Access, Oracle, Sybase, DB2.\nClusterpoint database enables to perform  transactions  in a distributed document database model in the same way as in a  SQL  database.  Users can perform secure real-time updates, free text search, analytical SQL querying and reporting at high velocity in  very large distributed databases  containing XML or JSON document type data.  Transactions  are implemented without database consistency issues plaguing most of  NoSQL  databases and can safely run at high-performance speed previously available only with  relational databases .  Real time   Big data  analytics, replication, loadsharing and high-availability are standard features of Clusterpoint database software platform.\nThe Platform Layer includes the following core functionality to all modules: OPC-UA Client, Database, Web Server, System Logging, Licensing, Unified Development Environment, Auditing, Authentication, Module API, Alerting Core Functionality, Database Connectivity, Scripting Engine, Realtime Tag Database, Store & Forward, and Redundancy.\nCritical threats are usually maintained in a prioritized file, with important enemy capabilities analyzed on a schedule set by an estimate of the enemy's preparation time. For example, nuclear threats between the USSR and the U.S. were analyzed in real time by continuously on-duty staffs. In contrast, analysis of tank or army deployments are usually triggered by accumulations of fuel and munitions, which are monitored every few days. In some cases, automated analysis is performed in real time on automated data traffic.\nReal-time databases are traditional databases that use an extension to give the additional power to yield reliable responses. They use timing constraints that represent a certain range of values for which the data are valid. This range is called temporal validity. A conventional database cannot work under these circumstances because the inconsistencies between the real world objects and the data that represents them are too severe for simple modifications. An effective system needs to be able to handle time-sensitive queries, return only temporally valid data, and support priority scheduling. To enter the data in the records, often a sensor or an input device monitors the state of the physical system and updates the database with new information to reflect the physical system more accurately. When designing a real-time  database system , one should consider how to represent valid time, how facts are associated with  real-time system . Also, consider how to represent attribute values in the database so that process transactions and data consistency have no violations.\nThe amount of research studying real-time database systems will increase because of commercial applications such as web based auction houses like e-bay. More developing countries are expanding their phone systems, and the number of people with cell phones in the United States as well as other places in the world continues to grow. Also likely to spur real-time research is the exponentially increasing speed of the microprocessor. This also enables new technologies such as web-video conferencing and instant messenger conversations in sound and high-resolution video, which are reliant on real-time database systems. Studies of temporal consistency result in new protocols and timing constraints with the goal of handling real-time transactions more effectively.\nIn contrast, real time data processing involves a continual input, process and output of data. Data must be processed in a small time period (or near real time). Radar systems, customer services and bank ATMs are examples.\nBest Answer: SAP means Systems, Applications and Products in data processing. SAP is the third largest software company in the world. SAP is the largest business application and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution software provider in terms of revenue. SAP's products focus on ERP, which it helped to pioneer. The company's main product is MySAP ERP. The name of its predecessor, SAP R/3 give a clue to its functionality: the R stands for realtime data processing and the number 3 relates to a 3-tier architecture: database, application server and client (SAPgui).\nSometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as more flexible than relational database tables. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called Not only SQL to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages.ometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as more flexible than relational database tables.
