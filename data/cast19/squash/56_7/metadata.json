{"input_text": "Microevolution over time leads to  speciation  or the appearance of novel structure, sometimes classified as  macroevolution . Macro and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different scales.\nIn progressive creationism, the creation occurred in rapid bursts in which all \"kinds\" of  plant s and  animal s appear in stages lasting millions of years.  The bursts are followed by periods of stasis or equilibrium to accommodate new arrivals.  These bursts represent instances of  God  creating new types of organisms by divine intervention.  As viewed from the archaeological record, progressive creationism holds that \"species do not gradually appear by the steady transformation of its ancestors; [but] appear all at once and \"fully formed.\" The view rejects  macroevolution , claiming it is biologically untenable and not supported by the  fossil record , and it rejects the concept of universal descent from a  last universal common ancestor . Thus the evidence for macroevolution is claimed to be false, but microevolution is accepted as a genetic parameter designed by the Creator into the fabric of genetics to allow for environmental adaptations and survival.\nSimpson argued that the  microevolution  of  population genetics  was sufficient in itself to explain the patterns of  macroevolution  observed by  paleontology . Simpson also highlighted the distinction between tempo and mode. \"Tempo\" encompasses \"evolutionary rates . . . their acceleration and deceleration, the conditions of exceptionally slow or rapid evolutions, and phenomena suggestive of inertia and momentum\", while \"mode\" embraces \"the study of the way, manner, or pattern of evolution, a study in which tempo is a basic factor, but which embraces considerably more than tempo.\"\nIn  young Earth creationism  and  baraminology  a central tenet is that evolution can explain diversity in a limited number of  created kind s which can interbreed (which they call \"microevolution\") while the formation of new \"kinds\" (which they call \"macroevolution\") is impossible. This acceptance of \"microevolution\" only within a \"kind\" is also typical of  old Earth creationism .\nWithin the  modern evolutionary synthesis  school of thought, macroevolution is thought of as the compounded effects of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental onethe only difference between them is of time and scale. As  Ernst W. Mayr  observes, \"transspecific evolution is nothing but an extrapolation and magnification of the events that take place within populations and species...it is misleading to make a distinction between the causes of micro- and macroevolution\". However, time is not a necessary distinguishing factormacroevolution can happen without gradual compounding of small changes;  whole-genome duplication  can result in speciation occurring over a single generation - this is especially common in plants.\nHowever, as biologists define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution have been observed.  Speciation s, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes described by the theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is  ring species .\nScientific organizations such as the  American Association for the Advancement of Science  describe microevolution as small scale change within species, and macroevolution as the formation of new species, but otherwise not being different from microevolution. In macroevolution, an accumulation of microevolutionary changes leads to speciation. The main difference between the two processes is that one occurs within a few generations, whilst the other takes place over thousands of years (i.e. a quantitative difference). Essentially they describe the same process; although evolution beyond the species level results in beginning and ending generations which could not interbreed, the intermediate generations could.\nMicroevolution is the change in  allele frequencies  that occurs over time within a population. This change is due to four different processes:  mutation , selection ( natural  and  artificial ),  gene flow , and  genetic drift . This change happens over a relatively short (in evolutionary terms) amount of time compared to the changes termed 'macroevolution' which is where greater differences in the population occur.\nCreationists  have taken Kerkut's points as evidence against evolution and interpreted them to support their own claims. In his book, Kerkut distinguished between the Special Theory of Evolution (often referred to as  microevolution ) and what he termed the General Theory of Evolution (often referred to as  macroevolution , but also including  abiogenesis ).\nCreationist biology centers on an idea derived from Genesis that states that life was created by God, in a finite number of \"created kinds,\" rather than through biological evolution from a common ancestor. Creationists consider that any observable  speciation  descends from these distinctly created kinds through inbreeding, deleterious mutations and other genetic mechanisms. Whereas evolutionary biologists and creationists share similar views of  microevolution , creationists disagree that the process of  macroevolution  can explain common ancestry among organisms far beyond the level of common species. Creationists contend that there is no empirical evidence for new plant or animal species, and deny fossil evidence has ever been found documenting the process.\nThe modern synthesis solved difficulties and confusions caused by the specialisation and poor communication between biologists in the early years of the 20th century. At its heart was the question of whether Mendelian genetics could be reconciled with gradual evolution by means of natural selection. A second issue was whether the broad-scale changes of  macroevolution  seen by palaeontologists could be explained by changes seen in the  microevolution  of local  population s.\nOne of the tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis was that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely the result of the mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating over an extended period of time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Newman |first1=Stuart A. |authorlink1=Stuart Newman |last2=M\u00fcller |first2=Gerd B. |authorlink2=Gerd M\u00fcller (theoretical biologist) |date=December 2000 |title=Epigenetic mechanisms of character origination |journal= Journal of Experimental Zoology  |volume=288 |issue=4 |pages=304\u2013317 |doi=10.1002/1097-010X(20001215)288:4\n\"So it has been hard to find really convincing examples of species-level properties that are built by species-level selection. The problem is to find: (i) traits that are aspects of species, not the organisms making up the species; (ii) traits that are relevant to extinction and survival; and (iii) traits that are transmitted to daughter species, granddaughter species and so forth\". And \"transmission to daughter species is especially problematic\". (p. 177) In the end, Sterelny states his own views are much closer to Dawkins than to Gould's, especially regarding  microevolution \u2014change within local populations. \"But  macroevolution  is not just microevolution scaled up; Gould's paleontological perspective offers real insights into mass extinction and its consequences, and, perhaps, the nature of species and speciation\". And Gould is considered right to expand the explanatory agenda of evolutionary biology to include large-scale patterns in life's history. \"So, Dawkins is right about evolution on local scales, but maybe Gould is right about the relationship between events on a local scale, and those on the vast scale of paleontological time.\" (p. 178)\nThese outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as  macroevolution  versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in  gene frequency  and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one\u2014the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new  habitat s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels\u2014with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as  species selection  acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.\nThe German geneticist  Richard Goldschmidt  was the first scientist to use the term \"hopeful monster\". Goldschmidt thought that small gradual changes could not bridge the hypothetical divide between microevolution and macroevolution. In his book The Material Basis of Evolution (1940) he wrote \"the change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again produce intraspecific variation by micromutation.\" Goldschmidt believed the large changes in evolution were caused by macromutations (large mutations). His ideas about macromutations became known as the hopeful monster hypothesis which is considered a type of saltational evolution.\nSupport for the orthogenesis hypothesis began to decline during the  modern evolutionary synthesis  in the 1940s when it became apparent that it could not explain the complex branching patterns of evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the  fossil record  by paleontologists. A few hung on to the idea of orthogenesis as late as the 1950s by claiming that the processes of  macroevolution , the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of  microevolution .\nBarbieri underlined that copying and coding are two fundamentally different mechanisms of molecular change and suggested that there are two distinct mechanisms of evolutionary change: evolution by natural selection, based on copying, and evolution by natural conventions, based on coding. This in turn implies that many organic codes appeared in the history of life after the genetic code, and Barbieri proposed that the greatest novelties of macroevolution were associated with the origin of new codes. These ideas have been developed in the course of a thirty-year period in the books The Semantic Theory of Evolution (1985), The Organic Codes (2003)   and Code Biology (2015).\nAccording to Goldschmidt, \"biologists seem inclined to think that because they have not themselves seen a 'large' mutation, such a thing cannot be possible. But such a mutation need only be an event of the most extraordinary rarity to provide the world with the important material for evolution\". Goldschmidt believed that the  neo-Darwinian  view of  gradual  accumulation of small  mutation s was important but could account for variation only within species ( microevolution ) and was not a powerful enough source of evolutionary novelty to explain new  species . Instead he believed that large  genetic  differences between species required profound \"macro-mutations\" a source for large genetic changes ( macroevolution ) which once in a while could occur as a \"hopeful monster\".\nMacroevolution includes changes occurring on geological time scales, in contrast to microevolution, which occurs on any time scale.\nMegaevolution describes the most dramatic events in  evolution . It is no longer suggested that the evolutionary processes involved are necessarily special, although in some cases they might be. Whereas  macroevolution  can apply to relatively modest changes that produced diversification of  species  and  genera  and are readily compared to  microevolution , \"megaevolution\" is used for great changes. Megaevolution has been extensively debated because it has been seen as a possible objection to  Charles Darwin 's theory of gradual evolution by  natural selection .\nTheodosius Dobzhansky , a postdoctoral worker in T. H. Morgan's lab, had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity by  Russia n geneticists such as  Sergei Chetverikov . He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of  microevolution  developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of  macroevolution  observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book  Genetics and the Origin of Species . Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. Many more biologists were influenced by population genetics via Dobzhansky than were able to read the highly mathematical works in the original.\nIn biology, macroevolution refers to evolution above the species level while  microevolution  refers to changes within species. However, there is no fundamental distinction between these processes; small changes compound over time and eventually lead to speciation. Creationists argue that a finite number of discrete kinds were created, as described in the Book of Genesis, and these kinds determine the limits of variation. Early Creationists equated kinds with species, but most now accept that speciation can occur: not only is the evidence overwhelming for speciation, but the millions of species now in existence could not have fit in Noah's Ark. Created kinds identified by creationists are more generally on the level of the  family  (for example,  Canidae ), but the genus  Homo  is a separate kind. A Creationist systematics called  Baraminology  builds on the idea of created kind, calling it a baramin. While evolutionary  systematics  is used to explore relationships between organisms by descent, baraminology attempts to find discontinuities between groups of organisms. It employs many of the tools of evolutionary systematics, but Biblical criteria for taxonomy take precedence over all other criteria. This undermines their claim to objectivity: they accept evidence for the common ancestry of cats or dogs but not analogous evidence for the common ancestry of apes and humans.\nHe had also said that he felt the explanations offered by evolution are incomplete, and he found it hard to believe that nature can produce the machinery of cells through random processes.  On his website, he writes that \"From what I can see, microevolution is a fact\" and \"there is no argument regarding microevolution. The core of the debate for me, therefore, is the extrapolation of microevolution to macroevolution.\"\nMacroevolution is  evolution  on a scale at or above the level of  species , in contrast with  microevolution , which refers to smaller evolutionary changes of  allele frequencies  within a species or population. Macroevolution and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time scales.\nMacroevolution and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time scales. Microevolution refers to small evolutionary changes (typically described as changes in allele frequencies) within a species or population. while macroevolution is evolution on a scale of separated gene pools.  Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of  species .\nThe American  George Gaylord Simpson  argued that the paleontological record supported  evolution  in the 1940s. Some creationists, however, objected to his supposed equation of  microevolution  and  macroevolution , acknowledging the former but denying the latter, and continue to do so to this day.\nGoldschmidt was the first scientist to use the term \" hopeful monster \". He thought that small gradual changes could not bridge the hypothetical divide between microevolution and macroevolution. In his book The Material Basis of Evolution (1940), he wrote \"the change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again produce intraspecific variation by micromutation.\" Goldschmidt believed the large changes in  evolution  were caused by macromutations (large mutations). His ideas about macromutations became known as the hopeful monster hypothesis, which is considered a type of  saltational evolution .\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, or the observable characteristics of an organism, but the  genetic  (heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives a reproductive advantage may become  more common in a population . Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular  ecological niche s ( microevolution ) and may eventually result in the  emergence of new species  ( macroevolution ). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which  human s intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.\nMechanisms of Evolutionary Change. Microevolution (evolution on a small-scale) refers to the changes in allele frequencies within a single population. Allele frequencies in a population may change due to four fundamental forces of evolution: Natural Selection, Genetic Drift, Mutations and Gene Flow. Mutations are the ultimate source of new alleles in a gene pool. Two of the most relevant mechanisms of evolutionary change are: Natural Selection and Genetic Drift.\nMicroevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population. This change is due to four different processes: mutation, selection (natural and artificial), gene flow, and genetic drift. This change happens over a relatively short (in evolutionary terms) amount of time compared to the changes termed 'macroevolution' which is where greater differences in the population occur.\nSince microevolution is small-scale (\u00e2\u0080\u009cmicro\u00e2\u0080\u009d) biological change, and macroevolution is large-scale (\u00e2\u0080\u009cmacro\u00e2\u0080\u009d) biological change, many Darwinists argue that macroevolution is simply the accumulation of microevolutionary changes over time. Ostensibly, this is a reasonable extrapolation of microevolution.\nMicroevolution is simply a change in gene frequency within a population. Evolution at this scale can be observed over short periods of time. Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies brought about by mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection below the species level. Over time, microevolution can translate into macroevolution, which is larger scale change above the species level. Microevolution is simply a change in gene frequency within a population. Evolution at this scale can be observed over short periods of time.\nMicroevolution is a credibly observed scientific phenomenon. What Creationists do not believe in is Darwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s macroevolutionary extrapolation of microevolution. Unlike microevolution, there is no true scientific evidence for macroevolution, and, in fact, there is significant evidence against it. The distinction between microevolution and macroevolution is, therefore, an important one for those interested in the creation-vs.-evolution debate.

Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of species.\nIn genetic drift there is a genetic variation among allele frequencies of that population due to random chance. Therefore a small population would allow for higher chance of sampling error and a change in allele frequencies as a result would lead to a misrepresentation of the parent generations gene pool.volutionary Biology. Changes within a gene pool occurring from generation to generation is called microevolution. Allele frequencies in a population may change due to gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection and mutation. These are referred to as the four fundamental forces of evolution.\nMacroevolution is evolution on a scale at or above the level of species, in contrast with microevolution, which refers to smaller evolutionary changes of allele frequencies within a species or population. Macroevolution and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time scales.

Paleontology, evolutionary developmental biology, comparative genomics and genomic\nMacroevolution includes changes occurring on geological time scales, in contrast to microevolution, which occurs on any time scale.

Natural selection acts on individuals, but only populations evolve. Consider, for example, a population of medium ground finches on Daphne Major Island; Microevolution is a change in allele frequencies in a population over generations.\nDarwin did not know that DNA would become an incredibly important part of his Theory of Evolution. In fact, the subcategory of evolution called microevolution is completely based on DNA and the mechanism of how genetic information is passed down from parents to offspring.arwin did not know that DNA would become an incredibly important part of his Theory of Evolution. In fact, the subcategory of evolution called microevolution is completely based on DNA and the mechanism of how genetic information is passed down from parents to offspring.\nMicroevolution and macroevolution are different things, but they involve mostly the same processes. Microevolution is defined as the change of allele frequencies (that is, genetic variation due to processes such as selection, mutation, genetic drift, or even migration) within a population.\nDifference between micro- and macroevolution? Or rather, the mechanisms that cause it. Microevolution is small scale change within a population caused by mechanisms like genetic drift, natural selection, etc. Macroevolution large scale evolutionary change - the collection of different microevolutionary changes.\nMacroevolution is the process that takes place over several thousands of years and describes how humans have evolved from primates and how reptiles turned into birds. Microevolution leads to small changes in the same species whereas macroevolution leads to the creation of a new species from parent species.\nMicroevolution can be contrasted with macroevolution, which is the occurrence of large-scale changes in gene frequencies in a population over a geological time period (i.e. consisting of either rapid or extended microevolution).

COMMENTARY: That's up to you... In honor of Darwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthday, here is a response to yet another unsupported assertion by creationists and ID supporters, who often state (without evidence) that although microevolution might happen, there is no evidence for macroevolution.\nAnother way to state the difference is that macroevolution is between-species evolution and microevolution is within-species evolution. Sometimes, macroevolution is called supraspecific evolution (Rensch 1959, see Hennig 1966: 223-225). There are various views of the dynamics of macroevolution.\nMacroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation.\nMicroevolution can be contrasted with macroevolution, which is the occurrence of large-scale changes in gene frequencies in a population over a geological time period (i.e. consisting of either rapid or extended microevolution).\nWhat scientists can do is compare the results of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural experiments\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as seen in fossils and modern organisms, and make inferences from them.
