As soon as the legal problems were solved, Geissler started a year-long pre-production working with conceptual artist Ludwig Angerer, to ensure the film's design and technical ambitions would fit into a lower budget, along with averting the problems the first movie faced with its effects. Geissler also hired screenwriter Karin Howard, who contributed 14 drafts until the final screenplay, which draws inspiration from most chapters in the second half of Ende's novel. Geissler opted to invite a director only when the development was finished, as he considered effects-heavy productions \"burn a director out real fast when they're in on a picture from the earliest pre-production  stages.

As labour rules regarding child actors limited their working schedules, Miller decided to only rehearse scenes once before filming, and maximized the time with the children on set by shooting with as many as three cameras on every scene. This created a problem as Miller's fear of falling late wound making the film so ahead of schedule the effects team had not completed the necessary work for later scenes.\nThe Neverending Story: The Animated Adventures of Bastian Balthazar Bux is an  animated television series , produced by  CineVox  (Germany),  Ellipse  (France), and  Nelvana  (Canada), aired for one season (1995\u20131996) on  HBO , ran for 26 episodes, and loosely based on  Michael Ende 's book,  The Neverending Story  (1979).\nThe NeverEnding Story  was the first film adaptation of the novel.
