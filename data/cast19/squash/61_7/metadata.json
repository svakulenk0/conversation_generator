{"input_text": "Watching cartoons helps bring your imagination to life and create comedy or hope for mainly children but also adults. An example of a cartoon and comic that does this is The  Justice League  is a fictional superhero group in the  DC Universe  formed to protect Mankind from any threats to their safety. The groups primary members consist of  Batman ,  Superman ,  Green Lantern ,  Wonder Woman ,  Martian Manhunter ,  The Flash , and  Aquaman  but throughout the years the group has expanded its team spreading its belief and movement to heroes around the world to join and fight for what they believe. The Justice League stands for hope for people, and will risk their lives to protect the earth and its inhabitance against all evil, an example of the justice leagues enemies are known as the Injustice league. Many of these heroes have a team that follows their crusade.\nWith DC's history rewritten due to the  Flashpoint  limited series, an entirely new origin for the Justice League appeared in the subsequent Justice League series which debuted with an October 2011 cover date as part of the company-wide event,  The New 52 . Issue #1 portrayed the first meeting between Batman and Hal Jordan, with the two encountering each other during a battle against a  Parademon  in Gotham City. After realizing the creature is  extraterrestrial  in origin, the two heroes head to Metropolis to seek out Superman only to be attacked by him. Later, after a brief fight in which the Flash arrives and Batman convinces Superman they are on the same side, they move to an abandoned building to work on analyzing a  mysterious alien box , when it suddenly activates and more Parademons arrive. While fighting the Parademons,  Aquaman  and  Wonder Woman  appear and join forces with the other heroes. The mysterious box leads to  Darkseid 's arrival on Earth, and the heroes come together, along with the newcomer  Cyborg , to defeat him. The public becomes enamored with the heroes, and a writer dubs the group the 'Justice League', following the Flash's suggestion of 'Super Seven'.\nIn \"Secret Origins\", the  Martian Manhunter  gathers the future League to battle against an alien invasion on Earth. After the defeat of the invasion, the seven remained a team and officially formed the Justice League, dedicated to the defense of Earth against attack both within and without. To the rest of the League, Shayera was a mysterious woman with angelic wings from another world. She explained that she found herself on Earth when, while pursuing some criminals who were trafficking in forbidden technology, she was accidentally transported by the rays of a dimensional transporter known to her people as a Zeta Beam, which has been traditionally associated with DC's science fiction hero  Adam Strange .\nAnother of Fox's major achievements was his revival of the concept of the  Justice Society  as the  Justice League of America , debuting in the comic book  The Brave and the Bold  #28 (Feb.-Mar. 1960). Soon given their own title during Oct.-Nov. 1960, the Justice League would become the basis of the DC Universe. The supervillain  Doctor Light  first battled the team in issue #12 (June 1962). Justice League of America #21 and #22 (August\u2013September 1963) featured the first team-up of the Justice League and the  Justice Society of America  as well as the first use of the term \" Crisis \" in reference to a crossover between characters. The next year's team-up with the Justice Society introduced the threat of the  Crime Syndicate of America  of  Earth-Three . The character  Zatanna , introduced by Fox and artist Murphy Anderson in Hawkman #4 (Nov. 1964), was the center of a plotline which ran through several DC titles and was resolved in Justice League of America #51 (Feb. 1967). Fox and Sekowsky were the creative team for the title's first eight years. Sekowsky's last issue was #63 (June 1968) and Fox departed with #65 (September 1968).\nAccording to animator  Bruce Timm , the  series finale  of  Justice League , \"Starcrossed\", was originally planned to be the final episode of the series; however,  Cartoon Network  ordered the production of a successor, entitled Justice League Unlimited. Taking place shortly after  its predecessor  ended, it features a greatly expanded League, in which the characters from the original series\u2014now referred to as \"founding members\"\u2014are joined by many other  superheroes  from the  DC Universe ; in the first episode, well over 50 characters appear. A number of these were heroes who had made guest appearances in  Justice League , but many heroes and other characters made their first animated appearances in this series. The general format of each episode is to have a small team assemble to deal with a particular situation, with a focus on both action and character interaction. This extension of the  Justice League  was originally planned to be explained in a  planned direct-to-video feature film , but the project never materialized.\n[[File:JLI.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Justice League gets a larger roster as seen in Justice League International (vol. 1) #24 (Feb, 1989). Art by  Kevin Maguire .]]The release of Justice League Spectacular launched the revised Justice League titles under new writers and artists. The Justice League titles expanded to a total of four by the early to mid-1990s: Justice League America (formerly Justice League International),  Justice League Europe  (which had started two years after Justice League launched, spinning from #24),  Justice League Task Force ,  Extreme Justice  and Justice League Quarterly. Justice League Europe was later retitled to become the second volume of Justice League International.\nJustice League: War is a  direct-to-video  animated  superhero film  featuring the  DC Comics  superhero team the  Justice League , and an adaptation of the story Justice League: Origin by  Geoff Johns  and  Jim Lee , the first story in DC's  2011 DC Universe relaunch . It was directed by  Jay Oliva , scripted by Heath Corson. It is the first movie from the  DC Universe Animated Original Movies  series that is part of a new shared continuity, the  DC Animated Movie Universe . The film was released for downloading on January 21, 2014 and was released on  Blu-ray  and  DVD  formats on February 4, 2014. It had its world premiere at the  Paley Center for Media  on the same day. On August 11, 2015, Warner Home Video re-released the film on a combo pack, which includes a DVD and Blu-Ray copy, a digital copy, and the graphic novel it's based on.\nJustice League: Cry for Justice is a seven-issue  comic book   limited series , written by  James Robinson , drawn by Mauro Cascioli, and published by  DC Comics  in 2009. It follows the adventures of a spin-off  Justice League , led by Justice League veterans  Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)  and  Green Arrow , and composed of  Starman (Mikaal Tomas) ,  Congorilla ,  Freddy Freeman , the  Atom (Ray Palmer) , and  Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) . They are seeking a more proactive stand for seeking justice following the apparent deaths of long-standing Justice League members  Batman  and  Martian Manhunter  during the  Final Crisis  event.\nThe team is an assemblage of superheroes who join together as the Justice League. The seven original members were  Batman ,  Aquaman ,  the Flash ,  Green Lantern ,  Martian Manhunter ,  Superman , and  Wonder Woman . The team roster has rotated throughout the years, consisting of many superheroes from the  DC Universe  like  Atom ,  Black Canary ,  Captain Marvel ,  Green Arrow ,  Hawkman , and  Plastic Man .The Justice League received its own comic book title called Justice League of America in November 1960. With the  2011 relaunch  of its titles, DC Comics released a second volume of Justice League. In July 2016, the  DC Rebirth  initiative relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of Justice League. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various television programs and video games and is set to appear in the  live action film of the same name .\nThe  Justice League , also called the Justice League of America or JLA, is a  fiction al  superhero  team that appears in  comic book s published by  DC Comics . Since their first appearance in  The Brave and the Bold  #28 (February/March 1960), various incarnations of the team have appeared in film, television, and video game adaptations.\nAt the end of \"Secret Origins,\" the premiere three-episode arc of Justice League, Superman proposes the formation of a superhero coalition including himself, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash (Wally West), the Green Lantern (John Stewart), the Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl. In a direct reference (and perhaps a criticism of the somewhat silly name), the Flash jokingly asks if such a team would be called \"Super Friends.\" Superman relabels the guild as the \"Justice League.\"\nThe origins of  The Flash ,  Green Lantern ,  Martian Manhunter ,  Aquaman ,  Green Arrow  &  Black Canary ,  Plastic Man ,  Hawkman , and  Hawkgirl , along with the origins of the other four super-heroes presented in the previous one-shots, are all told, ending with the origin of how Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter, followed by Superman & Batman, formed the  Justice League of America .\nThe Justice League is a fictional group of  superhero es on the  television series ,  Smallville , who were adapted for television by  Alfred Gough  and  Miles Millar . The Justice League originally included Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone, and Arthur Curry; Clark Kent did not accept a role until three seasons later. As the team continued to appear in the series, new characters were introduced and subsequently joined the team. The  original Justice League  first appeared in the  DC comic book   The Brave and the Bold  #28 (1960), and consisted of members  Superman ,  Batman ,  Wonder Woman ,  Flash ,  Green Lantern ,  Aquaman , and the  Martian Manhunter . In Smallville, the team did not make its first official appearance until the  season six  episode \"Justice\", although each member had been previously introduced individually on various episodes since  season four . In the series, the team never formalized a name for themselves, although the cast and crew officially recognized the team as the \"Justice League\".\nSecret Origins  (vol. 2) #32 (November 1988) updated Justice League of America #9's origin for post-Crisis continuity. Differences included the inclusion of the Silver Age  Black Canary  as a founding member and the absence of Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman. The JLA: Year One  limited series , by  Mark Waid ,  Brian Augustyn  and  Barry Kitson , further expanded the Secret Origins depiction.\nAfter the 12-issue  limited series  Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics  retconned  the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline \" Year One \" from Batman #404\u2013407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called  Legends of the Dark Knight  in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period.\nThe fact that DC Comics characters coexisted in the same world was first established in  All Star Comics  #3 (1940) where several superheroes (who starred in separate stories in the series up to that point) met each other in a group dubbed the  Justice Society of America .  Subsequently, the Justice Society was reintroduced as the  Justice League  of America, which was founded with Major League Baseball's National League and American League as inspiration for the name. The comic book that introduced the Justice League was titled  The Brave and the Bold  However, the majority of National/DC's publications continued to be written with little regard of maintaining continuity with each other for the first few decades.\nIn Justice League of America, the Martian Manhunter is a member of the US government-sponsored Justice League, taking orders from  Amanda Waller  and  Steve Trevor . Like other members of the team, he has been selected as a counterpart for a member of the independent Justice League, should they ever go rogue; J'onn is Superman's counterpart. He also appears in Justice League; when  Despero  assaults the Watchtower, he is mentioned by  Firestorm  as having been a member of the Justice League when it initially fought with Despero. When Despero incapacitates Firestorm,  Element Woman , and  the Atom , Martian Manhunter appears and defeats him with a telepathic assault. Working with his JLA colleagues in Justice League of America, he investigates the activities of the  Secret Society of Super Villains , led by  the Outsider . Later, the two leagues meet, along with the supernaturally powered  Justice League Dark  in the \" Trinity War \" crossover storyline because of a diplomatic crisis in  Khandaq  triggered by the young superhero  Shazam . The three leagues are gathered together when the Outsider reveals himself to be an evil counterpart of Batman's butler  Alfred Pennyworth , from  Earth-Three , and witnesses the arrival of Earth-Three's evil Justice League's counterparts, the  Crime Syndicate . The three leagues are roundly defeated, and the Martian Manhunter is trapped inside the Firestorm matrix along with his colleagues by Firestorm's evil counterpart Deathstorm. While inside Firestorm, for the duration of the Forever Evil-themed issues of the Justice League of America title, Manhunter and  Stargirl  shared a close adventure interlinked with one another's memories as Despero assisted the Syndicate with keeping the JLA imprisoned. After being freed in Forever Evil #7, the two remain close friends, and along with Green Arrow go on to form the core of a new successor Justice League based out of Canada, in  Justice League United .\nIn the 1985-1986  crossover  \" Crisis on Infinite Earths \", DC Comics rebooted its fictional universe and the back-stories of nearly all its characters. This required retellings of many of  origin stories , including that of the Justice League of America. The first adventures of the Justice League, and that of Snapper Carr, were retold in the 12-issue  maxi-series  comic book JLA: Year One. The first several issues of the maxi-series involved the alien race known as the  Appellaxian s, which had first appeared in Justice League of America Vol. 1 #9 (February 1962). In the fictional character chronology, this story occurs before and shortly after The Brave and the Bold #28, but in the publication history of the character it is printed in 1998. In the story, the Appellaxians conspired with a new criminal organization,  Locus , to take over Earth. Snapper's uncle, Simon Carr, made his first appearance in the second issue, and in the third issue readers learned that Simon is the contact person for an ultra-wealthy individual (later revealed to be  Oliver Queen ) who wishes to financially support the Justice League in its mission. Simon introduced the League to college student and genius inventor  Ted Kord  (who is also the superhero  Blue Beetle ), who provided them with some technology, and to his nephew, Snapper. The adventure with Starro took place between JLA: Year One issues #3 and #4, and Snapper played a critical role in issue #9 in alerting the League to the Appellaxian attack on Earth. In issue #10, he deduced that his uncle had been possessed by the Appellaxian leader, and had the League defeat Simon and then free him from alien control.\nJustice League Task Force was an American monthly  comic book  series published by  DC Comics  from June  1993  to August  1996 ; it lasted 37 issues. At the time the  Justice League  was featured in three separate series:  Justice League America ,  Justice League Europe  (JLE) and  Justice League Quarterly  (JLQ). Justice League Task Force was a spinoff of Justice League Europe, a series which ran from April 1989 to May 1993. Like JLE, this team carried a  United Nations  charter which sanctioned their activities. In fact, JLTF was composed of several former JLE members. The team was called to action by Hannibal Martin, a representative of the  U.N. . He asked that  Martian Manhunter  select a \"strike team\" of fellow Justice League members and to \"lead them on a very special mission\".\nThe first storyline takes place five years in the past and details the retconned origin of the original Justice League in  The New 52 , a reboot of the DC Comics universe. In an origin story it is revealed that hero  Victor Stone  was uploaded with Ivo's \"A-maze\" operating system among other features. The League later battle the android.\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in  World's Finest Comics , starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the  Justice League of America , Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's  Brave and the Bold  #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different  DC Universe  superhero each month.\nThe cancellation of Justice League International led into the launch of a new Justice League of America title (volume 3). The new Justice League of America is entirely separate from the main Justice League as the new team was formed by  Amanda Waller  and consists of  Steve Trevor ,  Martian Manhunter ,  Green Arrow ,  Hawkman ,  Catwoman , the new  Green Lantern   Simon Baz ,  Stargirl ,  Katana  and  Vibe . Katana and Vibe later received their own ongoing titles, although both were cancelled after 10 issues. The new  Atom , Rhonda Pineda, is also a member of the Justice League of America. She works as a spy to gain intel on the Justice League, reporting to Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor. It is later revealed that, unknown to the members of either team, she is actually a member of Earth-3's Crime Syndicate, and is betraying both teams. Each member of the Justice League of America is intended to be a counterpart to the members of the Justice League, in case the Justice League would ever go rogue. Catwoman and Green Arrow both serve as counterparts for Batman.\nIn  Infinite Crisis  #7 (June 2006), the formation of \"New Earth\" (the new name for the post-Crisis Earth) restored Wonder Woman as a founding member of the Justice League. In Brad Meltzer's Justice League of America (vol. 2) #0 (September 2006), it was revealed that Superman and Batman were again founding members as well.  52  #51 (June 2007) confirmed that the 1989 Secret Origins and JLA: Year One origins were still in continuity at that time, with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman joining the team with founding members' status shortly after the group's formation with Aquaman, Black Canary, Flash, Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter. In Justice League of America #12 (October 2007), the founding members of the Justice League were shown to be Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter.\nSome issues of the second series were collected in a  trade paperback  along with other material and some original work in 1989, Secret Origins, but the official title as stated in the book's  indicia  is given as Secret Origins Of The World's Greatest Super-Heroes (ISBN 0930289501). The focus was on DC's major characters: origin of the Justice League team (#32), the Flash (Barry Allen, from Secret Origins Annual #2); Green Lantern (Hal Jordan, from #36); J'onn J'onnz, the Martian Manhunter (from #35); and Superman (from The Man of Steel #6). There was also an all-new retelling of Batman's origins,  Batman: The Man Who Falls , by Dennis O'Neil and  Dick Giordano ; this story later served as a cited inspiration for the  2005 film   Batman Begins .\nStarbreaker debuted in a three-part storyline  Justice League of America  #96-98 (Feb.-May 1972). The first chapter, \"The Coming of Starbreaker\" introduced the foe, while the second, \"The Day the Earth Screams\", also featured the  origin story  of the Justice League. In the third tale, \"No More Tomorrows\",  Sargon the Sorcerer  helps the League defeat Starbreaker.\nThe Justice League, formerly known as the Justice League of America (JLA), is a fictional international  superhero  team appearing in  American comic book s published by  DC Comics . The Justice League was conceived by writer  Gardner Fox , and first appeared in  The Brave and the Bold  #28 (March 1960).\n1 Traditionally, the founding members of the Justice League include Aquaman, Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Superman and Wonder Woman. 2  In this new canon, Martian Manhunter is instead a member of StormWatch.\n91,495 pages on this wiki.
