{"version": "squash-2.0", "data": [{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Social conflict  is the struggle between segments of society over valued resources. From the perspective of social conflict theory, in the West, by the nineteenth century, a small population had become capitalists. Capitalists are people who own and operate factories and other businesses in pursuit of profits. In other words, they own virtually all large-scale means of production. However, capitalism turned most other people into industrial workers, whom Marx called proletarians. Proletarians are people who, because of the structure of capitalist economy, must sell their labor for wages. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class, gender and race conflict, and contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro level analysis of society that sees society as an arena of inequality that generates conflict and social change. Karl Marx is the father of the  social conflict theory, which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology. Other important sociologists associated with this theory include Harriet Martineau, Jane Addams and W.E.B. Du Bois. This sociological approach doesn't look at how social structures help society to operate, but instead looks at how \"social patterns\" can cause some people in society to be dominant, and others to be oppressed. However, some criticisms to this theory are that it disregards how shared values and the way in which people rely on each other help to unify the society.", "qas": [{"id": "question_0", "question": "What does social conflict theory deal with?", "answers": [{"text": "Social conflict  is the struggle between segments of society over valued resources.", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1", "question": "what is social conflict theory?", "answers": [{"text": "From the perspective of social conflict theory, in the West, by the nineteenth century, a small population had become capitalists.", "answer_start": 84}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_2", "question": "What are they?", "answers": [{"text": "Capitalists are people who own and operate factories and other businesses in pursuit of profits.", "answer_start": 215}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_3", "question": "How are social conflicts related to capitalism?", "answers": [{"text": "In other words, they own virtually all large-scale means of production.", "answer_start": 312}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_4", "question": "What did this turn into", "answers": [{"text": "However, capitalism turned most other people into industrial workers, whom Marx called proletarians.", "answer_start": 384}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_5", "question": "What does this mean?", "answers": [{"text": "Proletarians are people who, because of the structure of capitalist economy, must sell their labor for wages.", "answer_start": 485}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_6", "question": "What does this theory do", "answers": [{"text": "Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class, gender and race conflict, and contrast historically dominant ideologies.", "answer_start": 595}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_7", "question": "How is social conflict theory related to social change?", "answers": [{"text": "It is therefore a macro level analysis of society that sees society as an arena of inequality that generates conflict and social change.", "answer_start": 740}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_8", "question": "what is the social conflict theory?", "answers": [{"text": "Karl Marx is the father of the  social conflict theory, which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology.", "answer_start": 877}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_9", "question": "Who is Harriet Martineau?", "answers": [{"text": "Other important sociologists associated with this theory include Harriet Martineau, Jane Addams and W.E.B.

constant struggle for power and resources. Many people view substance abuse as a problem of socioeconomic inequality and class conflict. Many people also believe that minorities are charged higher penalties for drug possession. The power struggle is evident in which powder cocaine is a lesser charge then being caught with having street cocaine. In this situation the higher class would be able to buy the powder cocaine and if caught would not get as harsh of a punishment. In cases like this the minority or poor social class would receive the harsher punishment. Since many jails are privately owned the state has to arrest a certain amount of individuals and fill in beds in the prisons. This perceptive illustrates the power struggle individuals face with social economic inequality and how minorities don't have the same power and economic stability that those of the higher class have. The symbolic interaction perceptive views society as the sum of all personal interactions based on their interpretation of meaning. Native Americans use  psilocybin mushrooms, which are commonly known as magic mushrooms. Native Americans use them for religious and spiritual purposes. In this case the drug has religious and therapeutic meaning. The Native American meaning to this drug differs to those of other drugs like marijuana because the drug has spiritual meaning to them. Many countries use drugs like these for purposes that is important to their culture and religion. Symbolic interaction is evident in labeling theory and how individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels, and over time this forms the basis of their self-identity and it is through the social process of labeling that we create deviance by assigning shared meanings to other acts. To show the process of becoming deviant a study was taken by Howard Beck called \"Becoming a Marihuanna User\" and began his study with a simple question: are marijuana users different from nonusers? Becker argues that chronic marijuana use results from a process of social learning and before people light up, they must first learn how to smoke. For some, smoking marijuana is fun and enjoyable. The shared meaning is different for everyone. The structural functionalist theory views society as a machine whose parts must be working together. In this case the way the criminal system works with the privately owned jail system. The state has to arrest and incarcerate a certain amount of people in order to fill the space in prisons.", "qas": [{"id": "question_85", "question": "What does social conflict theory view society

This new system of capitalism, which he identifies as postcapitalism, is characterised by diverse class structure and a fluid system of power relations. Thus, it involves a much more complex system of inequality than Marx originally outlined. Dahrendorf contends that postcapitalist society has institutionalised class conflict into state and economic spheres.
