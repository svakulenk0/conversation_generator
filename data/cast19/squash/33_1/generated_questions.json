that he have a say in any future film treatments of his work. As soon as the legal problems were solved, Geissler started a year-long pre-production working with conceptual artist Ludwig Angerer, to ensure the film's design and technical ambitions would fit into a lower budget, along with averting the problems the first movie faced with its effects. Geissler also hired screenwriter Karin Howard, who contributed 14 drafts until the final screenplay, which draws inspiration from most chapters in the second half of Ende's novel. Geissler opted to invite a director only when the development was finished, as he considered effects-heavy productions \"burn a director out real fast when they're in on a picture from the earliest pre-production  stages. What I wanted was for the director to come in fresh and not already worn out and to be able to put his ideas on an already solid structure.\" He eventually brought in the American  George T.
