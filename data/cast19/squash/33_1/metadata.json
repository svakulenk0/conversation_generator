He, and other dual-natured creatures like him, is able to travel between worlds, changing into a Fantastican or a human depending upon the world, in appearance only. Atreyu finally meets Gmork in Spook City, where he is chained, and Atreyu employs the name 'Nobody' to hide his identity in shame of his failure to complete his quest. Gmork confesses that he has been hunting a boy sent on a quest by the Childlike Empress to find her a new name, but lost him early on. He then met the Princess of Darkness, Gaya, who upon hearing of his mission to help the Nothing, chained Gmork with an unbreakable chain (reminiscent of  Fenrir  in  Nordic mythology ) and leapt into the Nothing, leaving him to starve. Gmork explains to Atreyu the nature of the Nothing, and that a Fantastican who enters it, must become a ' lie ' in the human world. Eventually, Gmork reveals the name of the boy he is pursuing, and Atreyu reveals his identity, which causes Gmork to laugh until he finally succumbs to starvation. As Atreyu approaches the dead wolf, the carcass grabs Atreyu in its jaws, which prevents Atreyu obedience to the overpowering urge exerted by the Nothing to throw himself into it. He is freed from Gmork's grip by Falkor, who escapes with him to the Ivory Tower.\nDamon has produced or executive produced over 70 films, and his films have received 10 Oscar nominations including: the 2005  Academy Award  winner  Monster , starring  Charlize Theron ; the critically acclaimed, multi-Oscar nominated  World War II drama   Das Boot , directed by  Wolfgang Petersen ; and  The NeverEnding Story , also directed by Wolfgang Petersen.

As soon as the legal problems were solved, Geissler started a year-long pre-production working with conceptual artist Ludwig Angerer, to ensure the film's design and technical ambitions would fit into a lower budget, along with averting the problems the first movie faced with its effects. Geissler also hired screenwriter Karin Howard, who contributed 14 drafts until the final screenplay, which draws inspiration from most chapters in the second half of Ende's novel. Geissler opted to invite a director only when the development was finished, as he considered effects-heavy productions \"burn a director out real fast when they're in on a picture from the earliest pre-production  stages. What I wanted was for the director to come in fresh and not already worn out and to be able to put his ideas on an already solid structure.\" He eventually brought in the American  George T. Miller , who was a fan of the original film. Over 600 children were auditioned, given the original actors were too old for their roles. In contrast to The NeverEnding Story relying on  blue screen  and scale model creatures, The Next Chapter would have more life-sized model work and  matte painting s. Principal photography begun in early 1990 at  Bavaria Film  near  Munich . The original plan was to build three separate stages, having first and  second unit  shooting simultaneously on the first two stage and have the effects done on the third. But the studio decided not to build the third stage at the last minute, forcing production to shoot first and second unit on the same stage at the same time. As labour rules regarding child actors limited their working schedules, Miller decided to only rehearse scenes once before filming, and maximized the time with the children on set by shooting with as many as three cameras on every scene. This created a problem as Miller's fear of falling late wound making the film so ahead of schedule the effects team had not completed the necessary work for later scenes.\nBarret Spencer Oliver (born August 24, 1973) is an American photographer and former child actor. He is known for his role as Bastian Balthazar Bux in the  film adaptation  of  Michael Ende 's novel  The NeverEnding Story , followed by roles in  D.A.R.Y.L. ,  Cocoon  and  Cocoon: The Return .\nThe NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter is a 1990 German-American  fantasy film  and sequel to  The NeverEnding Story .

It covered only the first half of the book, ending at the point where Bastian enters Fantasia (Fantastica). Ende, who was reportedly \"revolted\" by the movie, requested they halt production or change the movie's name, as he felt it had drastically deviated from his novel; when they did neither, he sued them and subsequently lost the case.

Some electronic tracks by  Giorgio Moroder  were added to the US version of the movie, as well as the titlesong Never Ending Story composed by  Giorgio Moroder  and  Keith Forsey  becoming a chart success for  Limahl , the former singer of  Kajagoogoo .\nDeparting from the canon of the 1979 novel The Neverending Story by Michael Ende, the overall story in the series explored the  origin story  of how Bastian discovers Fantasia from an even greater  point of divergence  from Michael Ende's novel than the 1984 and 1990 Warner Brothers films had previously depicted.\nThe film was produced by  Bernd Eichinger  and Dieter Giessler and directed and co-written by  Wolfgang Petersen  (his first English-language film) and starred  Barret Oliver ,  Noah Hathaway ,  Tami Stronach ,  Moses Gunn ,  Thomas Hill ; and  Alan Oppenheimer  as the voices of both  Falkor  and  Gmork  ( as well as other characters ). At the time of its release, it was the most expensive film produced outside the  United States  or the  Soviet Union . The film was the first in  The NeverEnding Story film series  and later followed by two  sequel s.\nLee is quoted to say that \"fantasy is better when read as fantasy.\" He explains this in a  Naver  interview that \"treating  The Lord of the Rings  as a shoddy  allegory  to reality and reading it as an example of [|Orientalism]] literature where  Gandalf  the 'White' crowns the returned  king of the 'West' , would leave a lot of the novels to be missed. (If you admit such, almost outrageous logic, because humanity becomes extincts many times  Kurt Vonnegut  would be anti-humanism, sadly.)\" He explained \"fantasy is fantasy, and not the reality's narrow allegories or scary  simulacra ; it is neither reality in disguise nor does it expel the reality and take its place.\" Lee described reading fantasy as \"going into fantasy to gain something, or to give something, and we simply return to the reality\" giving  Michael Ende 's  The Neverending Story  as a great example for this. Lee also says being \"fantastic\" has little to do with the quality of a fantasy work.\nThe  film score  of The NeverEnding Story was composed by  Klaus Doldinger  of the German jazz group  Passport . The  theme song of the North American release  of the film was composed by  Giorgio Moroder  with lyrics by  Keith Forsey , and performed by  Limahl  (lead singer of  Kajagoogoo ) and  Beth Anderson .

He was nominated for two  Academy Awards  for the 1981  World War II   submarine  warfare film  Das Boot  (1981).

Other notable film-makers who came to prominence in the 1980s include producer  Bernd Eichinger  and directors  Doris D\u00f6rrie ,  Uli Edel , and  Loriot .\nAs in his well-known work  The Neverending Story , Michael Ende uses fantasy and symbolism to deal with real world matters such as the nature and importance of time, the power of stories, friendship, compassion and the value of the small but pleasant things that make life more worth living.\nStronach made her acting debut as \" The Childlike Empress \" in  The Neverending Story  (1984), a film adaptation of the novel  Die Unendliche Geschichte (The Neverending Story)  by  Michael Ende .
