{"input_text": "\"Altruria\" derives from the  Latin  alter \"the other\". As opposed to  egotism ,  altruism \u2014a word coined during the first half of the 19th century by  Auguste Comte \u2014is unselfish concern for the welfare of others. Thus, Altruria is a Utopian country inhabited exclusively by altruists, by people who believe that they have a moral obligation to help, serve, or benefit others, if necessary by the sacrifice of  self interest .\nHerbert Spencer  (1820\u20131903), the English philosopher, was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the  Darwinian revolution  in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before  Darwin  published anything on the subject. Encouraged by his friend and follower  Edward L. Youmans , Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term \"sociology\" in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal  International Monthly ,  Franklin H. Giddings  (1855\u20131931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that \"first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest\" in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States,  Charles Horton Cooley , stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology \"probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since.\" It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including  \u00c9mile Durkheim , defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim\u2019s  Division of Labour in Society  is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable  biologist , Spencer coined the term \" survival of the fittest \" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a  laissez-faire  style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the  United States  and  England . Although Spencer's work is rarely discussed in contemporary sociological theory, his work has been adapted and changed, and resurfaces in various contemporary forms.\nAuguste Comte , the \"Father of Positivism\", pointed out the need to keep society unified as many traditions were diminishing. He was the first person to coin the term sociology. Auguste Comte suggests that sociology is the product of a three-stage development.\nA General View of Positivism (Discours sur l'ensemble du positivisme) was an 1848 book by the French philosopher  Auguste Comte , first published in English in 1865. A founding text in the development of  positivism  and the discipline of  sociology , the work provides a revised and full account of the theory Comte presented earlier in his multi-part  The Course in Positive Philosophy  (1830\u20131842). Comte outlines the epistemological view of positivism, provides an account of the manner by which sociology should be performed, and describes his  law of three stages .\nComte's death in 1858 freed Littr\u00e9 from any fear of alienating his master. He published his own ideas in his Paroles de la philosophie positive in 1859. Four years later, in a work of greater length, he published Auguste Comte et la philosophie positive, which traces the origin of Comte's ideas through  Turgot ,  Kant , and Saint-Simon. The work eulogises Comte's own life, his method of philosophy, his great services to the cause and the effect of his works, and proceeds to show where he himself differs from him. He approved wholly of Comte's philosophy, his great laws of society and his philosophical method, which indeed he defended warmly against  John Stuart Mill . However, he stated that, while he believed in a positivist philosophy, he did not believe in a \"religion of humanity\".\nThe main antecedent of legal positivism is  Empiricism , whose thinkers range back as far as  Sextus Empiricus ,  John Locke ,  George Berkeley ,  David Hume , and  Auguste Comte . Central to the empiricism is the claim that all knowledge of fact must be validated by sense experience or be inferred from propositions derived unambiguously from sense data. Further, empiricism stands in opposition to metaphysics; for instance, Hume rejected metaphysics as mere speculation beyond what can be learnt from sense experience. The teachings of the empiricists acted as a harbinger for a systematic version of a positivist approach to problems of comprehension and analysis, which was later mirrored in legal positivism.\nThe  Positivist calendar  (1849), created by  Auguste Comte , was based on a 364-day year which included one or two \u201cblank\u201d days. Each of the 13 months had 28 days and exactly four weeks, and each started on a Monday. The  International Fixed Calendar  is a more modern descendant of this calendar.\nPeirce agreed with  Auguste Comte  in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce  classified  mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the  real numbers ) and continua. Influenced by his father  Benjamin , Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.\nScientific politics was a late 19th-century  political theory  based on the  positivist   philosophy  of  Auguste Comte . Proponents of scientific politics advocated a society and political system that was to be organized in accordance with the laws of nature.\nA course entitled \"sociology\" was taught for the first time in the United States in 1875 by  William Graham Sumner , drawing upon the thought of Comte and  Herbert Spencer  rather than the work of Durkheim. In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the  University of Kansas , lectured by  Frank Blackmar . The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 and the first full-fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the  University of Chicago  by  Albion W. Small  (1854\u20131926), who in 1895 founded the  American Journal of Sociology . American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology.  George Herbert Mead  and  Charles H. Cooley  were influential in the development of  symbolic interactionism  and  social psychology  at the University of Chicago, while  Lester Ward  emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883.\nBenjamin Constant Botelho de Magalh\u00e3es (18 October 1836 \u2013 22 January 1891) was a  Brazil ian military man and political thinker.  Primarily a positivist, influenced heavily by  Auguste Comte , he was the founder of the  positivist  movement in Brazil ( Sociedade Positivista do Brasil , Brazilian Positivist Society), and later this led to his  republican  views. He left the Brazilian Positivist society because of internal disagreements, but remained an ardent pupil of Comte until the end of his life.\nSaint-Simon and his secretary  Auguste Comte  developed what Comte would complete as  sociology .\nAuguste Comte  (1798\u20131857) was a philosopher born in  Montpellier . He was the founder of the discipline of  sociology  and the doctrine of  positivism , and may be regarded as the first  philosopher of science  in the modern sense of the term.\nThe Tranquility  Calendar  is a  solar calendar  proposal for  calendar reform  proposed by Jeff Siggins in 1989. It is a derivative of the  International Fixed Calendar  as well as the earlier  Positivist Calendar  published in 1849 by French philosopher  Auguste Comte  (1798\u20131857), providing for a year of 13 months of 28 days each, with one day at the end of each year belonging to no month or week, and a leap day approximately every 4 years.\nGeschichte der Reaktion (History of Reaction) was published in two volumes in 1851 by Allgemeine Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt and immediately banned in Austria. It was written in the context of the recent  1848 revolutions in German states  and is mainly a collection of the works of others selected and translated by Stirner. The introduction and some additional passages were Stirner's work.  Edmund Burke  and  Auguste Comte  are quoted to show two opposing views of  revolution .\nThe Course in Positive Philosophy (Cours de Philosophie Positive) was a series of texts written by the French  philosopher of science  and founding  sociologist ,  Auguste Comte , between 1830 and 1842. Within the work he unveiled the  epistemological  perspective of  positivism . The works were translated into English by  Harriet Martineau  and condensed to form The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (1853).\nMost of the 19th century pioneers of social theory and sociology, like Saint-Simon, Comte, Marx,  John Stuart Mill  or Spencer, never held university posts. In this sense they were broadly regarded as philosophers. Emile Durkheim, however, endeavoured to formally established academic sociology, and did so at the  University of Bordeaux  in 1895, publishing his  Rules of the Sociological Method . In 1896, he established the journal  L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique . Durkheim's seminal monograph,  Suicide  (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst  Catholic  and  Protestant  populations, distinguished sociological analysis from  psychology  or  philosophy .\nThe first \"modern\" social theories (known as classical theories) that begin to resemble the analytic social theory of today developed almost simultaneously with the birth of the science of sociology.  Auguste Comte  (1798\u20131857), known as the \"father of sociology\" and regarded by some as the first philosopher of science, laid the groundwork for  positivism  \u2013 as well as  structural functionalism  and  social evolutionism . In the 19th century three great classical theories of social and historical change emerged: the  social evolutionism  theory (of which  Social Darwinism  forms a part), the  social cycle theory  and the  Marxist   historical materialism  theory.\nLacassagne shared with  Paul Dubuisson , the co-founder of the Archives d'anthropologie criminelle, and  Joseph Gouzer  a common admiration for  Franz Joseph Gall  (1758\u20131828), the founder of  phrenology . He was also influenced by  Auguste Comte 's  positivism , beginning one of his article by a quote from  Michelet  which claimed that \"Science of justice and science of nature are one.\"  Lyon  had in fact been an important center for phrenology, with the presence of  Fleury Imbert  (1796\u20131851), a disciple of  Fourier  who married Gall's widow, and  \u00c9mile Gromier  (1811\u201378), who preceded Lacassagne in the Lyon Faculty. A third, important influence of Lacassagne was  hygienism . From these influences, he retained two main principles:  organicism  and  cerebral localisations .\nIn later life, Auguste Comte developed a 'religion of humanity' to give positivist societies the unity and cohesiveness found through the traditional worship people were used to.  In this new \"religion\" he referred to society as the \"Great Being.\" Comte promoted a universal love and harmony taught through the teachings of his industrial system theory. For close associate  John Stuart Mill , it was possible to distinguish between a \"good Comte\" (the author of the Course in Positive Philosophy) and a \"bad Comte\" (the author of the secular-religious system). The system was unsuccessful but met with the publication of  Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species  to influence the proliferation of various  Secular Humanist  organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as  George Holyoake  and  Richard Congreve .\nWhen the Archbishop of York thought this 'new philosophy' was based on  Auguste Comte 's  positivism , Huxley corrected him: \"Comte's philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity\" (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays Methods & Results 156). A later version was \"[positivism is] sheer Popery with M. Comte in the chair of St Peter, and with the names of the saints changed\". (lecture on ''The scientific aspects of positivism'' Huxley 1870 Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews p149). Huxley's dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte's ideas withered in Britain.\nAuguste Comte, known as \"the father of sociology\", formulated the  law of three stages : human development progresses from the  theological  stage, in which nature was  myth ically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings; through a  metaphysical stage  in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them; until the final  positive  stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and through increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of the world. Comte saw the science-valuing society as the highest, most developed type of human organization.\nSociology was established by Comte in 1838. He had earlier used the term \"social physics\", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician  Adolphe Quetelet . Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the  French Revolution , he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological  positivism , an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy [1830\u20131842] and  A General View of Positivism  (1844). Comte believed a  positivist stage  would mark the final era, after conjectural  theological  and  metaphysical  phases, in the progression of human understanding.\nSociologist have studied religion right from the beginning of the discipline, in the 19th century. It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as Comte, Karl Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can\u2019t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002).\nWriting after the original  enlightenment  and influenced by the work of Saint-Simon,  political philosopher  of  social contract ,  Auguste Comte  hoped to unify all studies of humankind through the scientific understanding of the social realm. His own sociological scheme was typical of the 19th century humanists; he believed all human life passed through distinct historical stages and that, if one could grasp this progress, one could prescribe the remedies for social ills. Sociology was to be the \"queen science\" in Comte's schema; all basic physical sciences had to arrive first, leading to the most fundamentally difficult science of human society itself. Comte has thus come to be viewed as the \"Father of Sociology\". Comte delineated his broader philosophy of science in  The Course in Positive Philosophy  [1830\u20131842], whereas his  A General View of Positivism  (1865) emphasized the particular goals of sociology.\nA fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the  sociological positivism  of  Auguste Comte , who effectively sought to extend and apply the  scientific method  found in the  natural science s to the  social science s. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as  induce  general  scientific law s from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their  metaphysical  abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.\nThough Comte is generally regarded as the \"Father of Sociology\", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker,  \u00c9mile Durkheim  (1858\u20131917), who developed positivism in greater detail. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the  University of Bordeaux  in 1895, publishing his  Rules of the Sociological Method . In 1896, he established the journal  L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique . Durkheim's seminal monograph,  Suicide  (1897), a case study of suicide rates among  Catholic  and  Protestant  populations, distinguished sociological analysis from  psychology  or  philosophy . It also marked a major contribution to the concept of  structural functionalism .\nDurkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate  science . He refined the  positivism  originally set forth by  Auguste Comte , promoting what could be considered as a form of  epistemological   realism , as well as the use of the  hypothetico-deductive model  in social science. For him, sociology was the science of  institution s, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as \"beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity\" and its aim being to discover structural  social fact s. Durkheim was a major proponent of  structural functionalism , a foundational perspective in both sociology and  anthropology . In his view, social science should be purely  holistic ; that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.\nAt the age of sixteen he started working in the metal industry Many years later he obtained the title of Doctor of Laws after he passed the examination by the Central Board of State (in Leuven). He continued his studies at the Higher Institute of Philosophy (ISP) in  Leuven  and became editor of the newspaper \" The Twentieth Century \". In 1898, he won the first prize in philosophy and was assigned a scholarship  enabling him to spend eighteen months in Germany at the universities of Bonn, Leipzig, Berlin and Hamburg. He remained in contact with the ISP and worked for the  Catholic Social Review . He also contributed to an ISP publication as regards noticeable Catholic writers and became a member of the Society of Social Economy (SES ).In 1900 he joined the Belgian Ministry of Education. At the same time he worked under the direction of Cyril Van Overbergh  '  at the Institute of Philosophy, University of Louvain, as a guest lecturer and as co-secretary of the journal \"Sociological Movement\" which was an Annex to the \"Neo-Scholastic Review\". He participated in the creation of the  Belgian Society of Sociology , was together with Georges Legrand secretary of the above-mentioned journal and was engaged as a moderator in the controversies about sociology, torn between the religious (ethical) and scientific approach. During the same period he taught philosophy at the  University of Antwerp  \"Extension for Ladies\" of Mary Elizabeth Belpaire . In 1901 he went on a mission to the  United States  in order to study women\u2019s rights, especially the right of women to vote (suffrage)   A summary of his work appeared in the Journal of Sociology and as an annex to the Neo-Scholastic Review.Through numerous reviews of books and numerous articles in various scientific journals of an intellectual, social and  Catholic  character, he defended, as a former disciple and follower of D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mercier, the positivist thought of  Auguste Comte . As from 1903, he first became a teacher, then a professor at the Higher Trade Institute  in Antwerp where he supervised courses of economics, economic history and political economy. Later he joined the colonial University of Antwerp as a professor. During the First World War and the closure of universities, he found refuge in England at the  University of Cambridge , Christ College. In 1933, his academic career ended and he was awarded the royal decree \"emeritus\" presented to him by  Camille Huysmans . After the  First World War , as a moderate Catholic he defended some of the ideas of  Charles Maurras , but abandoned this path when these ideas took a turn he disapproved of.Until 1940 he participated actively and extensively in socio-political and religious debates in Catholic journals such as \"The Twentieth Century\" and \"La Libre Belgique\", usually on the first page.With his best friend Georges Legrand, professor of social economy at the university faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Gembloux, whom he met at the ISP, he shared his ideas as regards evolution and its development. His entire archives and personal library were destroyed during World War II, when his house was bombed shortly after Fernand Deschamps had left it.\nSociology was originally established by  Auguste Comte  (1798\u20131857) in 1838. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm. He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological  positivism , an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy [1830\u20131842] and  A General View of Positivism  (1844). Though Comte is generally regarded as the \"Father of Sociology\", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker,  \u00c9mile Durkheim  (1858\u20131917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical  social research . Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the  University of Bordeaux  in 1895, publishing his  Rules of the Sociological Method . In 1896, he established the journal  L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique . Durkheim's seminal monograph,  Suicide  (1897), a case study of suicide rates among  Catholic  and  Protestant  populations, distinguished sociological analysis from  psychology  or  philosophy .\nHolyoake's  secularism  was strongly influenced by  Auguste Comte , the founder of  positivism  and of modern  sociology . Comte believed human history would progress in a \" law of three stages \" from a  theological  phase, to the \" metaphysical \", toward a fully rational \"positivist\" society. In later life, Comte had attempted to introduce a \" religion of humanity \" in light of growing anti-religious sentiment and social malaise in  revolutionary France . This religion would necessarily fulfil the  functional , cohesive role that supernatural religion once served.\nIn the area of social theory, Levine published a hundred papers and five books. He was especially well known for his critical interpretations of  Auguste Comte ,  Emile Durkheim ,  Max Weber ,  Talcott Parsons ,  Robert Merton ,  S.N. Eisenstadt , and above all  Georg Simmel , in whose writings he is often credited for helping to inspire a renaissance of interest. His book, Georg Simmel on Individuality and Social Forms is one of the definitive collections of Simmel's sociological contributions. He taught classical sociological theory to first-year students in Chicago's Department of Sociology for decades. He was elected Chair of the Theory Section of the  American Sociological Association  in 1997, and for two decades served as editor of the  University of Chicago Press 's Heritage of Sociology series. Levine served on the editorial boards of the  American Journal of Sociology ,  Journal of Classical Sociology , Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, and  Theory Culture and Society .\nThe theory of commodity fetishism () originated from Karl Marx's references to fetishes and fetishism in his analyses of religious superstition, and in the criticism of the beliefs of  political economists . Marx borrowed the concept of \"fetishism\" from The Cult of Fetish Gods (1760) by  Charles de Brosses , which proposed a materialist theory of the origin of religion. Moreover, in the 1840s, the philosophic discussion of fetishism by  Auguste Comte , and  Ludwig Feuerbach 's psychological interpretation of religion also influenced Marx's development of commodity fetishism.\nEven although, in his Treatise on Toleration (1763), the famous French liberal philosopher  Voltaire  expressed a distaste for  religious fanaticism , he was at the same time convinced that religion could be a useful tool to keep the masses under control. He said famously, \"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.\" In his  \u00c9p\u00eetre \u00e0 l'Auteur du Livre des Trois Imposteurs , a criticism of atheism in which he makes this remark, Voltaire opined that faith in God is a \"sublime system\" that is \"necessary to man\": it is, \"...the sacred tie that binds society.\" Similar ideas have been expressed by numerous political leaders, business leaders, and intellectuals for centuries, both right-wing and left-wing. In their utopias of social engineering, early socialistic thinkers such as  Auguste Comte  (Treatise on Sociology Instituting the Religion of Humanity 1851-54) and  Henri de Saint-Simon  (New Christianity 1825) envisaged a new secular (or \"scientific\") belief-system, analogous to a religion, which would unite the people humanely, and ensure social cohesion. This idea is not as unrealistic as it sounds, but it could be interpreted as an opportunist use of people's faith for political purposes.\nHolyoake was influenced by the French  philosopher of science ,  Auguste Comte , notable in the discipline of  sociology  and famous for the doctrine of  positivism . Comte had himself attempted to establish a secular ' religion of humanity ' to fulfil the cohesive  function  of traditional religion. Holyoake was an acquaintance of  Harriet Martineau , the English translator of various works by Comte and perhaps the first female sociologist. She wrote to him excitedly upon reviewing  Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species  in 1859.\nParsons shared positivism's desire for a general unified theory, not only for the social science but for the whole realm of action systems (in which Parsons included the concept of \"living systems\"). On the other hand, he departed from them on the criteria for science, particularly on  Auguste Comte `s proposition that scientists must not look for the \"ultimate ends\" so as to avoid unanswerable metaphysical questions. Parsons maintained that, at least for the social sciences, a meaningful theory had to include the question of \"ultimate values\", which by their very nature and definition, included questions of metaphysics. As such, Parsons theory stands at least with one foot in the sphere of hermeneutics and similar interpretive paradigms, which become particularly relevant when the question of \"ends\" need to be considered within systems of action-orientation. As such, system theorists such as  Talcott Parsons  can be viewed as at least partially  antipositivist . It should be noted that Parsons was not a functionalist per se, but an action theorist. In fact, he never used the term functionalism to refer to his own theory. Also, his use of the term \"structural functionalism\", generally understood as a characterization of his theory. was used by Parsons in a special context to describe a particular stage in the methodological development of the social sciences.\nAt the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological  antipositivism , proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural  norm s,  values , symbols, and social processes viewed from a  subjective  perspective.  Max Weber  argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships\u2014especially among  ideal type s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a nonpositivist however, one seeks relationships that are not as \"ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable\" as those pursued by natural scientists.  Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies  presented  Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft  (sometimes translated as community and society) as the two  normal type s of human association, a distinction that was developed further by  Max Weber . T\u00f6nnies drew a sharp line between the realm of conceptuality and the reality of  social action : the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ('pure' sociology), whereas the second empirically and in an inductive way ('applied' sociology). Both Weber and  Georg Simmel  pioneered the  Verstehen  (or 'interpretative') approach toward social science; a systematic process in which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point-of-view. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the  phenomenological  and  existential  writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality. His sociology engaged in a  neo-Kantian  critique of the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'\nInspired by  Auguste Comte , Ardig\u00f2 differed from Comte in that he considered thought more important than matter and insisted on psychological disquisition. He believed thought was dominant in every action and the result of every action, and that it disappears only in a state of general corruption.\nThe  Positivist  philosophy that took form in Poland after the  January 1863 Uprising  was hardly identical with the philosophy of  Auguste Comte .  It was in fact a return to the line of  Jan \u015aniadecki  and  Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj \u2014a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period\u2014now enriched with the ideas of Comte.  However, it belonged only partly to  philosophy .  It combined Comte's ideas with those of  John Stuart Mill  and  Herbert Spencer , for it was interested in what was common to them all:  a sober,  empirical  attitude to life.\nThe first Polish sociological text was My\u015bl og\u00f3lna fizjologii powszechnej (General Thought on Universal  Physiology ), written and published by economist  J\u00f3zef Supi\u0144ski  in 1860. The first Polish sociological thought reflected the currents of the early sociology and thoughts of the discipline's three founding fathers : Auguste Comte 's ( positivism ),  Karl Marx 's (Marxism) and theories of  \u00c9mile Durkheim . Prominent among the first Polish sociologists were  Ludwik Gumplowicz ,  Leon Petra\u017cycki ,  Edward Abramowski , and  Kazimierz Kelles-Krauz .\nAccording to Comte,  scientific method  frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws\u2014positive statements\u2014irrefutable by  theology  or by  metaphysics .  Regarding experience to justify enumerative induction by having shown  uniformity of nature ,  Mill  welcomed Comte's positivism, but thought  laws  susceptible to recall or revision, and withheld from Comte's  Religion of Humanity .  Comte was confident to lay  laws  as  irrefutable foundation of other knowledge , and the churches, honoring eminent scientists, sought to focus public mindset on  altruism \u2014a term Comte coined\u2014to  apply science  for humankind's social welfare via Comte's spearheaded science,  sociology .\nAuguste Comte  coined the name sociology and published a rambling exposition under the title of Cours de Philosophie Positive in 1839.  Martineau undertook a translation that was published in two volumes in 1853 as The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau). It was a remarkable achievement, and a successful one; Comte recommended her volumes to his students instead of his own. Some writers regard Martineau as the first female sociologist. Her introduction of Comte to the English-speaking world and the elements of sociological perspective in her original writings support her credit as a sociologist.\nThe French philosopher,  Auguste Comte  (1798\u20131857), established the epistemological perspective of  positivism  in The Course in Positivist Philosophy, a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ( mathematics ,  astronomy ,  physics ,  chemistry ,  biology ), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of  social science : \" sociologie \". For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex \"Queen science\" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general ' law of three stages '. These are (1) the theological, (2) the metaphysical, and (3) the positive.\nSocial progress is the idea that societies can or do improve in terms of their social, political, and economic structures. The concept of social progress was introduced in the early 19th century  social theories , especially those of  social evolutionists  like  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . It was present in the  Enlightenment 's  philosophies of history .\nAuguste Comte , the self-professed founder of modern  sociology , put forward the view that the rigorous ordering of confirmable observations alone ought to constitute the realm of human knowledge. He had hoped to order the sciences in increasing degrees of complexity from mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and a new discipline called \"sociology\", which is the study of the \"dynamics and statics of society\".\nIn the West, proponents of scientific social planning such as the sociologist  Auguste Comte , and social researchers, such as  Charles Booth , contributed to the emergence of social policy in the first industrialised countries following the  industrial revolution . Surveys of poverty exposing the brutal conditions in the urban  slum  conurbations of  Victorian Britain  supplied the pressure leading to changes such as the  decline and abolition of the poor law system  and  Liberal welfare reforms . Other significant examples in the development of social policy are the  Bismarckian welfare state  in 19th century  Germany ,  social security policies in the United States  introduced under the rubric of the  New Deal  between 1933 and 1935, and the  National Health Service Act 1946  in Britain.\nThe methodological approach toward sociology by early theorists was to treat the discipline in broadly the same manner as  natural science . An emphasis on  empiricism  and the  scientific method  was sought to provide an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish sociology from less empirical fields such as  philosophy .This perspective, termed positivism, was first developed by theorist Auguste Comte. Positivism was founded on the theory that the only true, factual knowledge is scientific knowledge. Comte had very vigorous guidelines for a theory to be considered positivism. He thought that this authentic knowledge can only be derived from positive confirmation of theories through strict continuously tested methods, that are not only scientifically but also quantitatively based.  \u00c9mile Durkheim  was a major proponent of theoretically grounded empirical research, seeking correlations to reveal structural laws, or \" social fact s\".  Durkheim proved that concepts that had been attributed to the individual were actually socially determined. These occurrences are things such as suicide, crime, moral outrage, a person\u2019s personality, time, space, and God. He brought to light that society had influence on all aspects of a person, far more than had been previously believed. For him, sociology could be described as the \"science of  institution s, their genesis and their functioning\". Durkheim endeavoured to apply sociological findings in the pursuit of political reform and social  solidarity .  Today, scholarly accounts of Durkheim's positivism may be vulnerable to exaggeration and oversimplification: Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in the same way as noble science, whereas Durkheim acknowledged in greater detail the fundamental  epistemological  limitations.\nIn 1780, Siey\u00e8s coined the term sociologie in an unpublished manuscript. The term was used again fifty years later by the philosopher  Auguste Comte  to refer to the science of society, which is known in English as sociology.\nIsidore Marie Auguste Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Comte (; 19 January 1798 \u2013 5 September 1857) was a French philosopher who founded the discipline of  sociology  and the  doctrine  of  positivism . He is sometimes regarded as the first  philosopher of science  in the modern sense of the term.\nSpencer read with excitement the original  positivist  sociology of  Auguste Comte . A  philosopher of science , Comte had proposed a theory of  sociocultural evolution  that society progresses by a general  law of three stages . Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Given the primacy with which Spencer placed on evolution in his work, Spencer's sociology might be described as  socially Darwinistic  (though strictly speaking he was a proponent of  Lamarckism  rather than Darwinism).  Despite the popularity of this view, such a description of Spencer's sociology is mistaken.  While Spencer's political and ethical writings had themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are not present in Spencer's sociological works, which focus on building a theory regarding how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing amounts of complexity amongst the various forms of social organization\nAuguste Comte, known as father of sociology, formulated the  law of three stages : human development progresses from the  theological  stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings, through  metaphysical stage  in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them until the final  positive  stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of world.\nFollowing Ward as president of the American Sociological Association was  William Graham Sumner  from 1908 to 1909. He also held the first professorship of sociology at  Yale College , and in 1876, Sumner became the first to teach a course entitled \"sociology\" in the English-speaking world. His course focused predominantly on the work of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . He was ideologically opposed to the sociology of Ward as he felt that society could not be steered by scientific intervention, and famously stated the alternative to \"survival of the fittest\" was the \"survival of the unfittest.\" However, he also opposed the grand theorizing of Spencer. During the  Progressive Era  in the United States, social Darwinism became a contentious topic and Sumner and his course at  Yale College  was criticized for including Spencerian ideas. This almost led to Sumner's expulsion from teaching. His most famous sociological works are What Social Classes Owe to Each Other in 1883 and Folkways: a study of the sociological importance of usages, manners, customs, mores, and morals in 1906.\nDilthey was also interested in what some would call  sociology  in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of  Auguste Comte  and  Herbert Spencer . He objected to their  dialectic al/ evolution ist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, as well as their narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of  positivism  was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good things to say about the  neo-Kantian  sociology of  Georg Simmel , with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of  Max Weber , the primary founder of sociological  antipositivism . J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of  nonpositivist verstehende sociology  and the  Verstehen  method.\nIn the 1850s,  Auguste Comte , the Father of Sociology, founded  Positivism , a \"religion of humanity\".  Auguste Comte was a student and secretary for  Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon , the Father of French Socialism. Auguste Comte coined the term \"altruism\".\nFrom an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the nineteenth century's three masters of the \"school of suspicion\", alongside  Friedrich Nietzsche  and  Sigmund Freud , and as one of the three principal architects of modern  social science  along with  \u00c9mile Durkheim  and  Max Weber . In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the  scientific method . Both Marx and  Auguste Comte  set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European  secularisation  and new developments in the  philosophies of history  and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean  sociological positivism  in attempt to develop a science of society.  Karl L\u00f6with  considered Marx and  S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard  to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors. In modern  sociological theory ,  Marxist sociology  is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives.  Isaiah Berlin  considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology, \"in so far as anyone can claim the title\". Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts, and the humanities.\nThe word  sociology  (or \"sociologie\") is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. The  Latin  word:  socius , \"companion\"; the suffix  -logy , \"the study of\" from  Greek   -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1  from  \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 , l\u00f3gos, \"word\", \"knowledge\". It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist  Emmanuel-Joseph Siey\u00e8s  (1748\u20131836) in an unpublished  manuscript . Sociology was later defined independently by the French  philosopher of science ,  Auguste Comte  (1798\u20131857), in 1838. Comte used this term to describe a new way of looking at society. Comte had earlier used the term \"social physics\", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician  Adolphe Quetelet . Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the  French Revolution , he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological  positivism , an epistemological approach outlined in  The Course in Positive Philosophy  (1830\u20131842) and  A General View of Positivism  (1848). Comte believed a  positivist stage  would mark the final era, after conjectural  theological  and  metaphysical  phases, in the progression of human understanding. In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first  philosopher of science  in the modern sense of the term.\nWord Origin and History for sociology Expand. n. the science of social phenomena, 1843, from French sociologie, a hybrid coined 1830 by French philosopher Isidore Auguste Comte (1798-1857), from Latin socius associate (see social (adj.)) + Greek-derived suffix -logie (see -logy).\nAccording to French philosopher Auguste Comte, society passes through what three stages on its quest for knowledge?

Social Statics: Study of social structure, functions, social system, social relationships etc. 2. Social Dynamics:\nthe social sciences, sociology emerged in Western Europe as a distinct discipline in the mid-1800s. Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber were early thinkers in the development of sociology. The idea of applying the scientific method to the social world, known as positivism, was first proposed by Auguste Comte. Based on this innovation and Comte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to apply the scientific method to social life, he is credited as being the founder of sociology.\n(...).

The social, cultural and economic fabric of a nation derives in large part from its population dynamics.\nAuguste Comte, the Father of Positivism, pointed out the need to keep society unified as many traditions were diminishing. He was the first person to coin the term sociology. Auguste Comte suggests that sociology is the product of a three-stage development.\nAuguste Comte. credited with being the most influential of the philosophers of the early 1800s, believed that a theoretical science of society and a systematic investigation of behavior were needed to improve society.\nAccording to functionalism, sociologists can explain social structures and social behavior in terms of the components of a society and their functions. Auguste Comte helped develop functionalism in the 19th century, and functionalist Emile Durkheim later compared society to the human body.\nIsidore Marie Auguste Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Xavier Comte (French pronunciation: \u00e2\u0080\u008b; 19 January 1798 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 5 September 1857) was a French philosopher who founded the discipline of praxeology and the doctrine of positivism.

I will discuss their main ideas and concerns about the changing societies that they encountered. The Frenchman Auguste Comte (1798-1857) grew up in the wake of the French revolution of 1789.\nThe term sociology was coined by Auguste Comte in 1839. Comte is also the father of positivism. Comte's theory of positivism limits knowledge to the observable, and is crucial in approaching sociology as a science. The study of society dates back to Greek philosophers, however it was not distinguished as its own field of study until Comte.\nSociology began as an intellectual/philosophical effort by a French man named Auguste Comte (born 1798 and died 1857). He is considered the founder of sociology and coined Sociology.. Comte's Definition of Sociology is the science of society. In his observation Comte believed that society's knowledge passed through 3 stages which he observed in France. His life came in what he called the positivism stage (science-based).\nAuguste Comte.

This biography of Comte provides detailed information about his childhood, life, works, achievements & timeline.\nThe thoughts of Auguste Comte (1798-1857), who coined the term sociology, while dated and riddled with weaknesses, continue in many ways to be important to contemporary sociology.\nRitzer and Goodman identify eight positive contributions that Comte made to sociology: 1  Comte coined the term sociology and may be viewed as its founder. 2  Comte thought of sociology as a positivistic science. 3  He elaborated four methods of sociology. 4  He distinguished social statics from social dynamics.\nThe list of sociologists and their contributions include Auguste  Comte who was the founder of positivism and invented the term  'sociology', Emile Durkheim who maintained t\u00e2\u0080\u00a6he existence of social  facts and Karl Marx who maintained that conflict exists between  different classes in society.\nAltruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness. The word was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism. He derived it from the Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning other people or somebody else.\nComte proposed sociology to be studied in two main parts (i) the social statics and (ii) the social dynamics. These two concepts represent a basic division in the subject-matter of sociology. The social statics deals with the major institutions of society such as family, economy or polity.\nAuguste Comte is considered a forerunner in the field. \u00c3\u0089mile \u00c3\u00a9mile, durkheim who came After, comte is usually the most recognized as a father of, sociology. however", "key": "79_2", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.348449", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
