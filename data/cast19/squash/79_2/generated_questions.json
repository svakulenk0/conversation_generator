The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the  Darwinian revolution  in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as  socially Darwinistic  terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before  Darwin  published anything on the subject. Encouraged by his friend and follower  Edward L. Youmans, Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term \"sociology\" in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal  International Monthly,  Franklin H. Giddings  (1855\u20131931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that \"first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest\" in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States,  Charles Horton Cooley, stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology \"probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since.\" It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including  \u00c9mile Durkheim, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim\u2019s  Division of Labour in Society  is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable  biologist, Spencer coined the term \" survival of the fittest \" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a  laissez-faire  style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the  United States  and  England.

It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as Comte, Karl Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004).

Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can\u2019t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation.
