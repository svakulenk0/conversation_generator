{"input_text": "In  medicine , when referring to  human feces , blood in stool looks different depending on (1) how early it enters the intestines (and thus how much digestive action it has been exposed to) and on (2) how much there is (a little bit, more than a little, or a lot). This is why bright red blood in the stool has different clinical significance (and a different name) than brown or black blood in the stool. Thus the term can refer either to  melena , with more blackish appearance, originating from  upper gastrointestinal bleeding , or to  hematochezia , with more red color, originating from  lower gastrointestinal bleeding . The term \"blood in stool\" is usually not used to describe  fecal occult blood , which refers to blood that is not visible and thus is found only after chemical testing is performed.\nThe color of erythrocytes is due to the heme group of hemoglobin. The  blood plasma  alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin.  Pulse oximetry  takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the  arterial  blood  oxygen saturation  using  colorimetric  techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for  carbon monoxide , forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.\nIn nature, the red color of  blood  comes from  hemoglobin , the iron-containing protein found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates.  The red color of the  Grand Canyon  and other geological features is caused by  hematite  or red  ochre ,  both forms of  iron oxide .  It also causes the red color of the planet  Mars .  The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as  Rayleigh scattering , which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye.    The color of  autumn leaves  is caused by pigments called  anthocyanin s, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green  chlorophyll  is no longer produced.  One to two percent of the human population has  red hair ; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment  pheomelanin  (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment  eumelanin .\n1 The value is given as a percentage of red blood cells in a volume of blood. 2  For example, a hematocrit of 38 means that 38% of the blood's volume is made of red blood cells. 3  Hematocrit and hemoglobin values are the two major tests that show if anemia or polycythemia is present.4  Hemoglobin (Hgb). The hemoglobin molecule fills up the red blood cells. 2  It carries oxygen and gives the blood cell its red color. 3  The hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in blood and is a good measure of the blood's ability to carry oxygen throughout the body.\nBlood is a specialized body fluid. It has four main components: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood has many different functions, including: 1  transporting oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and tissues.2  forming blood clots to prevent excess blood loss.lood appears red because of the large number of red blood cells, which get their color from the hemoglobin. The percentage of whole blood volume that is made up of red blood cells is called the hematocrit and is a common measure of red blood cell levels.\nThat's why blood looks red (it has iron and oxygen in it), and it's also why rusty iron looks red (the rust is iron that has combined with oxygen from the air or water). And that's the way Greek black-figure and red-figure vase painting works.hen the supernova explodes, it shoots out carbon, oxygen, and iron atoms all over the Universe, and eventually gravity sucks these atoms into new planets like Earth. All of the iron on Earth was originally inside stars.\nWhat color is the dumbo octopus? Why is octopus blood blue?

Over time, red blood cells wear out and die. The bone marrow continually makes more red blood cells. Certain foods increase production of red blood cells.\nWhy Blood Is Red. Human blood is red because it contains a large number of red blood cells, which contain hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a red-colored, iron-containing protein that functions in oxygen transport by reversibly binding to oxygen. Oxygenated hemoglobin and blood are bright red; deoxygenated hemoglobin and blood are dark red.\nThe oxygen gives your blood its bright red color. Click to Enlarge. Red blood cells are round with a flattish, indented center, like doughnuts without a hole. Your health care provider can check on the size, shape, and health of your red blood cells using tests, such as the complete blood count screening.ed blood cells at work. Hemoglobin is the protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide from your body, transporting it to the lungs for you to exhale.\nCyanosis is a bluish hue to the skin, gums, fingernails, or mucous membranes caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood.When blood is fully oxygenated it appears bright red; when it lacks oxygen supply, the blood is a dark purple or bluish red.This lack of oxygen in the blood supply to a body part, such as the nail bed, skin, or mucous membrane, causes that body part to take on a bluish tint.Oxygen is present in your blood through hemoglobin, a red blood cell protein that carries oxygen.hen blood is fully oxygenated it appears bright red; when it lacks oxygen supply, the blood is a dark purple or bluish red. This lack of oxygen in the blood supply to a body part, such as the nail bed, skin, or mucous membrane, causes that body part to take on a bluish tint.\nHemoglobin is a molecule that is within a red blood cell. Each red blood cell is about one third hemoglobin by volume.Each red blood cell can carry four hemoglobin molecules. Hemoglobin is responsible for the color of blood. When they put that thing on the tip of your finger at the ER they are measuring the percentage of hemoglobin's that are in red blood cells.ach red blood cell is about one third hemoglobin by volume. Each red blood cell can carry four hemoglobin molecules. Hemoglobin is responsible for the color of blood.\nSample Report. Anemia occurs when you have less than the normal number of red blood cells in your blood or when the red blood cells in your blood don't have enough hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein that gives the red color to your blood.Its main job is to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body.ample Report. Anemia occurs when you have less than the normal number of red blood cells in your blood or when the red blood cells in your blood don't have enough hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein that gives the red color to your blood.\nHuman blood is red because of the iron in the haemoglobin. This gives red blood cells their red colour. Veinous blood is much darker than arterial blood, and your teacher is right that oxygenated (arterial) blood is 'redder' than deoxygenated (veinous) blood. However, human blood is not blue. Some animals do have blue blood though.\nOverview. Red blood cells are important for the transport of oxygen-rich blood to body tissues and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Red blood cells are red because they contain an iron-rich protein known as hemoglobin, which is bright red in color. Over time, red blood cells wear out and die.The bone marrow continually makes more red blood cells. Certain foods increase production of red blood cells.olic Acid-Rich Foods. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is a B-complex vitamin that helps the body make new healthy red blood cells. Patients with low levels of folic acid often develop anemia. Patients can increase red blood cells in the body by consuming foods rich in folic acid.\nAnswer 1: Blood is red because it is made up of cells that are red, which are called red blood cells. But, to understand why these cells are red you have to study them on a molecular level. Within the red blood cells there is a protein called hemoglobin.Each hemoglobin protein is made up subunits called hemes, which are what give blood its red color. More specifically, the hemes can bind iron molecules, and these iron molecules bind oxygen.The blood cells are red because of the interaction between iron and oxygen.nswer 1: Blood is red because it is made up of cells that are red, which are called red blood cells.

Blood is made up of four components. These are red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma. Blood is made up of 55% plasma and 45% solids. Red blood cells 99% of red blood cells are red blood cells or erythrocytes. They are red in colour due to the prescience of a red coloured protein called haemoglobin.\nBlood is red because of the hemoglobin inside our red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a protein that forms a complex with iron molecules and together they transport oxygen molecules throughout the body. Iron has the property of reflecting red light and because there is so much iron in our blood, blood looks red.\nThe idea that oxygenated blood is red and deoxygenated blood is blue is a common misconception. In fact, human blood is never blue. It does change color depending on the level of oxygenation. In the arteries, where blood is fully oxygenated, it appears bright red, while in the veins, where the oxygen is depleted, it is a dark red. Blood derives its red color from hemoglobin, a reddish iron-containing protein that is found in red blood cells.\nRBC: Short for red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen and carbon dioxide through the blood. This rather remarkable feat is thanks to hemoglobin, the pigment that makes red cells (and blood) look red. The red blood cells are also known as red corpuscles or erythrocytes (literally, red hollow vessels). RBC also stands for the red cell count, the number of red blood cells in a given volume of blood.\nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body.nemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated.\nTypes of Blood cells. They are broadly of 3 types of blood cells like. 1. Red blood cells (R.B.C) / Red blood corposcules. 2. White blood cells. 3. Platelets/ thrombocytes. Red blood cells: These are cells responsible for reddish color of the blood.They are very high in concentration to other blood cells.hey are broadly of 3 types of blood cells like. 1.
