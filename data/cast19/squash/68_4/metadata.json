{"input_text": "Balsamic vinegar is an aromatic aged vinegar produced in the  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia  provinces of Italy.  The original productTraditional Balsamic Vinegaris made from the concentrated juice, or must, of white  Trebbiano  grapes. It is very dark brown, rich, sweet, and complex, with the finest grades being aged in successive casks made variously of oak, mulberry, chestnut, cherry, juniper, and ash wood. Originally a costly product available to only the Italian upper classes, traditional balsamic vinegar is marked \"tradizionale\" or \"DOC\" to denote its  Protected Designation of Origin  status, and is aged for 12 to 25 years. A cheaper non-DOC commercial form described as \"aceto balsamico di Modena\" (balsamic vinegar of Modena) became widely known and available around the world in the late 20th century, typically made with concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar, then coloured and slightly sweetened with caramel and sugar.\nThe original, costly,  traditional balsamic vinegar  (Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale), is made from a  reduction  of cooked white  Trebbiano   grape juice , and used as a  condiment .  It has been produced in  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia  since the  Middle Ages , being mentioned in a document dated 1046. Appreciated in the  House of Este  during the  Renaissance , it is highly valued by modern  chef s and  gourmet  food lovers.\nIn addition to cider, Aspall also produce an unfermented  apple juice , organic  Cyder Vinegar  and Apple  Balsamic Vinegar . The company also imports and markets: Spanish Red  Wine Vinegar  and White Wine Vinegar, and an Italian Organic Balsamic Vinegar.\nTraditional balsamic vinegar is produced from the juice of just-harvested white grapes (typically,  Trebbiano  grapes) boiled down to approximately 30% of the original volume to create a concentrate or  mosto , which is then fermented with a slow aging process which concentrates the flavours. The flavour intensifies over the years, with the vinegar being stored in wooden casks, becoming sweet, viscous and very concentrated. During this period, a portion evaporates: it is said that this is the \" angels' share \", a term also used in the production of  bourbon whiskey ,  scotch whisky ,  wine , and other alcoholic beverages.\nCommercial vinegar is produced either by fast or slow fermentation processes. In general, slow methods are used with traditional vinegars, and fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of months or a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria.  Fast methods add  mother of vinegar  ( bacterial culture ) to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced in 20 hours to three days.\nBalsamic vinegar of Modena is a variety of  balsamic vinegar  and an  IGP  condiment from Italy. It is produced according to various recipes. The IGP production regulations leaves plenty of leeway, allowing the use of grape must (even if it is not from the provinces of Modena and Reggio Emilia) in percentages between 20 and 90% and wine vinegar between 10 and 80%. The use of caramel is allowed, up to 2%. Reading the tag can provide useful information on the ingredients used and the processing methods. Withdrawals and reinforcements are not expected, that are typical of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar; the ingredients, once mixed, must be kept in wood containers for a duration of at least 60 days. If the product is kept there for 3 years or more it's labeled \"invecchiato\".The Balsamic vinegar of Modena gained the  IGP  label on 3 July 2009.\nTBV is produced in two different geographical areas of the Emilia Romagna Region so that two different designations were granted by the European Council, i.e. Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (TBVM) and Traditional Balsamico Vinegar of Reggio Emilia (TBVRE). The two special vinegars are very similar products as the overall making procedure is the same; but, under a legal point of view, they are obtained according to specific and official production regulations defining (1) the basis of the vineyards ampelographic; (2) geographical area of production; (3) characteristics of starting materials; (4) making procedure; (5) the chemical, physical and sensorial requirements for sale; (6) bottling, labelling and presentation. The sensory profile of TBV is evaluated by hedonicjudgment expressed through a numeric score. The sensory score achieved is used to rank TBV in different commercial classes. The specific regulations allow adding \"Extra Vecchio\" to the official designation when the product is aged for 25 years at least.  However, under existing regulations, neither the definition of \"aging\" nor the methods for its objective evaluation are specified; it is evaluated only through panel-tasting tests, whose effectiveness for this purpose is clearly inadequate. TBV results as a blend of vinegars of different composition and age due to the traditional making procedure. Actually, an easy-to-use mathematical method for evaluating the actual residence time of TBV within each cask of the barrel set has been recently published. This method is an adequate tool helping aging certification. An easy-to-use spreadsheet of the theoretical model is available for download here. At present, however, independent agencies that officially state TBV authenticity of both the TBVM and TBVRE haven't adopted it or any analogous procedure as an evaluation system.\nTraditional Balsamic Vinegar (or Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale) is a type of  balsamic vinegar  produced in the  Emilia Romagna  region of  Italy . Unlike inexpensive \"Balsamic Vinegar of Modena\" (BVM), Traditional Balsamic Vinegar (TBV) is produced from cooked  grape must , aged at least 9 years, and protected under the European  Protected Designation of Origin  (PDO) system, fetching higher prices.  (BVM has lesser protection under the European  Protected Geographical Indication  (PGI) system.) Although the names are similar, TBV and the inexpensive imitation BVM are very different.\nA. aceti  is used for the mass production of acetic acid, the main component in vinegar. During the fermentation process of vinegar production, it is used to act on wines and ciders resulting in vinegar with acetic acid. It can be converted by a silicone tube reactor, which aids the fermentation process with oxidation.\nTraditional balsamic vinegar  is aged in a series of wooden barrels.\nThere are three types of balsamic vinegar:\nRegardless of how it is produced, balsamic vinegar must be made from a grape product. It contains no balsam fruit. A high acidity level is somewhat hidden by the sweetness of the other ingredients, making it very mellow.\nTraditional vinegars are made by  fermenting  alcohol ( wine , in the case of wine vinegar;  cider  for cider vinegar, and an  ale  made from  malted barley  in the case of malt vinegar). The fermentation process takes time, and all the colours in the vinegar occur naturally.\nEmilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regards to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour.  Bologna  is notable for pasta dishes like  tortellini ,  lasagne ,  gramigna  and  tagliatelle  which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations.  The  Romagna  subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like,  garganelli ,  strozzapreti ,  sfoglia lorda  and  tortelli alla lastra . In the  Emilia  subregion, except  Piacenza  which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of  Lombardy , rice is eaten to a lesser extent.  Polenta , a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated  balsamic vinegar  is made only in the Emilian cities of  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia , following legally binding traditional procedures.  Parmigiano Reggiano  (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while  Grana Padano  variety is produced in the rest of the region.\nOnly two consortia produce true traditional balsamic vinegar,  Modena  and neighboring  Reggio Emilia . True balsamic vinegar is made from a reduction of pressed  Trebbiano  and  Lambrusco  grapes.The resulting thick   syrup , called mosto cotto in Italian, is subsequently  aged  for a minimum of 12 years in a battery of several barrels of successively smaller sizes. The casks are made of different woods like  chestnut ,  cherry ,  oak ,  mulberry ,  ash  and  juniper . True balsamic vinegar is rich, glossy, deep brown in color, and has a complex flavour that balances the natural sweet and sour elements of the cooked grape juice with hints of wood from the casks.\nSolera is a process for  aging  liquids such as  wine ,  beer ,  vinegar , and  brandy , by fractional blending in such a way that the finished product is a mixture of ages, with the average age gradually increasing as the process continues over many years. The purpose of this labor-intensive process is the maintenance of a reliable style and quality of the beverage over time. Solera means literally \"on the ground\" in Spanish, and it refers to the lower level of the set of barrels or other containers used in the process; the liquid (traditionally transferred from barrel to barrel, top to bottom, the oldest mixtures being in the barrel right \"on the ground\"), although the containers in today's process are not necessarily stacked physically in the way that this implies, but merely carefully labeled. Products which are often solera aged include  Sherry ,  Madeira ,  Lillet ,  Port wine ,  Marsala ,  Mavrodafni ,  Muscat , and  Muscadelle  wines;  Balsamic ,  Commandaria , some  Vins doux naturels , and  Sherry  vinegars;  Spanish  brandy;  beer ;  rum s; and  whiskies .  Since the origin of this process is undoubtedly out of the Iberian peninsula, most of the traditional terminology was in Spanish, Portuguese, or Catalan.\nVinegar is commonly used in food preparation, in particular in  pickling  processes, vinaigrettes, and other  salad dressings . It is an ingredient in sauces such as mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Vinegar is sometimes used while making  chutney s. It is often used as a condiment.  Marinades  often contain vinegar. In terms of its shelf life, vinegar's acidic nature allows it to last indefinitely without the use of refrigeration.\nece raised the objection that the protection of the expression \" balsamic vinegar \" would have strongly damaged their national production, that have been legalized for five years. They emphasized that the words \"vinegar\" and \"balsamic\", as generic terms, were not amenable to protection. They made known that they would have voted for the IGP label only in exchange for a recognition of their right to use words \"balsamic vinegar\" by Italy. Also Franc\nA dilute alcohol solution inoculated with Acetobacter and kept in a warm, airy place will become vinegar over the course of a few months. Industrial vinegar-making methods accelerate this process by improving the supply of  oxygen  to the bacteria.\nThese are produced by blending a sweet matured vincotto with vinegar produced from the same red grape varieties.  The resulting product is allowed to mature for several more months until it becomes \"legato,\" which means \"smooth.\"  The result is an Apulian balsamic vinegar that can be used in the same way as a balsamic vinegar of Modena, although it does have some additional properties. Red Apulian grapes and wines exhibit a very high polyphenol count, and these act as antioxidants and as a natural flavour enhancer with other foods. They can enhance other flavours when used in a recipe, while not overpowering them, and as is usually the case with other balsamic vinegars, they can be reduced over heat without any bitter caramelization.\nA comprehensive study about the original making procedure, the aging conditions, and the sensory profile is not available.  This and the few and often-confusing documents make the reconstruction of the true history of TBV a challenge.The term balsamico derives from the Latin word \u201cbalsamum\u201d and from the Greek word \u201c\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u201d, in the sense of \"restorative\" or \"curative\". The art of cooking the must of grapes dates back to the ancient Romans: it was used both as a medicine and in the kitchen as a sweetener and condiment.The first generally accepted document referring to a precious vinegar produced in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia is the poem written in the 12th century by the monk Donizo of Canossa, although the word \"balsamic\" is never mentioned. The first testimonies clearly speaking about \"balsamic vinegar\", as well as of recipes and making procedure appear from the 19th century even if little is known about the original recipes and related making practices. The adjective \"balsamic\" has been used to designate any kind of generically aromatic vinegar and products not just obtained from the fermentation of grape must alone.  As far as the aging method is concerned, it is very similar to the  Solera  system used in Spain after Napoleonic Wars, spreading abroad after the second half of the 19th century.\nBologna  and  Modena  are notable for pasta dishes like  tortellini ,  lasagne ,  gramigna  and  tagliatelle  which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated  balsamic vinegar  is made only in the Emilian cities of  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia , following legally binding traditional procedures.  Parmigiano Reggiano  cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while  Grana Padano  variety is produced in Piacenza.\nOther vinegars, such as red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, and balsamic vinegar also do not contain gluten. They are not derived from a gluten grain, therefore they never had gluten to begin with. The primary exception to all of this is malt vinegar.\nBalsamic vinegar is not a vinegar in the usual sense, as it is made from grape juice aged in wooden casks. Traditional balsamic vinegar is aged for a minimum of 12 years and sometimes for 25 years or more. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a minute possibility that gluten based paste used to seal the casks might contaminate the vinegar.\nBalsamic vinegar is gluten free. Photo by JacobEnos. Balsamic vinegar is not a vinegar in the usual sense, as it is made from grape juice aged in wooden casks. Traditional balsamic vinegar is aged for a minimum of 12 years and sometimes for 25 years or more.\nDistilled vinegar is not made from a traditional distillation process. Instead, it is produced from the fermentation of distilled alcohol. Fermented material diluted to 5 to 8 percent acetic acid is commonly referred to as white vinegar. This type of clear vinegar is used in cooking, pickling and household cleaning.\nBalsamic Vinegar Dressing is possibly the simplest of all salad dressings, a classic that everyone should know off by heart! Made with 1 part balsamic vinegar to 3 parts olive oil, plus salt and pepper. A fantastic standby because Balsamic Vinegar Dressing lasts for 3 to 4 weeks. So make a BIG BATCH! Making a Balsamic Vinegar Dressing is as simple as remembering this: 1 part vinegar to 3 parts olive oil.\nThe names Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena) and Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia) are protected by both the Italian Denominazione di origine protetta and the European Union's Protected Designation of Origin.\nBalsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar (Italian: aceto balsamico) is a kind of vinegar inspired by traditional products from Italy. The original, costly, traditional balsamic vinegar (Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale), is made from a reduction of cooked white Trebbiano grape juice, and used as a condiment. It has been produced in Modena and Reggio Emilia since the Middle Ages, being mentioned in a document dated 1046.\nBy Allrecipes Staff.

Food-friendly balsamic vinegar is a rich, dark brown, sweet-sour vinegar made from fermented wine grapes barrel-aged for many years.\nTraditional balsamic vinegar comes from fermented trebbiano grapes often aged for decades in a series of small barrels. Over time, the vinegar becomes increasingly concentrated into a complex-tasting syrup. The best balsamic vinegar is Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena.\nBut it's not.. The old-fashioned way to make fruit vinegar is to press fresh fruit juice and ferment it into wine. Next, the wine is made into vinegar by adding what is known as a mother. This ghostlike mass includes a special kind of bacteria, called acetobacters, that convert the alcohol into acetic acid.What's left is the essence of the fruit brightened by a tangy bite. The process takes from six months to three years.rapes traditionally are used for vinegar. But just about any fruit -- and some vegetables -- can be made into vinegar, as Erwin Gegenbauer has proved. At his craft vinegar brewery in Vienna, Austria, he makes about 40 kinds of fruit vinegars including apricot, blueberry, elderberry, sour cherry and tomato.\nVinegar is an acidic liquid produced through fermentation. Vinegar is used in cooking not only for its flavor qualities, but also its chemical properties. Vinegar can be made from a variety of substances, each lending its own unique flavors and qualities. Vinegar is made through the fermentation of ethanol.n addition to an acidic tartness, vinegar can provide other flavor. Balsamic vinegar is known for its slightly sweet flavor and malt vinegar has a classic, malted barley flavor. Fruit vinegars, like raspberry, are also very popular and have a distinctly fruity flavor.\nChemical formula for vinegar. Vinegar is composed of about 5% acetic acid. This is the major chemical component of vinegar. The systematic or proper chemical name of acetic acid is ethanoic acid.Vinegar is a weak acid produced by the oxidation of alcohol (ethanol) from wines and ciders by bacteria. It has a pleasant sour taste and is used in cooking or as a condiment.It is commercially sold as white vinegar, brown vinegar, cider vinegar and balsamic vinegar. The complete structural formula of acetic acid is as follows. The condensed structural formula for acetic acid (the main component in vinegar) is CH3COOH.This formula is a shorthand way of representing the complete structural formula (see above picture).

A white-coloured cap means the vinegar has aged for at least 12 years and a gold cap bearing the designation extravecchio (extra old) shows the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.\nThe best Balsamic Vinegars have nothing else added to them-only the grapes. There is a lot of confusion about balsamic vinegar. On the grocery shelves you will find $3.00 bottles next to $25.00 bottles (often the $3.00 bottles have fancier labels).But, buyer beware! Not all balsamic vinegars are what they appear to be.alsamic vinegar is a reduction made from grapes, but it is not considered a wine vinegar because the grape juice used is unfermented. The unfermented white sweet grape juice that is used is called must and comes from the Trebbiano grapes. You will find lots of balsamic vinegars in your local stores.\nBalsamic Vinegar of Modena (Aceto Balsamico di Modena), an inexpensive imitation, is today widely available and much better known.odena uses a different system to indicate the age of its balsamic vinegars (Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena).

A quasigovernmental body in Modena, Italy (balsamic vinegar's birthplace), regulates the production of traditional balsamic vinegar.\nVinegar is 5-8% acetic acid in water. The alcohol that forms in the process of making it is negligible. There are traces of alcohol in vinegar but a very small amount. Wine vinegars such as red or white wine and balsamic vinegar do start with a dilute wine which is then fermented. Instead of the bacteria fermenting sugars, as happens when the wine is made, bacteria from the acetobacter family use the alcohol in the fermentation process.\nBalsamic vinegar, for example, is made from must (unfermented juice). Just naming the most common types of vinegar gets you a sizable list: red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, malt vinegar, balsamic vinegar, rice vinegar--and you've barely scratched the surface! Would you believe coconut vinegar, raspberry vinegar, honey vinegar and even beer vinegar (must be over 21)?\n1 In order to bear the name balsamic, the vinegar must be made from the juices of the Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes. The juice is blended and boiled over a fire. It is then poured into barrels of oak, chestnut, cherry, mulberry, and ash.  The juice is allowed to age, ferment, and condense for five years.\nAncellotta, Lumbrusco, and Sauvignon are also commonly used. Balsamic Secrets True, gourmet balsamic vinegar is slowly aged in wooden barrels. Manufacturers have their own secret process and formula for aging the vinegar, moving it from one type of wood barrel to another to create its own unique flavour.he commonly found white vinegar is invariably not produced from wine and has very few if any kashrus concerns.

Whereas regular wine vinegar takes one or two years to ferment, the grape (juice) of balsamic vinegar requires 12 years to age.The long balsamic vinegar process requires great care to produce.olklore maintains that vinegar was discovered quite by accident, when wine was inadvertently left to sour. This resulted in the first batch of full-bodied wine vinegar. Indeed, the word vinegar is derived from the French word vinagere, which means sour wine.\nCider vinegar is processed from apples. Rice or rice wine vinegar is processed from rice wines or fermented rice and comes in three types: black rice vinegar, white rice vinegar and red rice vinegar. They differ by which type of rice they are processed from.\nThere are two types of this popular and flavorful vinegar, traditional and commercial.

This type of clear vinegar is used in cooking, pickling and household cleaning. The starting ingredient for most white vinegar is malt, corn and grain-based ethanol. Yeast is used to ferment the sugar into alcohol, and a second process of fermentation using bacteria turns the alcohol into vinegar. Many types of vinegar other than white use a similar process of fermentation of distilled alcohol.\nQuick Answer. The difference between distilled vinegar and vinegar is based on the raw ingredients used to make the vinegar and the fermentation process. Vinegar can be created from any food that contains natural sugars. Common types of vinegar include white, which is often referred to as distilled vinegar, apple cider, red wine and balsamic.

It ages in wooden barrels for years, sometimes decades. The longer it ferments, the more intense the flavor becomes and the thicker it gets. Balsamic vinegar has an array of health benefits, but you should not use to treat any type of medical ailment.\nWhich to Buy. Apple cider vinegar is not to be confused with the regular, white vinegar found in most kitchens. White vinegar is used in cooking, as well as an effective cleaner in kitchen, bathroom, and for washing. White vinegar, however, is refined and does not have the health benefits of apple cider vinegar. What is Apple Cider Vinegar? Apple cider vinegar is a type of vinegar made from apple must. You get apple must when you crush whole apples, including the skin, stem, and seeds. This apple must is then taken through the process of fermentation and oxygenation. This process converts the sugar in apples to alcohol.\nAnother process for making vinegar involves the fermentation of distilled alcohol. The resulting colorless liquid is then diluted to a standard strength and filtered of all impurities. There are two ways of describing the strength of vinegar: Its acidity, which is measured as a pH value.\nThe authentic (god I hate that word) Italian salad dressing is wine vinegar and olive oil.
