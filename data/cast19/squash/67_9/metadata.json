{"input_text": "Treatment of  megaloblastic anemia  with concurrent vitamin  deficiency using  vitamers (including cyanocobalamin), creates the possibility of  hypokalemia  due to increased  erythropoiesis  (red blood cell production) and consequent cellular uptake of  potassium  upon anemia resolution. When treated with vitamin , patients with  Leber's disease  may suffer serious  optic atrophy , possibly leading to blindness.\nSome children with alpha thalassemia have no symptoms and require no treatment. Others with more severe cases need regular blood transfusions to treat  anemia  and other symptoms. They also may require surgery in early years to repair the abnormalities they were born with or else physical and occupational therapy to help live with terminal transverse limbs. The only way to get alpha thalassemia abnormal morphogenesis is by inheriting it from his or her parents from their genes. Humans are made up of trillions of  cells  that form the structure of our bodies and carry out specialized jobs like taking  nutrients  from  food  and turning them into  energy .  Red blood cells , which contain  hemoglobin  deliver  oxygen  to all parts of the body. All cells have a  nucleus  at their center which is kind of like a  brain  or command post of the  cell . The  nucleus  directs the  cell  telling it to grow, mature, divide, or die. The  nucleus  contains  DNA  otherwise known as  Deoxyribonucleic acid , a long spiral shaped  molecule  that stores the genes that determine hair color, eye color, whether or not the person is right or left handed, and many more traits.  DNA , along with other genes and the information they contain, is passed down from parents to their children during reproduction. Each  cell  has many  DNA  molecules, but because cells are very small and  DNA  molecules are long, the  DNA  is packaged very tightly in each  cell . These packages of  DNA  are calls chromosomes, and each cell has 46 of them each package is arranged into 23 pairs with one of each pair coming from the mother and on from the father. When a child has alpha thalassemia, there is a change in chromosome 16.  Alpha globin is made on  chromosome  16 so if any  gene  that tells  chromosome  16 to produce alpha globin is missing or mutated, less  hemoglobin  is made. This affects  hemoglobin  and decreases the ability of red blood cells to transport  oxygen  to the body.\nIt is estimated that a third of all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.\nMost parts of the tree have been used in  traditional African medicine . The sap has been used to  control bleeding . It is made into an eyewash to treat  cataracts  and  filariasis  of the eye. The bark has been used as a poison  antidote  and a treatment for  leprosy ,  anemia ,  infertility ,  gonorrhea , and  malaria . Leaf extracts are consumed or used in an  enema  to treat  edema . Root extracts are used to treat parasitic infections, such as  schistosomiasis . The seed oil is used to treat  thrush .\nEpoetin beta ( rINN )  is a synthetic,  recombinant  form of  erythropoietin . It stimulates  erythropoiesis  (increases  red blood cell  levels) and is used to treat  anemia , commonly associated with  chronic renal failure  and cancer  chemotherapy .\nAnemia  is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure. The treatment of anemia significantly improves quality of life for those with heart failure, often with a reduction in severity of the NYHA classification, and also improves mortality rates. The latest European guidelines (2012) recommend screening for iron-deficient anemia and treating with  parenteral iron  if anemia is found.\nWith regards to digestive tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding and anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding are treated with endoscopic  argon plasma coagulation  (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may reduce the need for supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual\u2014if encountered, alternative causes (such as a  peptic ulcer ) need to be considered\u2014but embolization may be used in such instances.\nAnother major effect is the loss of the intrinsic-factor-secreting parietal cells in the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor is essential for the uptake of  vitamin B  in the terminal ileum and without it the patient will suffer from a  vitamin B deficiency . This can lead to a type of anemia known as megaloblastic anaemia (can also be caused by folate deficiency, or autoimmune disease where it is specifically known as pernicious anaemia) which severely reduces red-blood cell synthesis (known as  erythropoiesis , as well as other haemotological cell lineages if severe enough but the red cell is the first to be affected). This can be treated by giving the patient direct injections of vitamin B.   Iron-deficiency anemia  can occur as the stomach normally converts iron into its absorbable form.\nEpoetin alfa ( rINN )  is human  erythropoietin  produced in cell culture using  recombinant DNA technology . Authorised by the  European Medicines Agency  on 28 August 2007, it stimulates  erythropoiesis  (increases  red blood cell  levels) and is used to treat  anemia , commonly associated with  chronic renal failure  and cancer  chemotherapy .\nFerrous salt/folic acid is a  supplement  used to prevent  iron deficiency  and  folic acid deficiency  during  pregnancy . It can also be used to treat  iron deficiency anemia . It is a  fixed dose combination  of  ferrous salt  and  folic acid . It is taken by mouth.\nHowell\u2013Jolly bodies are seen with markedly decreased splenic function. Common causes include asplenia (post-splenectomy). Spleen also is removed for therapeutic purposes in conditions like  hereditary spherocytosis , trauma to the spleen, and  autosplenectomy  caused by  sickle cell anemia . Other causes are  radiation therapy  involving the spleen, such as that used to treat  Hodgkin lymphoma .  Howell\u2013Jolly bodies are also seen in:  amyloidosis , severe  hemolytic anemia ,  megaloblastic anemia , hereditary spherocytosis,  heterotaxy  with asplenia and  myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS). Also can be seen in premature infants.\nFrequent  blood transfusion s are given in the first year of life to treat anemia. Prednisone may be given, although this should be avoided in infancy because of side effects on growth and brain development. A  bone marrow transplant  may be necessary if other treatment fails.\nJeff, a well-known cyclist, is cycling in a non-profitable charity race, when he is unable to breathe and taken to the hospital. House finds it surprising that Jeff admitted he is taking illegal enhancement drugs. He agreed to blood doping, which is common among cyclists, to better one's athletic performance. Because red blood cells carry oxygen between the lungs and the muscles, a higher number of red blood cells can increase an athlete\u2019s endurance. While trying to figure out what cause of Jeff\u2019s respiratory distress, they find an embolus in his chest. While Dr. Chase works to remove the air bubble, Jeff begins to feel numbness in his legs, but is told that it might be due to the sedation. While his manager talks to the press, Jeff loses feeling in his legs. Dr. Cameron informs House that Jeff\u2019s red blood count is continually dropping, revealing that his body is no longer able to produce red blood cells on its own. House becomes convinced that Jeff might have lied about a specific drug that could be the cause of all of his symptoms, Erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced in the kidney that promotes the formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Adding more blood cells increases the oxygen level in the blood, thus presumably causing all of Jeff's symptoms as he fails to produce red blood cells on his own. Which is explanation for him also having anemia, caused by a chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), probably resulting from his use of blood doping. After responding to a Prednisone treatment, Jeff began losing more red blood cells to the point of requiring a transfusion. House scans Jeff's neck and a Thymoma is discovered; an extremely rare tumor on the thymus, confirming that he wasn\u2019t taking EPO, but he did have Chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia. Due to the diagnosis he can legally blood dope, or get a Thymectomy which could only bring him into a temporary remission, and then after he would have to be on medical steroids.\nRed blood cell transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of red blood cells should be based on the patient's clinical condition.\nTreatment: Procedures. If you have severe anemia, you may need a transfusion of blood that matches your type. When the body's production of red blood cells doesn't work right, anemia may be treated or cured with a transplant.\nRed blood cells are prepared from whole blood by removing plasma, or the liquid portion of the blood, and they are used to treat anemia while minimizing an increase in blood volume. Improvements in cell preservation solutions over decades have increased the shelf-life of red blood cells from 21 to 42 days.\nIRON (AHY ern) replaces iron that is essential to healthy red blood cells.

Anemia Caused by Blood Loss. If you suddenly lose a large volume of blood, you may be treated with fluids, a blood transfusion, oxygen, and possibly iron to help your body build new red blood cells.\nDefinition. Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a condition in which blood lacks adequate healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues.As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin).As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath. You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation.ithout enough iron, your body can't produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin). As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath. You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation.\nYour blood can be separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma. Red blood cells are used to treat patients who are anemic. Plasma can be used to treat patients in shock due to fluid loss as a result of burns. Platelets are used to help treat patients with leukemia.\nAnadrol-50 (oxymetholone) is used to treat certain types of anemia (lack of red blood cells), including aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, or hypoplastic anemia caused by chemotherapy.It is an anabolic steroid.nadrol-50 (oxymetholone) is used to treat certain types of anemia (lack of red blood cells), including aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, or hypoplastic anemia caused by chemotherapy.\nPacked red blood cell transfusions are given to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood. There may be several reasons why your blood supply is low. You may have a low hemoglobin and hematocrit reading (anemia), loss of blood during surgery or trauma, or bleeding internally in the intestines. The loss of blood may be sudden (acute) or slow (chronic). A packed red blood cell transfusion is almost always necessary for a blood loss of more than 30 percent. Transfusions are indicated when the blood pressure decreases and the heart rate increases during an episode of bleeding. Chronic anemia patients may not need a blood transfusion if they are not showing symptoms of a crisis. Chronic anemia should be treated with methods other than transfusions.\nThe critical element in treating anemia is to identify reversible etiologies for the anemia (eg, iron deficiency, infection) and treat these appropriately. Iron deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, and folate deficiency should be evaluated and treated in cases of anemia in elderly persons.\nRed blood cells are also used to treat people with certain types of cancer and sickle cell anemia. Because red blood cells are so essential, they are the most needed blood component. During a Double Red Blood Cell (DRBC) donation, we take just your red blood cells, returning your platelets and plasma.ed blood cells are absolutely essential in emergency situations, especially red blood cells that are type O and B. These red blood cells can mean the difference between life and death for trauma victims and those undergoing surgery.\nFor example, red blood cells are transfused to patients who have lost blood due to trauma or surgery, and to treat anemia (including sickle cell anemia). Cancer patients need platelet transfusions to replace the healthy cells that are destroyed during chemotherapy and radiation.\nThe goal of treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. This is done by raising the red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin level. (Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body.) Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the anemia.\nThe more red blood cells present in the body, the more oxygen and nutrients can be carried to various vital organs for proper functioning. A decrease in hematocrit indicates less delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vital organs. 1  Blood transfusions.2  Hematocrit levels can increase when red blood cells increase. 3  Blood transfusions can replace any blood loss in the body and it can raise the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s red blood cell count, elevating hematocrit levels. Supplementing the body with iron can help increase the blood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to carry oxygen and supply the body with oxygen. 2  Address the cause of bleeding. 3  Any bleeding from the body, external or internal, has to be treated or addressed to avoid further decrease in the hematocrit levels.\nAnemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen.Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.reatment: Procedures.

Only take iron if your doctor has told you to. Do not treat yourself with iron if you are feeling tired.\nAnemia is the name applied to many different conditions that are all characterized by an abnormally low number of healthy red blood cells. There are many different causes and types of anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is usually treated with dietary changes and iron supplement pills.Other types of anemia, such as those associated with chronic diseases or cancer, may need more aggressive treatment.ost cases of anemia are mild, including those that occur as a result of chronic disease. Nevertheless, even mild anemia can reduce oxygen transport in the blood, causing fatigue and a diminished physical capacity. Moderate-to-severe iron-deficiency anemia is known to reduce endurance.\nStinging nettle has been used for hundreds of years to treat painful muscles and joints, eczema, arthritis, gout, and anemia. Today, many people use it to treat urinary problems during the early stages of an enlarged prostate (called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH).\nVitamin deficiency anemia can occur if you don't eat enough folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin C. Or vitamin deficiency anemia can occur if your body has trouble absorbing or processing these vitamins. Not all anemias are caused by a vitamin deficiency. Other causes include iron deficiency and certain blood diseases.That's why it's important to have your doctor diagnose and treat your anemia.

Anemia Caused by Blood Loss If you suddenly lose a large volume of blood, you may be treated with fluids, a blood transfusion, oxygen, and possibly iron to help your body build new red blood cells.\nAll are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the mild anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems. What Causes Anemia? There are more than 400 types of anemia, which are divided into three groups: Anemia caused by blood loss; Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production; Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells Anemia Caused by Blood Loss\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. An increase in blood oxygen temporarily restores normal levels of blood gases and tissue function to promote healing and fight infection.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat several medical conditions.And medical institutions use it in different ways.

Anemia from multiple myeloma may cause weakness, shortness of breath and dizziness. Decreased red blood cell count is present in approximately 60% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Anemia may be treated with supplements, medications, or transfusions.\nTreating underlying causes of iron deficiency. If iron supplements don't increase your blood-iron levels, it's likely the anemia is due to a source of bleeding or an iron-absorption problem that your doctor will need to investigate and treat.Depending on the cause, iron deficiency anemia treatment may involve:f iron supplements don't increase your blood-iron levels, it's likely the anemia is due to a source of bleeding or an iron-absorption problem that your doctor will need to investigate and treat.

Vitamin B12 is used for treating and preventing vitamin B12 deficiency, a condition in which vitamin B12 levels in the blood are too low. It is also used to treat pernicious anemia, a serious type of anemia that is due to vitamin B12 deficiency and is found mostly in older people.For this purpose, people use either a supplement that is taken by mouth or a gel that is applied inside the nose. Injecting vitamin B12 as a shot, as well as taking through the nose or by mouth, is effective for treating low red blood cell counts caused by poor absorption of vitamin B12. 2  Vitamin B12 deficiency. 3  Taking vitamin B12 by mouth, through the nose, or as a shot is effective for treating vitamin B12 deficiency.\nIt can also be made in a laboratory.

The type of treatment a person receives depends on how severe the thalassemia is. The more severe the thalassemia, the less hemoglobin the body has, and the more severe the anemia may be. One way to treat anemia is to provide the body with more red blood cells to carry oxygen.\nFolic acid is a type of B vitamin that is normally found in foods such as dried beans, peas, lentils, oranges, whole-wheat products, liver, asparagus, beets, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and spinach. Folic acid helps your body produce and maintain new cells, and also helps prevent changes to DNA that may lead to cancer.As a medication, folic acid is used to treat folic acid deficiency and certain types of anemia (lack of red blood cells) caused by folic acid deficiency.Folic acid is sometimes used in combination with other medications to treat pernicious anemia.However, folic acid will not treat Vitamin B12 deficiency and will not prevent possible damage to the spinal cord. Take all of your medications as directed.olic acid helps your body produce and maintain new cells, and also helps prevent changes to DNA that may lead to cancer. As a medication, folic acid is used to treat folic acid deficiency and certain types of anemia (lack of red blood cells) caused by folic acid deficiency.\nTreatment of anemia due to crohn's disease is focused on treating or managing the underlying cause of anemia and providing supplements to treat the anemia. Severity and cause of your anemia determines the therapy that your doctor will advise. low hemoglobin level may indicate Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and is quite often seen in crohn's disease. If the CBC results confirm that you have anemia, your doctor may order additional tests to determine the cause, severity, and correct treatment for your condition.\n1. Fruits. Fruits such as iron-rich apples and tomatoes are great to eat when treating anemia. You can either eat apples or tomatoes or drink 100% pure apple and tomato juice to treat anemia.Also fruits that effectively treat anemia are plums, bananas, lemons, grapes, raisins, oranges, figs, carrots and raisins when eaten in large quantities. 2.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: In people with this condition, an overactive immune system destroys the body's own red blood cells, causing anemia.\nAnabolic steroids are used for several reasons: 1  To help patients gain weight after a severe illness, injury, or continuing infection. 2  To treat certain types of anemia. 3  To treat certain kinds of breast cancer in some women. 4  To treat hereditary angioedema, which causes swelling of the face, arms, legs, throat, windpipe, bowels, or sexual organs.\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. An increase in blood oxygen temporarily restores normal levels of blood gases and tissue function to promote healing and fight infection. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat several medical conditions. And medical institutions use it in different ways. Your doctor may suggest hyperbaric oxygen therapy if you have one of the following conditions: 1  Anemia, severe. 2  Brain abscess.  Bubbles of air in your blood vessels (arterial gas embolism)\nThe goals of treating anemia are to provide supportive care while waiting for the bone marrow to kick back in ( in cases of regenerative anemia ) ; to control bleeding and restore blood volume and red blood cell numbers ( in cases of blood loss anemia ) ; to identify and resolve the underlying causes of chronic blood loss ( iron deficiency , ...\nThese cells carry oxygen around the body. If the number of red blood cells is low you may be tired and breathless. Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel like this. If you are very anaemic, you may need a drip to give you extra red blood cells (blood transfusion). clot can cause symptoms such as pain, redness and swelling in a leg, breathlessness and chest pain. Contact your doctor straight away if you have any of these symptoms. A blood clot is serious but your doctor can treat it with drugs that thin the blood. Your doctor or nurse can give you more information.\nIf blood tests indicate kidney disease as the most likely cause of anemia, treatment can include injections of a genetically engineered form of EPO. Many people with kidney disease need iron supplements and EPO to raise their red blood cell count to a level that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions.\nIt can also be made in a laboratory. Vitamin B12 is used for treating and preventing vitamin B12 deficiency, a condition in which vitamin B12 levels in the blood are too low.

This medicine is not for treating anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy.\nBlood transfusions are a simple way of treating anaemia. A blood transfusion involves having blood from carefully screened donors. The transfusion increases the number of red blood cells in your blood, which means that more oxygen can be carried around the body to the tissues and organs.\nEnlarged red blood cells can be caused by a many different factors. The most common are Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid deficiencies. These two vitamins are critical for blood cell production and when the body doesn't have enough of them the cells enlarge. This is treated with vitamin supplementation. Another cause of enlarged blood cells is a hereditary condition called hereditary spherocytosis. This can cause anemia and an enlarged spleen. The treatment for this condition is having your spleen removed.\nTreatment for iron-deficiency anemia will depend on its cause and severity. Treatments may include dietary changes and supplements, medicines, and surgery. Severe iron-deficiency anemia may require a blood transfusion, iron injections, or intravenous (IV) iron therapy. Treatment may need to be done in a hospital. The goals of treating iron-deficiency anemia are to treat its underlying cause and restore normal levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and iron.\nAnemia treatment depends on the cause. Iron deficiency anemia. Treatment for this form of anemia usually involves taking iron supplements and making changes to your diet. If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood \u00e2\u0080\u0094 other than from menstruation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped.\nChlorella is a type of freshwater algae that is known for its dense nutrient content. Although it is widely used in Japan for its potential for treating various health conditions, current research does not support the use of chlorella for treating or preventing any diseases in humans.hlorella may have uses for both pregnant and breast-feeding women. The American Cancer Society notes that supplementing with 6 grams of chlorella per day can be effective in preventing anemia, a common symptom of pregnancy.\nA red blood cell transfusion is safe, and a common way to treat anemia in people with cancer. It raises the level of hemoglobin quickly to improve symptoms, help the patient feel better, and make sure that enough oxygen is getting to vital organs. The need for a blood transfusion depends on how bad your symptoms are and your hemoglobin level.\nABSTRACT: Anemia, common in people with cancer, can be due to the disease itself or to the associated therapy. Fatigue, the most prevalent of all symptoms experienced by cancer patients, is the primary symptom of anemia.Caused by many factors, fatigue, regardless of etiology, has an adverse impact on health-related quality of life.Anemia is among the more treatable of those causes. Prior to the development of recombinant human erythropoietin, red blood cell transfusion was the standard treatment for cancer-related anemia.aused by many factors, fatigue, regardless of etiology, has an adverse impact on health-related quality of life.

This level can typically be achieved by incorporating different dietary supplements and natural remedies into your everyday routine.Blackstrap molasses, chlorophyll, and beetroot are three of the most effective treatment options.he goal for treating anemia is rebuilding the supply of red blood cells in the body. This level can typically be achieved by incorporating different dietary supplements and natural remedies into your everyday routine.\nIn some types of hemolytic anemia, such as thalassemias, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make may be destroyed before their normal lifespan is over. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may be used to treat these types of hemolytic anemia.lood transfusions are used to treat severe or life-threatening hemolytic anemia. A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\nHow Is Hemolytic Anemia Treated? Treatments for hemolytic anemia include blood transfusions, medicines, plasmapheresis (PLAZ-meh-feh-RE-sis), surgery, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and lifestyle changes.
