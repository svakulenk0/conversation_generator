Others with more severe cases need regular blood transfusions to treat  anemia  and other symptoms. They also may require surgery in early years to repair the abnormalities they were born with or else physical and occupational therapy to help live with terminal transverse limbs. The only way to get alpha thalassemia abnormal morphogenesis is by inheriting it from his or her parents from their genes. Humans are made up of trillions of  cells  that form the structure of our bodies and carry out specialized jobs like taking  nutrients  from  food  and turning them into  energy.  Red blood cells, which contain  hemoglobin  deliver  oxygen  to all parts of the body. All cells have a  nucleus  at their center which is kind of like a  brain  or command post of the  cell. The  nucleus  directs the  cell  telling it to grow, mature, divide, or die. The  nucleus  contains  DNA  otherwise known as  Deoxyribonucleic acid, a long spiral shaped  molecule  that stores the genes that determine hair color, eye color, whether or not the person is right or left handed, and many more traits.  DNA, along with other genes and the information they contain, is passed down from parents to their children during reproduction. Each  cell  has many  DNA  molecules, but because cells are very small and  DNA  molecules are long, the  DNA  is packaged very tightly in each  cell. These packages of  DNA  are calls chromosomes, and each cell has 46 of them each package is arranged into 23 pairs with one of each pair coming from the mother and on from the father. When a child has alpha thalassemia, there is a change in chromosome 16.  Alpha globin is made on  chromosome  16 so if any  gene  that tells  chromosome  16 to produce alpha globin is missing or mutated, less  hemoglobin  is made.

House finds it surprising that Jeff admitted he is taking illegal enhancement drugs. He agreed to blood doping, which is common among cyclists, to better one's athletic performance. Because red blood cells carry oxygen between the lungs and the muscles, a higher number of red blood cells can increase an athlete\u2019s endurance. While trying to figure out what cause of Jeff\u2019s respiratory distress, they find an embolus in his chest. While Dr. Chase works to remove the air bubble, Jeff begins to feel numbness in his legs, but is told that it might be due to the sedation. While his manager talks to the press, Jeff loses feeling in his legs. Dr. Cameron informs House that Jeff\u2019s red blood count is continually dropping, revealing that his body is no longer able to produce red blood cells on its own. House becomes convinced that Jeff might have lied about a specific drug that could be the cause of all of his symptoms, Erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced in the kidney that promotes the formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Adding more blood cells increases the oxygen level in the blood, thus presumably causing all of Jeff's symptoms as he fails to produce red blood cells on his own. Which is explanation for him also having anemia, caused by a chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), probably resulting from his use of blood doping. After responding to a Prednisone treatment, Jeff began losing more red blood cells to the point of requiring a transfusion. House scans Jeff's neck and a Thymoma is discovered; an extremely rare tumor on the thymus, confirming that he wasn\u2019t taking EPO, but he did have Chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia.
