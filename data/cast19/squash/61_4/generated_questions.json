Steve convinces a reluctant  Luke Cage  to be part of the new lineup after  Tony Stark  sells the reconstructed  Avengers Mansion  to Cage for a dollar, and Steve gives Cage carte blanche to maintain the New Avengers team, leading it as he sees fit. Given the freedom to recruit almost anyone he wants for the New Avengers team (except Iron Man or  Thor ), Cage selects  Clint Barton  (who has re-assumed the Hawkeye identity),  Iron Fist, Jewel (Cage's wife  Jessica Jones ),  Ms. Marvel,  Mockingbird,  Spider-Man, the  Thing  (who maintains concurrent membership in the Fantastic Four) and  Wolverine. Rogers also sends him  Victoria Hand  on the grounds that she can provide the team with a unique insight from which Rogers feels they will benefit. Although Hawkeye leaves the team when a crisis comes up with the main Avengers team (claiming that he only joined them to spend time with his wife), the team later enlists a now-weakened  Doctor Strange  after he assists them in tackling a dimensional crisis.  Squirrel Girl  and  Wong  are hired as a super-powered babysitter for Cage's and Jewel's baby and mansion housekeeper respectively, although they don't serve directly on the main lineup of the New Avengers. Spider-Man appears to want to leave the team prior to the  Fear Itself  event due to his distrust of Victoria Hand and his new responsibilities in the  Future Foundation, but subsequent conversations with Wolverine and Luke Cage convince him to remain an active member.

In the four-part \"Spider-Verse\" episodes, the Goblin imprisons Electro in the Siege Perilous as a living power source so he can travel the  Marvel Multiverse  to acquire DNA samples from alternate reality versions of Spider-Man for a'very special purpose'. With Spider-Man pursuing him, he first arrives to  Marvel 2099  to get a blood sample from a  futuristic successor  to Spider-Man, then a gender-swapped universe where he enlists his female counterpart Norma Osborn (voiced by  Wendie Malick ) [based on the original Green Goblin incarnation] to help with  Spider-Girl  in return for a vial of his Goblin serum for her own use. The Goblin then gets a blood sample from  Spider-Man Noir, a chin-hair from  Spider-Ham, and another blood sample from  Spyder-Knight. The Goblin arrives to  another alternate universe  to get the blood of the  Ultimate Spider-Man  while finding himself attacked by  a winged, demonic Green Goblin  (also voiced by Steven Weber). During all this, he finally figures out his nemesis's identity via that world's  Peter Parker's gravestone. He then pools all of the alternate Spider-Men DNA into a serum to gain spider-like abilities, engaging in a winning fight with Spider-Man while bragging about knowing the web-slinger's secret identity. The Goblin joyfully threatens Peter's  loved ones, however, Spider-Man tries to deter Osborn from his own son's harm, but the Goblin no longer sees himself as Norman, angrily stating that love is a weakness and that he 'loves no one'. Just then, the serum further mutates him, transforming into the  Spider-Goblin. The even more deranged Spider-Goblin battles the Web-Warriors until Spider-Man manages to turns him back to his human form again with Electro's help. Norman is later seen in a retirement home after he lost his memories as Goblin (and Spider-Man's identity), happily greeting Peter and Harry as the two youths come to visit him. The Green Goblin also appears in the episode \"A Nightmare on Christmas\". In an alternate reality that Peter gave up being Spider-Man to be rich, the Goblin now rules New York with his own army of Spider-Soldiers as personal enforcers. At the bigger and threatening Oscorp tower, Spider-Man encounters a horned, suited version that now calls himself the Goblin King. Having defeated and killed most of the Earth's heroes, he has the  Avengers'equipment as trophies (i.e.  Iron Man's  armor,  Black Widow's gauntlets,  Captain America's  shield,  Falcon's wings, and even  Thor's  Mjolnir ). After an intense battle, Spider-Man defeats the Goblin King before learning this reality is actually  Nightmare's illusion. In the four-part \"Contests of Champions\" season finale, Norman can be occasionally seen as one of the people held hostage as Spider-Man's motivation for the 'game' between the  Collector  and the  Grandmaster.", "qas": [{"id": "question_1109", "question": "What is the Green Goblin?", "answers": [{"text": "The Green Goblin returns in Ultimate Spider-Man: Web-Warriors.", "answer_start": 0}],

His first actions were to shut down Weapon X and resurrect the  Super Soldier  program, commissioning Richard Parker, Dr. Bruce Banner, Franklin Storm, and young intern Hank Pym to try to recreate the formula that made  Captain America. This failed and resulted in the creation of the Hulk when Banner injected his serum into himself. It was later revealed that the chemical called Oz, which turned Norman Osborn into the  Green Goblin, was also created in hopes of recreating the Super Soldier formula.  Spider-Man  was also a product of the Oz formula. Also, the creation of the supervillains  Sandman  and  Electro  are due to  Hammer Industries  attempting to recreate the Super Soldier formula for S.H.I.E.L.D. Then S.H.I.E.L.D. created its own superhero team, the  Ultimates. Later still, it brought the  X-Men  and  Spider-Man  under S.H.I.E.L.D. jurisdiction. In Ultimate X-Men #65 (Jan. 2006), S.H.I.E.L.D. severed ties with the X-Men. After the events of  Ultimate Power, S.H.I.E.L.D. is under the directorship of  Carol Danvers, as Nick Fury was temporarily stranded in the  Supreme Power  Universe. After \"Ultimatum\", Nick Fury becomes head of the Black-Ops division in  Ultimate Comics: Avengers. It is also revealed he is plotting to take back his position as director. After a mysterious force frames Danvers for selling super-soldiers to rival nations, it was revealed to be a ploy by  Gregory Stark  to become Director, until Fury, the Avengers, and Ultimates stop him, resulting in Thor electrocuting Dr. Stark to death. After the  Death of Spider-Man,  Marvin Flumm  was promoted to Director by the  U.S. President. After an arc called \"Divided We Stand\", a crossover involving  Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man,  Ultimate Comics: X-Men, and  Ultimate Comics: Ultimates,  Monica Chang  (one of Nick Fury's ex-wives and 2nd  Black Widow ) was promoted by Captain America to Director after Agent Flumm was dismissed.
