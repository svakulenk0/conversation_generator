The team will have a diverse roster consisting of  Luke Cage , the  Superior Spider-Man ,  Falcon ,  Power Man ,  White Tiger ,  Blue Marvel ,  Monica Rambeau ,  She-Hulk , and a new  Ronin .\nNot long after she was given the identity of Spider-Woman, she was drawn into the first  Secret Wars , where she met Spider-Man and the Avengers for the first time, and allied herself with the superhuman champions.  She battled the  Absorbing Man ,  Doctor Doom , and the  Hulk . She was killed and resurrected by Doom with the power of the  Beyonder . After returning to Earth, Julia joined  Freedom Force  (a government-sponsored super team made up primarily of former members of the  Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  who enlisted into government service to avoid prison terms). In an early mission with Freedom Force, the team was sent to arrest the  X-Men . During this conflict with the X-Men, Julia also began to question her teammates' exceedingly brutal attitudes that they held over from their criminal pasts. Subsequently Freedom Force was sent to arrest the  Avengers  after a disgruntled  Quicksilver  made false accusations against them. Freedom Force actually defeated the combined East and  West Coast Avengers  teams and helped bring the Avengers into custody at the  Vault  without a trial. Spider-Woman once again found her loyalties divided; she had a change of heart and eventually chose to aid the Avengers by breaking into the Vault and freeing them, battling the  Guardsmen  and thus becoming a fugitive from the law herself. While on the run from the law she teamed up with Spider-Man occasionally.  In another adventure she also teamed with  Iron Man , to battle renegade  A.I.M.  agents named the Seekers, who sought to capture Valerie Cooper to undercover solo work.

Alongside Spider-Man, she battled the  Wrecking Crew  as a government assignment.\nAfter Agamotto's take over, the New Avengers (now made of Doctor Strange, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Ms. Marvel, Jessica Jones, Victoria Hand, and Iron Fist) discuss team structure, and Victoria Hand tells them that Steve Rogers is paying them. Luke is skeptical at first, until Jessica tells him that they are low on money. The only one unable to be paid is Spider-Man, who has not revealed his identity yet. Meanwhile, Jessica and Luke hire Squirrel Girl with their newfound money as their nanny, and Wong moves in with the New Avengers. While Luke Cage and Jessica Jones are out on a 'date' to discuss Jessica's future role in the team, they are attacked by a Doombot which the rest of the team only just manages to stop, Victoria Hand mentioning that the other Avengers teams are concerned about this development but unable to reveal more due to Spider-Man's unknown identity preventing her from sharing such confidential information with him.\nScott drew a  Raven  miniseries for DC Comics.

The  Decepticon  leader  Megatron  is using one of  Doctor Doom 's devices to control human minds.  Optimus Prime  and his  Autobots  attack Latveria with the other Avengers. The Decepticons use Spider-Man's blood to gain even more power than what Energon, their normal source of energy, gives them. After the Autobots free Spider-Man, he and Wolverine agree to give their blood samples to the Autobots so they can be on equal ground with the Decepticons. Iron Man's armor is destroyed in the battle, but the Autobots win the war. After both teams of robots leave, the Avengers disclose to the government what happened.\nAfter Ultimatum, the  Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars  mini-series featured Iron Man racing across the world to find his stolen armor in order to save the remains of his enterprise.

Steve convinces a reluctant  Luke Cage  to be part of the new lineup after  Tony Stark  sells the reconstructed  Avengers Mansion  to Cage for a dollar, and Steve gives Cage carte blanche to maintain the New Avengers team, leading it as he sees fit. Given the freedom to recruit almost anyone he wants for the New Avengers team (except Iron Man or  Thor ), Cage selects  Clint Barton  (who has re-assumed the Hawkeye identity),  Iron Fist , Jewel (Cage's wife  Jessica Jones ),  Ms. Marvel ,  Mockingbird ,  Spider-Man , the  Thing  (who maintains concurrent membership in the Fantastic Four) and  Wolverine . Rogers also sends him  Victoria Hand  on the grounds that she can provide the team with a unique insight from which Rogers feels they will benefit. Although Hawkeye leaves the team when a crisis comes up with the main Avengers team (claiming that he only joined them to spend time with his wife), the team later enlists a now-weakened  Doctor Strange  after he assists them in tackling a dimensional crisis.  Squirrel Girl  and  Wong  are hired as a super-powered babysitter for Cage's and Jewel's baby and mansion housekeeper respectively, although they do not serve directly on the main lineup of the New Avengers. Spider-Man appears to want to leave the team prior to the  Fear Itself  event due to his distrust of Victoria Hand and his new responsibilities in the  Future Foundation , but subsequent conversations with Wolverine and Luke Cage convince him to remain an active member. After Fear Itself, the team lineup shifts, initially with the addition of  Daredevil  to the team and later with Jessica Jones leaving the team out of fear for her baby Danielle's safety.\nHe appeared as a regular character in the Dark Avengers series from issue #1 (March 2009) through issue #16 (June 2010), as well as the mini-series \"Siege\", which saw Norman being arrested for the crimes committed by him following the events of Civil War storyline. At this point, the character was officially reclassified as an Avengers villain and only made three minor appearances in Amazing Spider-Man. The first was \"Brand New Ways To Die\", which ran from Amazing Spider-Man #570-573 and featured Norman and the Thunderbolts versus Spider-Man and the original Venom. His second appearance was Amazing Spider-Man #580, which explained that, following  Mephisto 's alteration of Spider-Man's past, Norman's return was significantly altered. He had returned earlier than he had originally returned and that he had arranged for his son Harry's death to be faked with help from  Mysterio , due to his concern for his son's mental well being after once again became the Green Goblin. His final appearance was in Amazing Spider-Man #595-599: in this storyline, Norman attempts to convince his son to become a super-hero so that he can kill him off and exploit his demise. It also revealed that he was sleeping with the super-villain  Menace  (Harry's ex-girlfriend), with Norman believing that the villain's child she was carrying was his.\nUpon the  Skrulls ' defeat,  S.H.I.E.L.D.  is dismantled and replaced by  H.A.M.M.E.R. , a new intelligence agency. Norman Osborn (who has been  Spider-Man 's archenemy as the  Green Goblin ) is placed in control of H.A.M.M.E.R. and the  Thunderbolts , while assembling a team of  Avenger imposters  composed of supervillains. Meanwhile, the revamped New Avengers roster consists of  Captain America (Bucky Barnes) ,  Luke Cage ,  Ronin ,  Mockingbird ,  Ms. Marvel , Spider-Man, the real  Spider-Woman  and  Wolverine . Captain America offers these \"new  Avengers\" his home as a base of operations.  Iron Fist  announces he must leave the group to attend to personal business, but will remain on call. The team elects Ronin as leader (with Ms. Marvel as second-in-command), and persuades Spider-Man to once again reveal his secret identity to his fellow members.\nA despondent Hercules helps the  Shi'ar  warrior  Deathcry  return to her homeworld, and on returning to Earth is devastated to learn that the Avengers - and the  Fantastic Four  - have apparently sacrificed themselves to stop the entity known as  Onslaught , although they have really been sent into a pocket universe. Hercules briefly joins the commercial superhero team  Heroes for Hire , and travels to Greece with Spider-Man to meet the threat of Dr. Zeus. He eventually reunites with his Avenger comrades, aiding the team against  Morgan Le Fey . before choosing to remain an inactive member.\nThe Shroud later recruits  Spider-Woman  (Jessica Drew) to infiltrate a  S.H.I.E.L.D.  facility so that they can access the files. Alongside Spider-Woman, the Shroud battled the Cult of Kali. Shroud then took on Cat and Mouse as his aides. He then teamed with  Spider-Man  against  Dansen Macabre . The Shroud aided the  Avengers  and  Doctor Strange  against  Morgan le Fay . He helped restore the former Spider-Woman's astral self to her body. He later refused  Hawkeye 's offer to join the  West Coast Avengers . Shroud assisted a depowered Jessica Drew against some crooks. He assisted the West Coast Avengers against  Graviton  and the  Blank .\nAs Iron Man and Megatron face off outside the base, the Autobots track down Spider-Man, subsequently freeing him with the aid of Doctor Doom (who has turned on the Decepticons after they betrayed him). Realizing that the Decepticons are too powerful to take on as they are, the Autobots ask for Spider-Man and Wolverine's permission to use the same energy-enhancement method that the Decepticons used, taking blood samples from the two and using it to enhance their own abilities, and the two heroes agree to the procedure. While Spider-Man joins the Autobots outside the ship, Wolverine and Doctor Doom track down the device that initially amplified the Avengers' aggression and Wolverine destroys it, leaving Doom to make his own way out as he rejoins his teammates. Although Iron Man's Transformer armor is destroyed after it suffers an overload while fighting Megatron, the Autobots are still able to turn the tide, thanks to their power boost Spider-Man and Luke Cage knocking down Megatron and forcing him to flee. With the other Decepticons and the Autobots subsequently departing themselves, the Avengers are left to report to the government about the situation. Meanwhile, the Autobots reports that  Ramjet  has gone to earth and it is implied that he has taken the form of the Avengers Quinjet.\nBy the end of the first volume, the New Avengers team consisted of  Ronin ,  Captain America (Bucky Barnes) ,  Mockingbird ,  Ms. Marvel ,  Spider-Man ,  Spider-Woman  (Drew),  Wolverine , and team leader  Luke Cage . Writer Brian Michael Bendis said in an interview that these characters are the authentic Avengers because Captain America said they were. This statement is repeated when the team, believing Captain America (Rogers) is alive, attempts to rescue him. Spider-Man claims that if they get Captain America back, they can call themselves Avengers again. Luke Cage contends that they are Avengers already. The series ended with The New Avengers #64 (April 2010), at the conclusion of the \" Siege \" storyline. A one-shot titled The New Avengers: Finale was also released.\nSuperior Spider-Man is seen fighting Smythe and is mocking him for being weak in comparison to his father  Spencer Smythe . When Superior Spider-Man says that he has called the Avengers for backup, Smythe states that he has his own backup as Boomerang, Scorpion, and Vulture show up. Superior Spider-Man admits that the Mini-Slayers were clever but inadvertently reveals that his countermeasures are being powered by the Raft's Power Generators distracting him at the revelation. Smythe takes the upper hand until he is narrowly shot down by Mayor Jameson disguised as a Raft guard. Superior Spider-Man hunts Smythe through his comm system only to discover that he did the same trick and informed his allies (all heading for a full front assault against Superior Spider-Man) who tries to convince them that Smythe is using them and will take back their enhancements once he has out. All of them agree that even though that might happen, they will make the best of the situation against him. Smythe manages to reach the Raft's generators, destroying them to shut down the power in the entire island, allowing the  Lizard  to escape. Once Smythe tries to escape, Superior Spider-Man reminds him about the emergency generators. Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that just like he does with his Spider-Bots, he can see through his Mini-Slayers catching up on Mayor Jameson and the trapped civilians sending their locations to the group. Scorpion rejects it at first, but is easily convinced once Smythe tells him that one of his targets is Mayor Jameson himself. After Boomerang is defeated, Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that he is still caught in a predicament since Scorpion is heading to his personal vengeance against Jameson and Vulture is ready to kill the group of civilians so he must make a choice only to be surprised when Superior Spider-Man replies that he will not follow any of them. Instead, Superior Spider-Man determined to complete his mission of slaying him.\nSpider-Man is a featured playable character in  Marvel: Ultimate Alliance  voiced by  Quinton Flynn .

Flash infiltrates and attacks Crime Master and his men until the  Superior Spider-Man  (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) and his Spiderlings intervene. Crime Master then reveals himself to be a small-time hood who had purchased the name and mask from Hobgoblin and turns himself in. Superior Spider-Man then turns his attention to Agent Venom with the intent on destroying him. Flash escapes in a puff of smoke and hides in a hospital before going to Peter's apartment. Seizing opportunity, \"Peter Parker\" invites Flash to his company to give Flash prosthetic legs. After doing so, Superior Spider-Man detains the symbiote in a cage from which it soon breaks free and bonds to Superior Spider-Man, becoming the Superior Venom. The symbiote tries to flee back to Flash, but Superior Spider-Man keeps it for himself, even going as far as to injure Cardiac when Cardiac tries to separate them.  Iron Man  arrives to Parker Industries to assist both Cardiac and Flash in order to take him to the battle-zone and reunite him with the symbiote. The Avengers are starting to fall against the power of Superior Venom who boasts about his superiority until Iron Man arrives to distract him allowing Flash (wearing Iron Man's armor) attack from behind and attempt to retake the symbiote. With the unexpected assistance from Spider-Man's conscience, the Venom symbiote finally leaves Superior Spider-Man's body and reunites with Flash, bonding together again. The Avengers are still in disbelief about Superior Spider-Man's argument until they ask Flash to check his mind-link with the symbiote to see anything wrong about Superior Spider-Man's motives.

This culminates in a battle with Peter Parker (made aware of the recent access to his private fingerprint locked lab), after which he's forcefully submerged in the pool of highly concentrated cure. Kaine re-emerges, his mind-link with the Spider Queen broken, a fully healed clone of Peter Parker. Despite the serum somehow curing him of every trace of his former degeneration, including his heavily scarred skin, Kaine claims to have retained his powers and abilities. In the final chapter of Spider-Island Kaine, now fully cured and seemingly a perfect clone in every way Ben Reilly was, helps take down the Spider Queen. Kaine and Peter grab costumes from Peter's lab, Kaine opting for the sonic-shield \" Big Time \" outfit as the two head off. While Peter goes to the Empire State Building with Mary Jane to cure New York, Kaine stays behind with the Avengers to fight the Spider Queen. As Peter weakens the Spider Queen, Kaine and Ms. Marvel attempt a move that she had originally perfected with Spider-Man. She swings Kaine by a web and launches him at the Spider Queen. Kaine turns on his sonic-shield to protect himself from the Spider Queen's sonic scream as stingers (like Peter's from The Other arc) erupt from his arms and he goes through her throat, delivering the killing blow. The Other powers were confirmed in a conversation between Peter and Kaine, which Kaine said that \"he died and came back with all these new powers\" that Peter confirmed he had been there and done that. After the battle, Kaine evades the other heroes during the aftermath of the battle using the suit, but  Madame Web  is able to 'see' him regardless, and talks to him about his future. Kaine meets up with Peter at the airport where he is seeing off Aunt May, unmasked and free of his former degeneration only looking slightly more disheveled and taller, much like Ben Reilly was in the Lost Years arc. Kaine informs Peter he is leaving New York, and that he is keeping the stealth suit due to Madame Web's advice.\nThe first three Spider-Man films set new opening day records in North America in their opening weekend.

Despite Spider-Man leaving the  Avengers  in  Shattered Heroes , the members of the team are  supporting character s. The story was written by  Dan Slott  and brings storylines that have been running since issue #600 was released in July  2009  to fruition. Marvel released several preview images for the event, and has written an article about why each current member of the Sinister Six is important for this group.\nPublished by Marvel Comics since 2011, the series follows Spider-Man supporting character  Flash Thompson  (who debuted as the latest Venom, an agent of the United States military bonded with the symbiote, in the February 2011 The Amazing Spider-Man #654).

In the four-part \"Spider-Verse\" episodes, the Goblin imprisons Electro in the Siege Perilous as a living power source so he can travel the  Marvel Multiverse  to acquire DNA samples from alternate reality versions of Spider-Man for a 'very special purpose'. With Spider-Man pursuing him, he first arrives to  Marvel 2099  to get a blood sample from a  futuristic successor  to Spider-Man, then a gender-swapped universe where he enlists his female counterpart Norma Osborn (voiced by  Wendie Malick ) [based on the original Green Goblin incarnation] to help with  Spider-Girl  in return for a vial of his Goblin serum for her own use. The Goblin then gets a blood sample from  Spider-Man Noir , a chin-hair from  Spider-Ham , and another blood sample from  Spyder-Knight . The Goblin arrives to  another alternate universe  to get the blood of the  Ultimate Spider-Man  while finding himself attacked by  a winged, demonic Green Goblin  (also voiced by Steven Weber). During all this, he finally figures out his nemesis's identity via that world's  Peter Parker 's gravestone. He then pools all of the alternate Spider-Men DNA into a serum to gain spider-like abilities, engaging in a winning fight with Spider-Man while bragging about knowing the web-slinger's secret identity. The Goblin joyfully threatens Peter's  loved ones , however, Spider-Man tries to deter Osborn from his own son's harm, but the Goblin no longer sees himself as Norman, angrily stating that love is a weakness and that he 'loves no one'. Just then, the serum further mutates him, transforming into the  Spider-Goblin . The even more deranged Spider-Goblin battles the Web-Warriors until Spider-Man manages to turns him back to his human form again with Electro's help. Norman is later seen in a retirement home after he lost his memories as Goblin (and Spider-Man's identity), happily greeting Peter and Harry as the two youths come to visit him. The Green Goblin also appears in the episode \"A Nightmare on Christmas\". In an alternate reality that Peter gave up being Spider-Man to be rich, the Goblin now rules New York with his own army of Spider-Soldiers as personal enforcers. At the bigger and threatening Oscorp tower, Spider-Man encounters a horned, suited version that now calls himself the Goblin King. Having defeated and killed most of the Earth's heroes, he has the  Avengers ' equipment as trophies (i.e.  Iron Man 's  armor ,  Black Widow 's gauntlets,  Captain America 's  shield ,  Falcon 's wings, and even  Thor 's  Mjolnir ). After an intense battle, Spider-Man defeats the Goblin King before learning this reality is actually  Nightmare 's illusion. In the four-part \"Contests of Champions\" season finale, Norman can be occasionally seen as one of the people held hostage as Spider-Man's motivation for the 'game' between the  Collector  and the  Grandmaster .\nWhen Norman Osborn reclaimed ownership of  H.A.M.M.E.R. , he manages to locate Ai Apaec and recruit him to his latest incarnation of the  Dark Avengers  alongside  Barney Barton ,  Gorgon , June Covington,  Skaar , and  Superia . To make Ai Apaec his latest  Spider-Man , Norman Osborn gives Ai Apaec a genetic-modifying drug that alters his appearance to resemble a six-armed version of the black suit Spider-Man. Ai Apaec and the other members of the Dark Avengers are defeated by both Avengers teams when it turns out that his teammate Skaar was the Avengers' double-agent. Ai Apaec's drug wore off and  Captain America  knocked him unconscious.\nJessica is then paired with  Spider-Man  to do reconnaissance on Avengers Tower, where she reveals to him she is an agent of S.W.O.R.D. The duo are then found by Mandrill and Griffin who proceed to attack them. During the fight Mandrill gets close enough to Jessica and controls her into attacking Spider-Man. Spider-Man appears to be on the losing end of the fight but manages to lure Jessica away from Mandrill and the effects of his control begin to wear off. The duo trick Mandrill and Griffin into thinking Jessica has beaten Spider-Man and when they approach Spider-Woman to give her new commands, Jessica punches Mandrill in the face and shoves her hand in his mouth, firing off a venom blast and knocking him out. Furious, Jessica wants to kill both villains for what they have done but is stopped by Spider-Man. The duo heads back to the safehouse where they head off with the Avengers to help the  Asgardians . Upon arriving in Asgard, Jessica and the rest of the heroes engage  Iron Patriot 's forces and witnesses the insane  Sentry 's defeat.\nWhen the  New Avengers  were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday \"for the first time in years\", having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed. Jarvis often confronts  Wolverine  over the man's poor kitchen etiquette, a battle only new member  Spider-Man 's  Aunt May  was able to win. Jarvis seemingly struck up a relationship with May that had moved into  Stark Tower  with Peter Parker and  Mary Jane Watson  after her house burnt down. When Spider-Man switched sides during the Civil War, however, May and Mary Jane fled Stark Tower to live in hiding. In a New Avengers  Civil War  story, Jarvis was shot by an employee who was opposed to Tony Stark using technology invented to enforce the  Superhuman Registration Act . However, it appears Jarvis recovers from this wound as he is shown to be working again in  Civil War: The Initiative . He also humorously mentions that if Stark allowed \"that Tigra %^#$\" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry;  Tigra  had worked for Stark's side throughout the entirety of the Civil War incident. In the 2008 storyline  One More Day , Jarvis is given over $2,000,000 by Stark to pay for May's hospital bills following an assassination attempt in the aftermath of Peter's own decision to publicly reveal Spider-Man's true identity. Jarvis visibly breaks down upon seeing May in the hospital bed, confessing his deep love to the Parkers. As a consequence of the \"One More Day\" storyline, however, Spider-Man's timeline has undergone a major continuity overhaul, including Jarvis's relationship with the Parkers.\nIn the third season, Spider-Man officially joins the  Avengers , but after a fight with  Loki , Doctor Octopus and a group of Norse creatures bonded with the Venom symbiote, he chooses to resign and remain with S.H.I.E.L.D. After this, the symbiote permanently bonds with  Flash Thompson  to become Agent Venom and Spider-Man is tasked by Nick Fury to recruit other young heroes to form the  New Warriors . At the same time, Green Goblin hires  Taskmaster  to find the young heroes before Spider-Man does and form the  Thunderbolts . Spider-Man manages to recruit  Ka-Zar  and his pet  smilodon   Zabu  from the  Savage Land , and  Amadeus Cho  in the  Iron Spider  armor, while Taskmaster recruits  Cloak and Dagger  and  Vulture . When the Thunderbolts attempt to bust out Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Beetle and Scorpion, Spider-Man leads the New Warriors against the group, and is able to convince Cloak and Dagger to switch sides. The New Warriors ultimately defeat the villains, but Green Goblin gets away with the  Siege Perilous , leading to a variation of the  Spider-Verse  storyline in which he travels across the multiverse to collect DNA samples of Spider-Man's alternate counterparts to turn himself into the Spider-Goblin. Chasing after him, Spider-Man meets up with  Spider-Man 2099 ,  Spider-Girl ,  Spider-Man Noir ,  Spider-Ham , Spyder-Knight and  Miles Morales , helping them each one by one with their problems, before teaming up with all of them to take down Spider-Goblin and a giant Helicarrier robot controlled by Electro. After both are defeated and the alternate Spider-Men return to their homes, Goblin reverts into Norman Osborn and ends up suffering amnesia, making him forget his time as the Goblin. Afterwards, Spider-Man and his team begin their education at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy located at the  Triskelion  while dealing with the reawakened  Arnim Zola . Not long afterwards, Spider-Man gets involved in a contest between the  Collector  and the  Grandmaster  for the fate of Earth. During this time,  Aunt May , Agent Venom, and Iron Spider learn of Spider-Man's identity.\nAfter Ross stepped down and retired,  Nick Fury  was then selected as the organization's  executive director . His first actions were to shut down Weapon X and resurrect the  Super Soldier  program, commissioning Richard Parker, Dr. Bruce Banner, Franklin Storm, and young intern Hank Pym to try to recreate the formula that made  Captain America . This failed and resulted in the creation of the Hulk when Banner injected his serum into himself. It was later revealed that the chemical called Oz, which turned Norman Osborn into the  Green Goblin , was also created in hopes of recreating the Super Soldier formula.  Spider-Man  was also a product of the Oz formula. Also, the creation of the supervillains  Sandman  and  Electro  are due to  Hammer Industries  attempting to recreate the Super Soldier formula for S.H.I.E.L.D. Then S.H.I.E.L.D. created its own superhero team, the  Ultimates . Later still, it brought the  X-Men  and  Spider-Man  under S.H.I.E.L.D. jurisdiction. In Ultimate X-Men #65 (Jan. 2006), S.H.I.E.L.D. severed ties with the X-Men. After the events of  Ultimate Power , S.H.I.E.L.D. is under the directorship of  Carol Danvers , as Nick Fury was temporarily stranded in the  Supreme Power  Universe. After \"Ultimatum\", Nick Fury becomes head of the Black-Ops division in  Ultimate Comics: Avengers . It is also revealed he is plotting to take back his position as director. After a mysterious force frames Danvers for selling super-soldiers to rival nations, it was revealed to be a ploy by  Gregory Stark  to become Director, until Fury, the Avengers, and Ultimates stop him, resulting in Thor electrocuting Dr. Stark to death. After the  Death of Spider-Man ,  Marvin Flumm  was promoted to Director by the  U.S. President . After an arc called \"Divided We Stand\", a crossover involving  Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man ,  Ultimate Comics: X-Men , and  Ultimate Comics: Ultimates ,  Monica Chang  (one of Nick Fury's ex-wives and 2nd  Black Widow ) was promoted by Captain America to Director after Agent Flumm was dismissed. S.H.I.E.L.D. is later disassembled after the events of Cataclysm, for although the Ultimates were able to defeat  Galactus , the destruction caused by Galactus's attack and the loss of Captain America and Thor make it the last straw for the United States Government, who immediately decide to shut S.H.I.E.L.D. down, resulting in villains such as  Norman Osborn  (Green Goblin) and  Victor Van Damme  (Doctor Doom), who are revealed to be alive, being released into the custody of other federal agencies.\nCage does not comply with the amnesty offered to the Secret Avengers, going underground and reforming the  New Avengers  alongside  Spider-Man ,  Wolverine ,  Iron Fist , and  Spider-Woman . Luke assumes leadership of the New Avengers after the assassination of Captain America, with the team now operating underground and provided with secure accommodation by  Doctor Strange .\nSpider-Man,  Wolverine , and Spider-Woman are amongst the New Avengers members who answer Hercules' call in his plan to attack his mother Hera on Mount Olympus.\nFollowing the conclusion of The Superior Spider-Man and the return of Peter Parker as Spider-Man, he learns that his friend Flash is Venom and became angry at the Avengers that they did not tell him. The Avengers confess that because Flash was a good soldier and the secret identities in the Avengers' rules goes both ways.\nThere are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes, transferring blame for his shortcomings to others or claiming that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father. Having become the Goblin, he generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the  Human Torch , despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself. He also missed the opportunity to lead the original  Sinister Six  because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted despite Venom being more powerful than the Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual \u2013 which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively \u2013 only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the  Asgardians  wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.\nFollowing the deletion of Peter Parker's memories and acquiring The Raft as his new base which he renamed Spider-Island II, the Superior Spider-Man begins to collect former Sinister Six members and store them in his underwater lab with the implied intention to create a team as the Superior Spider-Man. First, he acquired the sand grain that contained Sandman's consciousness. When Electro returned to Earth after being hurled into space by Thor, the Superior Spider-Man enlisted Thor to help defeat Electro. The Superior Spider-Man then confiscated Chameleon from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. The Superior Spider-Man came across Mysterion (a villain that is dressed like Mysterio) robbing the bank. Upon defeating Mysterion, the Superior Spider-Man discovered that the villain he thought was Mysterio was not Quentin Beck but an unnamed man who bought the Mysterio gear from the Hobgoblin. Finally, the Superior Spider-Man went up against Vulture who seeks to get even with the Superior Spider-Man for beating him up twice. The Superior Spider-Man managed to defeat Vulture.\nSpider-Man is a playable character in the  Facebook  game  Marvel: Avengers Alliance Tactics .\nIn the ongoing series  Ultimate Comics: Avengers , a second Spider-Man was shown to be one of its members, and is simply referred to as the Spider. His costume bears an orange-and-purple color as opposed to red-and-blue. The Spider once claimed that he was a clone made from the DNA of Spider-Man and Professor X that was sent from the future. In the \"Death of Spider-Man\" story arc, \"Avengers vs. New Ultimates\", he is revealed to be North Asian and under the orders of Gregory Stark. He led a superhuman uprising in North Korea. During the events of said uprising, The Spider was killed by Hawkeye after the Avengers and the New Ultimates intervened.\n[[File:Avengers 2010.jpg|thumb|The \"Heroic Age\" roster of the Avengers. Cover art for Avengers vol. 4, #12.1, by  Bryan Hitch .]]The next iteration of the Avengers roster consisted of  Thor ,  Hawkeye ,  Spider-Man ,  Wolverine ,  Captain America ,  Spider-Woman ,  Iron Man , and team leader  Maria Hill .  Steve Rogers , briefly eschewing his Captain America persona, grants these \"New Avengers\" recognition as an official team independent of  Stark's more traditional Avengers. Bucky Barnes as Captain America joined the main Avengers, as did Iron Fist,  Power Woman , and the  Thing . Rogers was an occasional presence and  Victoria Hand  was added with his backing.\nMichael, Van and Patrick's Scarlet Spider suits, a redesign of  Tony Stark 's  Iron Spider  armor (previously used by Spider-Man), are supported by systems similar to that of Stark's classic  Iron Man  design. In the Scarlet Spider's first appearance, Avengers: The Initiative #3, the suit features several devices, including four mechanical spider-arms or \" waldoes \" on each suit, one more than on the original, along with  cloaking  devices and a short-range  GPS  microwave communication system. In Avengers: The Initiative #7, the suits display mechanical  web-shooters  while retaining the ability to change appearance to other versions of the Spider-Man costume or street clothes. In  New Warriors  vol. 4 #15 (October 2008), it was revealed the suits have had their StarkTech removed, which prevented the suits being affected when all StarkTech was made inoperable by Skrull invaders. However, this is seemingly retconned in a line spoken by one of the Spiders: \"should be StarkTech like ours, but it's so alien\", in Avengers: The Initiative #22, when the Spiders interface with other technology.\nAi Apaec and the rest of the Dark Avengers team are thrown into an alternate world with  John Walker . Ai Apaec was shown to have been shrunken down when he is a prisoner in Iron Man's lab. When  Hank Pym  mentions having regrown U.S. Agent's limbs and shrunk Ai Apaec, Iron Man lashes out at him and realizes that Henry Pym's control implant had been reworked. The Dark Avengers make their way through Hell's Kitchen to get to Strangetown. They come across a building covered with webs as Ai Apaec claims that this world's Spider-Man had gone under a profound change to have created a long-lasting web. During the fight between the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang, Ai Apaec tells Barney to load him onto an arrow and fire it at Spider-Man. Spider-Man's Spider-Senses go off and he catches the arrow as Ai Apaec and Spider-Man speak in a different language while the other Dark Avengers have been subdued. With help from Ai Apaec, June Covington tells them that they had poisoned Hawkeye on his left side and that the venom must be sucked out. Later on, the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang arrive in Strangetown where they are attacked by the All-Seeing Eye and the Soulsnake. Ai Apaec tells Spider-Man to cast some webbing and give Barney Barton a sword which he uses to destroy the Soulsnake while Spider-Man lands a hard kick to the All-Seeing Eye. Ai Apaec is climbing on Doctor Strange's leg, telepathically calling the Dark Avengers to summon an object contained by Spider-Man's webs which would grant him the perfect distraction. Enraged at the death of  Clea , Doctor Strange readies an even more powerful spell. Before he can do the spell, Ai Apaec hits him with all the poison he had killing Doctor Strange and ending his slave spell on Moonstone and Skaar. Ai Apaec and the Dark Avengers later return to their reality. When Ai Apaec reminds the Dark Avengers that he must be restored to his proper size, June Covington steps on him.\nA new Avengers team formed, in the series  New Avengers , composed of Iron Man, Captain America,  Luke Cage ,  Wolverine ,  Ronin ,  Spider-Man ,  Spider-Woman , and the  Sentry . This was soon followed by the  House of M  event.\nIron Man, in the series  The Mighty Avengers , formed a team under the aegis of the government's  Fifty State Initiative  program, and took up residency in New York City, joined by  Ares , the  Black Widow , the Sentry, the  Wasp ,  Wonder Man , and leader Carol Danvers as  Ms. Marvel . After the events of the  Secret Invasion  story arc,  Norman Osborn  assumed control of the formerly S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored Avengers, now under the auspices of his own agency, H.A.M.M.E.R. All but Ares and the Sentry left this team \u2014 the Wasp appeared to have died \u2014 and the team migrated to the series  Dark Avengers . Osborn recruited  Marvel Boy  to pose as Captain Marvel and  Daken  to pose as his father,  Wolverine , bringing Moonstone, Bullseye, and Venom from his previous  Thunderbolts  team to impersonate Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man, respectively.\nThe heroes include the  Avengers  ( Captain America ,  Captain Marvel  II,  Hawkeye ,  Iron Man  II,  She-Hulk ,  Thor , the  Wasp ); three members of the  Fantastic Four  ( Human Torch ,  Mister Fantastic  and  Thing ); solo heroes  Spider-Man ,  Spider-Woman  II and the  Hulk ; and the mutant team  X-Men  ( Colossus ,  Cyclops ,  Nightcrawler ,  Professor X ,  Rogue ,  Storm ,  Wolverine , and  Lockheed the Dragon ).  Magneto  is featured as a hero, but immediately becomes non-aligned when the Avengers question his presence.\nAfter ingesting a chemical given to him by Norman Osborn, Venom transforms into a more human appearance similar to the Black-Suited Spider-Man. Osborn introduces him as The Amazing Spider-Man, a member of the  Dark Avengers , while unveiling the team. After the Siege of Asgard, Gargan and most of the Dark Avengers were taken into custody. While being held on the  Raft , the Venom Symbiote was forcefully removed from him, ending his career as Venom.\nAugustus Roman is CEO of Empire Unlimited felt abhorrence towards super-humans ever since his family died during a conflict between the Avengers and the Masters of Evil, where made a cameo appearance in Avengers Vol. 1 #277, until he recently made full appearance in Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #1.\n\"Avengers Disassembled\", is a  crossover  event involving  the Avengers ,  Fantastic Four ,  Captain America ,  Spider-Man  and  Thor . \"Avengers Disassembled\" saw the beginning of  Brian Michael Bendis 's Avengers run, with the destruction of the existing \"traditional\" roster and exile of several  key members of the team. The other crossover stories intersect (or in the case of the Spectacular Spider-Man and Thor crossover issues) or take place prior or after to the main Avengers storyline. In particular, the tie-ins saw other changes to the status quo: Iron Man once again closeting his secret identity, Spider-Man developing organic webshooters (like the Sony Spider-Man movies), and the death of Thor and Asgard in one final Ragnarok.\nSpider-Man is a playable character in the mobile game  Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 .\nJessica later appeared as an ally to the Mighty Avengers team formed by Luke Cage. Jessica and Danielle lived in the apartment of the Gem Theater, which was serving as the Mighty Avenger's base of operations. She and Luke would later be confronted by the Superior Spider-Man and his Spider Robots, who offered her a place on a different type of Avengers team that was to be run by him. Jessica swiftly found a baby sitter for her child and refused before delivering a powerful punch to Spider-Man's face for his threat. The group was later backed up by She-Hulk and she and Jessica decided to go out for coffee. Jessica and Luke would later switch apartments with an old friend of Luke's named David Griffiths. While moving in, Jessica spoke to the  Blue Marvel  about what it's like to raise a child of superheroes and expressed both her support and annoyance at her husband's choice to start another team of Avengers.\nWhile Jarvis was shown dating  May Parker  during Spider-Man's initial career in the  New Avengers , this relationship has been negated by the revelation that the man that May had dated was a  Skrull  impostor.\nwhile there s an argument to be made for marvel controlling the spider man movie franchise given its apparent troubles at sony introducing the character into captain america civil war wouldn t have served spider man or the greater marvel cinematic universe as well as either deservesn the original civil war storyline spider man is caught in the ideological struggle between iron man and captain america over whether or not superheroes should register their identities with the authorities to continue to operate with heroes who register being forced to work for the government in response\nGenre: rpg.

Sure, in the recent comics Spider-Man may be on the team, but he was a dedicated solo act for at least 40 years of his 50-year run. Not having Spider-Man in an Avengers film is no different to me than Spider-Man not being in an Avengers comic. I think fans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desires aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily Avengers-specific, though.\nSpiderman is another all-time American classic comic that was adapted into many movies.
