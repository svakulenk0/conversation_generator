{"input_text": "Groups of the Sea Peoples mentioned in Egyptian documents are the Ekwesh, a group of Bronze Age  Greeks  (Achaeans; Ahhiyawa in Hittite texts);  Teresh ,  Tyrrhenians  (Tyrsenoi), known to later Greeks as sailors and pirates from Anatolia, ancestors of the Etruscans;  Luka , an  Anatolians  coastal people of western Anatolia, also known from Hittite sources (their name survives in classical  Lycia  on the southwest coast of Anatolia);  Sherden , probably  Sardinians  (the Sherden acted as mercenaries of the Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh, 1299 BCE);  Shekelesh , probably identical with the  Italic  tribe called  Siculi ; and  Peleset , generally believed to refer to the  Philistines , who perhaps came from Crete and were the only major tribe of the Sea Peoples to settle permanently in  Palestine .\nIn the 13th century BCE, at the end of the  Bronze Age , seafaring invaders from  Europe  and the  Aegean  known as the  Sea Peoples  entered the  Eastern Mediterranean , invading  Anatolia ,  Syria ,  Canaan ,  Cyprus  and  Egypt . The invasions by the Sea Peoples ushered the  Bronze Age Collapse , which resulted in the cultural collapse of  Mycenean Greece , the  Hittite Empire , the  New Kingdom of Egypt  and the civilizations of Canaan and Syria. The Sea Peoples are regarded as being composed of various groups of  Indo-European  peoples.\nIn 1178 BCE, the  Battle of Djahy (Canaan)  between  Ramesses III  and the  Sea Peoples  marked the beginning of the decline in power of the  New Kingdom  in the  Levant  during the wider  Bronze Age collapse .\nThere was also a poorly documented troop called the nrrn (Ne'arin or Nearin), possibly  Canaan ite military mercenaries with Egyptian allegiance or even Egyptians, which Ramesses II had left in  Amurru , apparently in order to secure the port of  Sumur . This division would come to play a critical role in the battle. Also significant was the presence of  Sherden  troops within the  Egyptian army . This is the first time they appear as Egyptian mercenaries, and they would play an increasingly significant role in  Late Bronze Age  history, ultimately appearing among the  Sea Peoples  that ravaged the east Mediterranean at the end of the  Bronze Age . Healy in Armies of the Pharaohs observes:\nThe Ancient  Levant  had been initially dominated by a number of indigenous  Semitic speaking peoples ; the  Canaan ites, the  Amorites  and  Assyria ns, in addition to Indo-European powers; the  Luwians ,  Mitanni  and the  Hittites . However, during the collapse of the Late Bronze Age, the coastal regions came under attack from a collection of nine seafaring tribes known as the  Sea Peoples . The transitional period is believed by historians to have been a violent, sudden and culturally disruptive time. During this period, the Eastern Mediterranean saw the fall of the  Mycenaean Kingdoms , the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the  New Kingdom of Egypt  in Syria and Canaan.\nThe inscriptions at Medinet Habu consist of images depicting a coalition of Sea Peoples, among them the Peleset, who are said in the accompanying text to have been defeated by Ramesses III during his Year 8 campaign. In about 1175 BC, Egypt was threatened with a massive land and sea invasion by the \"Sea Peoples,\" a coalition of foreign enemies which included the  Tjeker , the Shekelesh, the Deyen, the Weshesh, the Teresh, the  Sherden , and the PRST. They were comprehensively defeated by Ramesses III, who fought them in \" Djahy \" (the eastern Mediterranean coast) and at \"the mouths of the rivers\" (the  Nile Delta ), recording his victories in a series of inscriptions in his mortuary temple at  Medinet Habu . Scholars have been unable to conclusively determine which images match what peoples described in the  reliefs  depicting two major battle scenes. A separate relief on one of the bases of the Osirid  pillar s with an accompanying hieroglyphic text clearly identifying the person depicted as a captive Peleset chief is of a bearded man without headdress. This has led to the interpretation that Ramesses III defeated the  Sea Peoples  including Philistines and settled their captives in fortresses in southern Canaan; another related theory suggests that Philistines invaded and settled the coastal plain for themselves. The soldiers were quite tall and clean shaven. They wore  breastplate s and short  kilt s, and their superior weapons included  chariot s drawn by two horses. They carried small shields and fought with straight swords and spears.\nThe Sea Peoples  are a purported seafaring  confederation  of groups known to have attacked  ancient Egypt  prior to the  Late Bronze Age collapse . Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of  Wilhelm Max M\u00fcller : \"the most important questions of  ethnography  and the primitive history of classic nations\".\nThe  Linear B  Tablets of  Pylos  in the  Late Bronze Age  in the  Aegean  demonstrate increased slave raiding and the spread of mercenaries and migratory peoples and their subsequent resettlement. Despite this, the actual identity of the Sea Peoples has remained enigmatic and modern scholars have only the scattered records of ancient civilizations and archaeological analysis to inform them. Evidence shows that the identities and motives of these peoples were known to the Egyptians. In fact, many had sought employment with the Egyptians or were in a diplomatic relationship for a few centuries before the Late  Bronze Age Collapse . For example, select groups, or members of groups, of the Sea People, such as the Sherden or  Shardana , were used as mercenaries by Egyptian Pharaohs such as  Ramesses II .\nThere is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural patterns which some scholars think may indicate an invasion (or at least a migration) into Southern Great Britain around the 12th century BC. This disruption was felt far beyond Britain, even beyond Europe, as most of the great  Near East ern empires collapsed (or experienced severe difficulties) and the  Sea Peoples  harried the entire  Mediterranean  basin around this time.  Cremation  was adopted as a burial practice, with  cemeteries  of  urns  containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record. According to  John T. Koch  and others, the Celtic languages developed during this Late Bronze Age period in an intensely trading-networked culture called the  Atlantic Bronze Age  that included  Britain, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal, but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the  Hallstatt culture .\nThe focus of his academic interest was in what he termed the Pax Hethitica, a period of the 13th century BC - a golden age of international diplomatic relations between the great powers and with their  Levant ine vassals. He was the first researcher to theorize that it was the internal rivalries and the schism which rendered the Hittite empire vulnerable to the  Bronze Age collapse  and the coup de grace delivered by the  Sea Peoples  and others. His publications numbered over a hundred papers in academic journals, to which he continued to contribute well into retirement. For several years he was a member of the editorial board of the scholarly journal  Antiguo Oriente .\nThe hypothesis of a  Dorian invasion , known as such in  Ancient Greek tradition , that led to the end of Mycenaean Greece, is supported by sporadic archaeological evidence such as new types of burials, in particular cist graves, and the use of a new dialect of Greek, the  Doric  one. It appears that the Dorians moved southward gradually over a number of years and devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centers. A new type of ceramic also appeared, called \"Barbarian Ware\" because it was attributed to invaders from the north. On the other hand, the collapse of Mycenaean Greece coincides with the activity of the  Sea Peoples  in the Eastern Mediterranean. They caused widespread destruction in Anatolia and the Levant and were finally  defeated  by Pharaoh  Ramesses III  in c. 1175 BC. One of the ethnic groups that comprised these people were the Eqwesh, a name that appears to be linked with the Ahhiyawa of the Hittite inscriptions.\nThe city became one of the most important centres in the Hittite Empire, during the Late Bronze Age, and reached its apogee around the 11th century BC.  While the Hittite empire fell to the  Sea Peoples  during the  Bronze Age collapse , Carchemish survived the Sea People's attacks to continue to be  the capital of an important  Neo-Hittite  kingdom in the  Iron Age , and a trading center. Although Ramesses III states in an inscription dating to his 8th Year from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple that Carchemish was destroyed by the Sea Peoples, the city evidently survived the onslaught. King Kuzi-Tesup I is attested in power here and was the son of  Talmi-Teshub  who was a contemporary of the last Hittite king,  Suppiluliuma II . He and his successors ruled a \"mini-empire\" stretching from Southeast Asia Minor to Northern Syria and the West bend of the Euphrates under the title \"Great King\". This suggests that Kuzi-Tesub saw himself as the true heir of the line of the great Suppiliuma I and that the central dynasty at Hattusa was now defunct. This powerful polity lasted from c.1175 to 975 BC when it began losing control of its farther possessions and became gradually a more local city state centered around Carchemish.\nThe development of iron smelting was once attributed to the  Hittites  of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. It was believed that they maintained a monopoly on ironworking, and that their empire had been based on that advantage. Accordingly, the invading  Sea Peoples  were responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. This theory is no longer held in the common current thought of the majority of scholarship, since there is no archaeological evidence of the alleged Hittite monopoly. While there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period; and only a small number of these objects are weapons. As part of the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age, the  Bronze Age collapse  saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region. The  Ugaritic script  was in use during this time, around 1300 BC.  Ugarit  was one of the centres of the literate world.\nIn Egypt, Ramesses III was fighting to save his country and Empire in the midst of the Bronze Age collapse, a prolonged period of region-wide droughts, crop failures, depopulation, and collapse of urban centers.  It is likely that the Nile irrigated lands remained fruitful and would have been highly desirable to Egypt\u2019s neighbors. During this chaotic time, a new warlike group of people from the north, the Sea People, repeatedly attacked and plundered various Near Eastern powers.\nAfter defeating the Sea Peoples on land in Syria, Ramesses rushed back to Egypt where preparations for the invaders' assault had already been completed. According to the Medinet Habu inscriptions, Ramesses looked towards the sea and stared at a force of thousands of enemies and, with them, the threat of the end of the Egyptian empire. Ramesses lined the shores of the  Nile Delta  with ranks of archers who were ready to release volleys of arrows into the enemy ships if they attempted to land. Knowing that he would be defeated in the battle at sea, Ramesses enticed the  Sea Peoples  and their ships into the mouth of the  Nile , where he had assembled a fleet in ambush. This Egyptian fleet worked the Sea Peoples' boats towards shore.  Then archers both on land and on the ships devastated the enemy.  The Sea People's ships were overturned, many were killed and captured and some even dragged to the shore where they were killed.  In the inscriptions, Ramesses proclaims:\nMycenaean Greece perished with the  collapse of Bronze Age culture  in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called  Greek Dark Ages , a recordless transitional period leading to  Archaic Greece  where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio-economic organization (including the extensive use of iron). Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the  Dorian invasion  or activities connected to the \u201c Sea Peoples \u201d. Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have been also suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient  Greek literature  and  mythology , including the  Trojan Epic Cycle .\nThe Sea People invasions are often listed among the causes or symptoms of the  Bronze Age collapse .  Ramesses had fought the Sea Peoples in southern  Lebanon , at the  Battle of Djahy . Ramesses III describes a great movement of peoples in the East from the Mediterranean, which caused a massive destruction of the former great powers of the Levant, Cyprus and Anatolia:\nHe followed (1964\u20131967) with excavations at  Tell es-Sa'idiyeh , on the east bank in the  Jordan Valley ,  Jordan , which revealed itself as a meeting place for disparate cultures during the transition in the late  Bronze Age  to the use of iron, which he connected to the influence of the  Sea Peoples  (\"New evidence on the role of the Sea Peoples in Canaan at the Beginning of the Iron Age\"), in The Role of the Phoenicians, 1968. His work was cut short by the 1967  Six-Day War .\nRamesses III had previously defeated an attack by the  Libyans  on the Egyptian Empire's western frontier, in his fifth year.  A greater threat was posed by a group of migrating peoples called the Sea Peoples.  These were times of crisis in the Mediterranean, as many 12th century BC  civilizations were destroyed by the Sea Peoples and other migrating nations . The great  Hittite Empire  fell, as did the  Mycenaean civilization , the kingdom of Cyprus and Ugarit, and other great cultures.\nPrior to and during the Bronze Age Collapse, Syria became a battle ground between the empires of the  Hittites ,  Assyrians ,  Mitanni  and  Egyptians , and the coastal regions came under attack from the  Sea Peoples . From the 13th century BC, the  Arameans  came to prominence in Syria, and the region outside of the  Phoenicia n coastal areas eventually spoke  Aramaic .\nThe growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include interruption of maritime trade by piracy by the  Sea Peoples , as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the Dorian migration or invasion.\nIn the thirteenth century BC, invasions from the west by the Hittites and the south by the  Assyria ns brought the end of the Mitanni empire, which was divided between the two conquering powers. In the following century, attacks by the  Sea Peoples  brought a swift end to the last vestiges of the Hurrian language. It is around this time that other languages, such as the  Hittite language  and the  Ugaritic language  also became extinct, in what is known as the  Bronze Age collapse . In the texts of these languages, as well as those of  Akkadian  or Urartian, many Hurrian names and places can be found.\nThe earliest major habitation in Ashdod dates to the 17th century BCE, when the acropolis of the tell was fortified.  Ashdod is first mentioned in written documents from Late Bronze Age  Ugarit , which indicate that the city was a center of export for dyed woolen purple fabric and garments. At the end of the 13th century BCE the  Sea Peoples  conquered and destroyed Ashdod. By the beginning of the 12th century BCE, the Philistines, generally thought to have been one of the Sea Peoples, ruled the city. During their reign, the city prospered and was a member of the Philistine  Pentapolis  (i.e. five cities; the others were   Ashkelon ,  Ekron ,  Gath , and  Gaza ), which included  Ashkelon  and  Gaza  on the coast and  Ekron  and  Gath  farther inland, in addition to Ashdod.\nThe late Bronze Age (14th-13th-12th centuries BC) saw a vast migration of the so-called  Sea Peoples , described in ancient Egyptian sources. They destroyed Mycenaean and  Hittite  sites and also attacked  Egypt . According to Giovanni Ugas the  Sherden , one of the most important tribes of the sea peoples, are to be identified with the Nuragic  Sardinians . Another hypothesis is that they arrived to the island around the 13th or 12th century after the failed invasion of Egypt. However, these theories remain controversial. Simonides of Ceos  and  Plutarch  spoke of raids by  Sardinians  against the island of  Crete , in the same period in which the Sea People invaded Egypt. This would at least confirm that Nuragic  Sardinians  frequented the eastern Mediterranean Sea.Further proofs come from 13th-century Nuragic ceramics found at  Tiryns ,  Kommos ,  Kokkinokremnos    and in  Sicily , at  Lipari   and the  Agrigento  area, along the sea route linking western to eastern Mediterranean.\nA 12th-century inscription describes Ramesses III\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defeat of the Sea Peoples. The Sea Peoples, a range of groups including the Philistines, led raids on the Eastern Mediterranean during the period of the Bronze Age collapse and are often cited as the reason for the collapse.", "key": "34_5", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.031648", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
