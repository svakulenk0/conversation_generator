In the capacity of the Institute's president, Lilienfeld, then a senator in the Russian parliament, traveled from Saint Petersburg and delivered the opening address on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 21. Remarks and the reading of two papers followed. The next day, Thursday, July 22, a paper by Lester F. Ward (not able to attend the conference) on \"Pain and Pleasure Economy\" was read in the morning, along with another paper by Italian sociologist  Achille Loria. It was only after the break for lunch that the debate over the organic theory began. Jacques Novicow started by reading a paper in support of the theory. He was followed by Lilienfeld. Next,  Gabriel Tarde  heavily critiqued Lilienfeld and Novicow, \"and presented in opposition to the organic theory a psychological theory of social life\" ( Worms 1898 : 110). The session adjourned for the evening, and discussion resumed the next afternoon, Friday, July 23.  Casimir de Kelles-Krauz  opened the offensive against the organic theory with a salvo of  economic materialism. Ludwig Stein then backed up Tarde and Kelles-Krauz with \"the principles of the historical and psychogenetic method of research\" ( Worms 1898 : 111). The founder and general secretary of the Institute, Ren\u00e9 Worms, next \"tried to show something of the exactness and utility of the analogy between organisms and society\" ( Worms 1898 : 111). Worms's attempt, however, was rebuffed by S. R. Steinmetz. Furthermore, though Raphael Garofalo, Charles Limousin, and C. N. Starcke accepted the organic theory, they did so with reservations. The most withering attack on the organic theory seemed to come from Nikolai Kar\u00e9iev, who \"showed that this theory shared, together with Darwin's social theory, economic materialism and social psychic theories, the fate of all exclusive theories\" ( Worms 1898 : 111). Alfred Espinas then tried to salvage the theory by maintaining that societies must \"constitute organisms,\" or else one would have \"to abandon altogether the idea of social life and social laws\" (Worms 1898: 111).

The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that \"without speculation there is no good and original observation\" while commenting that \"I believe I go much further than you\". Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, \" On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type \", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to  Charles Lyell  if he thought it worthwhile.  Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\" Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and  Joseph Hooker, who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace had not asked for publication of his essay, and indeed, doing so probably contravened the copyright law of the time. Wallace's essay was presented to the  Linnean Society of London  on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to  Asa Gray  in 1857.", "qas": [{"id": "question_172", "question": "What was Wallace's relationship to Darwin?", "answers": [{"text": "Wallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories.", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_173", "question": "What did Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker do with Wallace's essay?", "answers": [{"text": "Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received.", "answer_start": 131}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_174", "question": "What did Charles Lyell do after Darwin's death?", "answers": [{"text": "In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species\" of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time.", "answer_start": 236}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_175", "question": "What else was Wallace doing in this time period?", "answers": [{"text": "The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that \"without speculation there is no good and original observation\" while commenting that \"I believe I go much further than you\".", "answer_start": 637}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_176", "question": "What did Charles Lyell and Darwin do when Charles Lyell and Darwin were traveling through the Malay archipelago?", "answers": [{"text": "Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, \" On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type \", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to  ", "answer_start": 887}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_177", "question": "Who was Charles Lyell?", "answers": [{"text": "Charles Lyell  ", "answer_start": 1116}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_178", "question": "Why did Charles Lyell send Wallace's essay to Charles Lyell?", "answers": [{"text": "if he thought it worthwhile.

Rockefeller Foundation  fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with  Vanderbilt University  in  Nashville, Tennessee, where from 1940 to 1947 he taught  physics, yet had his laboratory in the biology department.  In 1941, Delbr\u00fcck met  Salvador Luria  of  Indiana University  who began visiting Vanderbilt.  In 1942,  Delbr\u00fcck and Luria published  on  bacteria l resistance to  virus  infection mediated by random  mutation.   Alfred Hershey  of  Washington University  began visiting in 1943. The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel\u2019s experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin\u2019s theory was provided when Thomas Morgan Hunt discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin\u2019s ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case).

Species  in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.  Thomas Huxley  would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of  natural selection  as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Henry Fairfield Osborn  preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and  orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.", "qas": [{"id": "question_1185", "question": "What was On the Origin of Species?", "answers": [{"text": "Charles Darwin's publication of the  ", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1186", "question": "What else happened in the 19th century", "answers": [{"text": "On the Origin of Species  in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology.", "answer_start": 37}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1187", "question": "what else is known about Charles Darwin?", "answers": [{"text": "Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory.", "answer_start": 144}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1188", "question": "What did Charles Darwin enjoy collecting?", "answers": [{"text": "In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  ", "answer_start": 209}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1189", "question": "What was the origin of species", "answers": [{"text": "South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  ", "answer_start": 277}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1190", "question": "What were some examples of creatures that the  scientific debate had a tendency to find?", "answers": [{"text": "giant llama s", "answer_start": 403}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1191", "question": "What was the evidence of?", "answers": [{"text": "that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times.", "answer_start": 417}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1192", "question": "What did Charles Darwin do next", "answers": [{"text": "The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record.", "answer_start": 501}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1193", "question": "What is the transition between reptiles and birds?", "answers": [{"text": "There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse.", "answer_start": 695}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1194", "question": "What was the first known fossil of Archaeopteryx?", "answers": [{"text": "In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen.", "answer_start": 871}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1195", "question": "What else was there to do in the early years?", "answers": [{"text": "Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881.", "answer_start": 1085}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1196", "question": "What other discoveries?", "answers": [{"text": "Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872.", "answer_start": 1176}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1197", "question": "What else did Charles Darwin discover?", "answers": [{"text": "Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  ", "answer_start": 1255}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1198", "question": "What did Edward Drinker Cope  and Henry Fairfield Osborn  find?", "answers": [{"text": "Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.

increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and  reproduce. Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of  transmutation of species  or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published  On the Origin of Species  in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories, but subsequently referred to specific concepts of natural selection, of the  Weismann barrier  or in  genetics  of the  central dogma of molecular biology.

In 1874,  Charles Hodge, the theologian and intellectual leader at the Presbyterian Seminary in Princeton,  published What is Darwinism?, claiming that  Darwinism, was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Hodge's views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. Hodge simply refused to accept that natural laws alone could create complex organisms that fit into their niches so perfectly and that evolution could explain origins. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile at the college across town (a totally separate institution) President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However in 1868, McCosh became president at the college. McCosh realized that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus demonstrated that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. McCosh thus argued that evolution, far from being inconsistent with belief in  divine design, glorifies the divine designer (see for example his Christianity and Positivism). This aspect of his work found popularity among most Presbyterians clergy, who found his arguments useful in their attempts to cope with scientific philosophy.  The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton.
