{"input_text": "Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection laid the groundwork for modern evolutionary theory, and his experiments and observations showed that the organisms in populations varied from each other, that some of these variations were inherited, and that these differences could be acted on by natural selection. However, he could not explain the source of these variations. Like many of his predecessors, Darwin mistakenly thought that heritable traits were a product of use and disuse, and that features acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. He looked for examples, such as large ground feeding  bird s getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the  ostrich , they could not fly at all. This misunderstanding was called the  inheritance of acquired characters  and was part of the theory of  transmutation of species  put forward in 1809 by  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck . In the late 19th century this theory became known as  Lamarckism . Darwin produced an unsuccessful theory he called  pangenesis  to try to explain how acquired characteristics could be inherited. In the 1880s  August Weismann 's experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse could not be inherited, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favor.\nWhile the term has been applied to the claim that Darwin's theory of  evolution  by natural selection can be used to understand the social endurance of a nation or country, social Darwinism commonly refers to ideas that predate Darwin's publication of  On the Origin of Species . Others whose ideas are given the label include the 18th century clergyman  Thomas Malthus , and Darwin's cousin  Francis Galton  who founded eugenics towards the end of the 19th century.\nRafinesque proposed a theory of evolution before  Charles Darwin . In a letter in 1832, Rafinesque wrote:\nIn July 1897, the Third Congress of the International Institute of Sociology at the  Sorbonne  in Paris erupted with debate over the organic theory of societies. In the capacity of the Institute's president, Lilienfeld, then a senator in the Russian parliament, traveled from Saint Petersburg and delivered the opening address on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 21. Remarks and the reading of two papers followed. The next day, Thursday, July 22, a paper by Lester F. Ward (not able to attend the conference) on \"Pain and Pleasure Economy\" was read in the morning, along with another paper by Italian sociologist  Achille Loria . It was only after the break for lunch that the debate over the organic theory began. Jacques Novicow started by reading a paper in support of the theory. He was followed by Lilienfeld. Next,  Gabriel Tarde  heavily critiqued Lilienfeld and Novicow, \"and presented in opposition to the organic theory a psychological theory of social life\" ( Worms 1898 : 110). The session adjourned for the evening, and discussion resumed the next afternoon, Friday, July 23.  Casimir de Kelles-Krauz  opened the offensive against the organic theory with a salvo of  economic materialism . Ludwig Stein then backed up Tarde and Kelles-Krauz with \"the principles of the historical and psychogenetic method of research\" ( Worms 1898 : 111). The founder and general secretary of the Institute, Ren\u00e9 Worms, next \"tried to show something of the exactness and utility of the analogy between organisms and society\" ( Worms 1898 : 111). Worms's attempt, however, was rebuffed by S. R. Steinmetz. Furthermore, though Raphael Garofalo, Charles Limousin, and C. N. Starcke accepted the organic theory, they did so with reservations. The most withering attack on the organic theory seemed to come from Nikolai Kar\u00e9iev, who \"showed that this theory shared, together with Darwin's social theory, economic materialism and social psychic theories, the fate of all exclusive theories\" ( Worms 1898 : 111). Alfred Espinas then tried to salvage the theory by maintaining that societies must \"constitute organisms,\" or else one would have \"to abandon altogether the idea of social life and social laws\" (Worms 1898: 111). Novicow closed the section by reaffirming his faith in the organic theory, and Worms in his report stated that, by and large, the congress had \"been productive of the most happy results\" ( Worms 1898 : 109).\nDarwin's most important scientific work,  Zoonomia  (1794\u20131796), contains a system of  pathology  and a chapter on ' Generation '. In the latter, he anticipated some of the views of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck , which foreshadowed the modern theory of  evolution . Erasmus Darwin's works were read and commented on by his grandson  Charles Darwin  the naturalist. Erasmus Darwin based his theories on  David Hartley 's psychological theory of  associationism . The essence of his views is contained in the following passage, which he follows up with the conclusion that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause of all organic life:\nThe most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck ; based on the  inheritance of acquired characteristics  (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist  Charles Darwin , combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell,  Thomas Malthus 's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on  natural selection ; similar evidence led  Alfred Russel Wallace  to independently reach the same conclusions.  Charles Darwin 's early interest in nature led him on a  five-year voyage  on  which established him as an eminent  geologist  whose observations and theories supported  Charles Lyell 's  uniformitarian  ideas, and publication of his  journal of the voyage  made him famous as a popular author. Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and  fossil s he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the  transmutation of species  and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when  Alfred Russel Wallace  sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of  both of their theories .Darwin's  On the Origin of Species , published on 24 November 1859, a seminal work of scientific literature, was to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.\nWallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received. In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species\" of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time. The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that \"without speculation there is no good and original observation\" while commenting that \"I believe I go much further than you\". Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, \" On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type \", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to  Charles Lyell  if he thought it worthwhile.  Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters ... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\" Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and  Joseph Hooker , who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace had not asked for publication of his essay, and indeed, doing so probably contravened the copyright law of the time. Wallace's essay was presented to the  Linnean Society of London  on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to  Asa Gray  in 1857.\nThe decades before the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been described as  the eclipse of Darwinism . Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the mechanism of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were  neo-Lamarckism  (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution),  orthogenesis  (\"straight-line\" evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of  Mendelism  and  Hugo De Vries '  mutation theory . Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term  Darwinism  had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of  August Weismann  who went further than Darwin by rejecting  inheritance of acquired characters  and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called  neo-Darwinism . By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the  modern evolutionary synthesis , which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism.\nSocial Darwinism is a  social theory  which holds that  Darwin 's theory of  evolution  by  natural selection  is a model, not only for the development of biological traits in a population, but also as an application for human  social institution s \u2014 the existing social institutions being implicitly declared as  normative . Social Darwinism shares its roots with early  progressivism , and was most popular from the late nineteenth century to the end of  World War II . Proponents of Social Darwinism argue that the theory justifies  social inequality  as being meritocratic. Darwin only ventured to propound his theories in a biological sense, and it is other thinkers and theorists who have applied Darwin's model to unequal endowments of human ambitions.In his book Meritocratic Education and Social Worthlessness (Palgrave, 2012), the philosopher  Khen Lampert , argued that educational-meritocracy is nothing but a  post-modern  version of Social-Darwinism.\nSpencer's attempt to explain the  evolution of complexity  was radically different from that to be found in Darwin's  Origin of Species  which was published two years later. Spencer is often, quite erroneously, believed to have merely appropriated and generalised Darwin's work on  natural selection . But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase ' survival of the fittest ' as his own term for Darwin's concept, and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognised was  Lamarckian  use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations. Spencer believed that this evolutionary mechanism was also necessary to explain 'higher' evolution, especially the social development of humanity. Moreover, in contrast to Darwin, he held that evolution had a direction and an end-point, the attainment of a final state of equilibrium. He tried to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology. He proposed that society was the product of change from lower to higher forms, just as in the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life are said to be evolving into higher forms. Spencer claimed that man's mind had evolved in the same way from the simple automatic responses of lower animals to the process of reasoning in the thinking man. Spencer believed in two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained by the individual and knowledge gained by the race. Intuition, or knowledge learned unconsciously, was the inherited experience of the race.\nIn 1842 in his first  monograph ,  The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs ,  Charles Darwin  set out his theory of the formation of  atoll reef s, an idea he conceived during the  voyage of the Beagle . He theorized  uplift  and  subsidence  of the Earth's  crust  under the oceans formed the atolls. Darwin\u2019s theory sets out a sequence of three stages in atoll formation. It starts with a  fringing reef  forming around an extinct  volcanic island  as the island and ocean floor subsides. As the subsidence continues, the fringing reef becomes a barrier reef, and ultimately an atoll reef.\nDarwin's theory succeeded in profoundly altering scientific opinion regarding the development of life and in producing a small philosophical revolution. However, this theory could not explain several critical components of the evolutionary process. Specifically, Darwin was unable to explain the source of variation in traits within a species, and could not identify a mechanism that could pass traits faithfully from one generation to the next. Darwin's  hypothesis  of  pangenesis , while relying in part on the inheritance of acquired characteristics, proved to be useful for statistical models of evolution that were developed by his cousin  Francis Galton  and the \"biometric\" school of evolutionary thought. However, this idea proved to be of little use to other biologists.\nIn 1858  Charles Darwin  and  Alfred Russel Wallace  published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's  On the Origin of Species  (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed  common descent  and a branching  tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of  natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from  animal husbandry ,  biogeography ,  geology ,  morphology , and  embryology .\nVeblen was deeply influenced by the Darwinian belief in the principle of causality. Unlike the German School, Darwin\u2019s theories were systematically connected and explained series of seemingly disconnected phenomena throughout life. He developed a theoretical system of his own, inspired by Darwin\u2019s theories, which recognized natural and observable forces, rather than divine and  teleological  ones. With this, Veblen also critiqued the neoclassical beliefs of economics, which stated that economics were passive and essentially inert. Upon this critique, Veblen built his theories of economics.\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern  biology . The concept, published by Darwin and  Alfred Russel Wallace  in a  joint presentation of papers in 1858 , was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life , which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional  Darwinian evolution  with subsequent discoveries in  classical genetics  formed the  modern evolutionary synthesis  of the mid-20th century. The addition of  molecular genetics  has led to  evolutionary developmental biology , which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random  genetic drift , natural selection remains the primary explanation for  adaptive evolution .\nPhillip E. Johnson (born June 18, 1940) is a retired  UC Berkeley   law  professor and author who is considered the father of the  intelligent design movement . He became a  Christian  while a tenured professor. He is a critic of what he calls \"Darwinism\".  By \"Darwinism\", he means \"fully naturalistic evolution, involving chance mechanisms and natural selection\".  As a Christian, Johnson believes \"that a God exists who could create out of nothing if He wanted to do so, but who also might have chosen to work through a natural evolutionary process instead\".  Johnson rejects that  evolution  is a fact and favors  neo-creationary  views known as  intelligent design  (ID). He was a co-founder of the  Discovery Institute 's  Center for Science and Culture  (CSC) and is credited with establishing the  wedge strategy , which aims to change public opinion and  scientific consensus , and seeks to convince the  scientific community  to allow a role for  God  in scientific theory.  As a member of The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis, a prominent  AIDS denialist  group, Johnson has argued that  HIV  does not cause  AIDS . The clear consensus of the scientific community considers Johnson's opinions on evolution and AIDS to be  pseudoscience .  In Chapter 12 of \"Darwin on Trial\" entitled \"Science and Pseudoscience\", Johnson argues that scientists accepted the theory of evolution \"before it was rigorously tested, and thereafter used all their authority to convince the public that naturalistic processes are sufficient to produce a human from a bacterium, and a bacterium from a mix of chemicals.\"\nIn his book Evolution and Judaism, Krauskopf accepted the idea that science might \u201covershadow\u201d religion but that the science needs to be well understood and properly connected to religion.  Krauskopf accepted the scientific legitimacy of evolution and Darwinian theory. He argued, in a chapter titled \u201cDarwinism,\u201d that \u201cSupreme order is the manifestation of supreme intelligence.  If I had no other proof for my belief in the existence and sovereignty of an Intelligent Final Cause, I would derive it from my recognition of the fact that supreme order, uninterrupted harmony, eternal and immutable law, control all nature, heaven and earth, all inorganic and organic, in but one way, and in no other.\u201d  He argues that evolution is simply part of the law of nature and that \u201cthis natural law shape matter with design and direct force with a purpose, and design and purpose presuppose intelligence.\u201d  Krauskopf argued that evolution was the same as \u201cSupreme Governing Power, Supreme Will, Supreme Natural Law\u201d and that \u201cby theologians it is called \u2018God.\u2019\u201d  With \u201cthis conception of the nature of God\u201d he argued that \u201cevery difference between science and religion disappears\u201d and \u201cwith this conception of God, as manifested in nature, I am prepared to accept even Darwinism.\u201d  Thus, Krauskopf accepted evolution, as set out by Darwin, as consistent with the existence of God, because God provided the \u201csupreme intelligence\u201d to let evolution happen.  Under this analysis, there could be no conflict between religion and science, and \u201cDarwinism, though disagreeing with the Biblical account of creation is with religion, not against it.\u201d  He praised Darwin, declaring that \u201cGod has had no better interpreter of the greatness and magnificence of His handiwork.\u201d  He acknowledged that Darwin \u201copposed\u201d the \u201cBiblical account\u201d of creation,  because modern research proved the Biblical account of creation imperfect,\u201d   But Krauskopf argued that this science, and Darwinian notions such as natural selection, actually supported the idea of a superior being \u2013 God \u2013 who set into motion evolution through natural selection.   He concluded that \u201cJudaism and ever progressive religion with a conception of God . . . can freely and conscientiously accept the theory of organic evolution.\u201d   Thus, the \u201csum of Supreme Will, Supreme Power, Supreme Intelligence, evolutionists name \u2018The Reign of Natural Law,\u2019  the theologians call it \u2018God.\u2019\u201d\nHowever, Darwinism is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, sometimes called \"neo-Darwinism,\" from those first proposed by Darwin. Darwinism also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, Darwinism may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and  gene flow . It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the  history of evolutionary thought \u2014particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nDarwin's book revolutionized the way naturalists viewed the world. The book and its promotion attracted attention and controversy, and many theologians reacted to Darwin's theories. For example, in his 1874 work What is Darwinism? the theologian  Charles Hodge  argued that Darwin's theories were tantamount to  atheism . The controversy was fueled in part by one of Darwin's most vigorous promoters, Thomas Henry Huxley, who opined that  Christianity  is a \"...compound of some of the best and some of the worst elements of  Paganism  and  Judaism , moulded in practice by the innate character of certain people of the  Western world ...\" Perhaps the most uncompromising of the evolutionary philosophers was Ernst Haeckel, who dogmatically affirmed that nothing spiritual exists.\nWhen  Charles Darwin  died, Romanes defended Darwin\u2019s theories by attempting to rebut criticisms and attacks levied by other psychologists against the Darwinian school of thought. Perhaps most notably, Romanes expanded on Darwin\u2019s theories of  evolution  and  natural selection  by advancing a theory of behavior based on  comparative psychology . In  Animal Intelligence , Romanes demonstrated similarities and dissimilarities between cognitive and physical functions of various animals. In Mental Evolution in Animals, Romanes illustrated the evolution of the cognitive and physical functions associated with animal life. Romanes believed that animal intelligence evolves through behavioral conditioning, or positive reinforcement. Romanes then published Mental Evolution in Man, which focused on the evolution of human cognitive and physical functions.\nThe publication of  Darwin 's  The Origin of Species  in 1859 introduced  human evolution . However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in \" social Darwinism \" theories.  Herbert Spencer , who coined the term \" survival of the fittest ,\" or  Lewis Henry Morgan  in  Ancient Society  (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These 19th-century  unilineal evolution  theories claimed that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more  civilised  over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.\nIn 1859,  Charles Darwin  placed the whole theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so. This changed the attitudes of most exponents of the scientific method. Darwin's discoveries revolutionised the zoological and botanical sciences, by introducing the  theory  of  evolution  by  natural selection  as an explanation for the diversity of all animal and plant life. The subject-matter of this new science, or branch of biological science, had been neglected: it did not form part of the studies of the collector and systematist, nor was it a branch of anatomy, nor of the physiology pursued by medical men, nor again was it included in the field of microscopy and the cell theory. Almost a thousand years before Darwin, the Arab scholar  Al-Jahiz  (781 \u2013 868) had already developed a rudimentary theory of natural selection , describing the  Struggle for existence  in his Book of Animals where he speculates on how environmental factors can affect the characteristics of species by forcing them to adapt and then passing on those new traits to future generations. However, his work had largely been forgotten, along with many other early advances of Arab scientists, and there is no evidence that his works were known to Darwin.\nIn the 1990s Loye wrote about  Charles Darwin \u2019s case for moral evolution rather than the \"survival of the fittest/ selfish gene theory \" mindset as a higher order prime driver for human evolution. Of his book Darwin\u2019s Lost Theory, internationally eminent scientist  Ervin Laszlo  has written: \"...everyone concerned with our understanding of evolution on this planet owes Loye a deep debt of gratitude...Of urgent importance to the intellectual discourse of our time...has brought his unique erudition to an enormous and critical task, and carried it off with genius...Should cause a revolution in social theory...Dramatically changes our understanding of Darwin and of evolution itself...One of the major books of the early Twenty-First Century\"\nEvolutionary biology is partly based on  paleontology , which uses the  fossil  record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as  population genetics  and evolutionary theory. Following the development of  DNA fingerprinting  techniques in the late 20th century, the application of these techniques in zoology has increased the understanding of animal populations.  In the 1980s,  developmental biology  re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the  modern synthesis  through the study of  evolutionary developmental biology . Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are  phylogenetics ,  systematics , and  taxonomy .\nCharles Darwin and the Tree of Life is a 2009 television documentary about  Charles Darwin  and his revolutionary theory of  evolution  through  natural selection , produced by the  BBC  to mark the bicentenary of Darwin's birth. It is part of the  BBC Darwin Season . The presenter,  David Attenborough , outlines the development of the theory by Darwin through his observations of animals and plants in nature and in the domesticated state, visiting sites important in Darwin's own life, including  Down House ,  Cambridge University  and the  Natural History Museum , and using archive footage from Attenborough's many  nature documentaries  for the BBC.  He reviews the development of the theory since its beginnings, and its revolutionary impact on the way in which humans view themselves - not as having dominion over the animals as  The Bible  says, but as part of the natural world and subject to the same controlling forces that govern all life on  Earth .\nThe term \"classical social evolutionism\" is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer (who coined the phrase \" survival of the fittest \") and  William Graham Sumner . In many ways Spencer's theory of ' cosmic evolution ' has much more in common with the works of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of  Charles Darwin . Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the  individual  (rather than the  collectivity ) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon.\nIn the latter 19th century, the department of  zoology  taught  evolutionary theory , with  Carl Gegenbaur ,  Ernst Haeckel  and others publishing detailed theories at the time of  Darwin 's \" Origin of Species \" (1858).  The later fame of  Ernst Haeckel  eclipsed Darwin in some  Europe an countries, as the term \"Haeckelism\" was more common than  Darwinism .\n\"Darwinism\" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase \" survival of the fittest \" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  than to that of Darwin, and predated the  publication of Darwin's theory  in 1859. What is now called \" Social Darwinism \" was, in its day, synonymous with \"Darwinism\"\u2014the application of Darwinian principles of \"struggle\" to society, usually in support of anti- philanthropic  political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin  Francis Galton , was that \"Darwinism\" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on \"civilized\" people, it was possible for \"inferior\" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the  gene pool ) to overwhelm the \"superior\" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable\u2014the foundation of  eugenics .\nAlthough Delbr\u00fcck's  Rockefeller Foundation  fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with  Vanderbilt University  in  Nashville, Tennessee , where from 1940 to 1947 he taught  physics , yet had his laboratory in the biology department.  In 1941, Delbr\u00fcck met  Salvador Luria  of  Indiana University  who began visiting Vanderbilt.  In 1942,  Delbr\u00fcck and Luria published  on  bacteria l resistance to  virus  infection mediated by random  mutation .   Alfred Hershey  of  Washington University  began visiting in 1943. The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel\u2019s experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin\u2019s theory was provided when Thomas Morgan Hunt discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin\u2019s ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code.\nWhile on Baffin Island he began to develop his interest in studying non-Western cultures (resulting in his book, The Central Eskimo, published in 1888). In 1885, Boas went to work with physical anthropologist  Rudolf Virchow  and  ethnologist   Adolf Bastian  at the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin. Boas had studied anatomy with Virchow two years earlier, while preparing for the Baffin Island expedition. At the time, Virchow was involved in a vociferous debate over evolution with his former student,  Ernst Haeckel . Haeckel had abandoned his medical practice to study comparative anatomy after reading  Charles Darwin 's The Origin of Species, and vigorously promoted Darwin's ideas in Germany. However, like most other natural scientists prior to the rediscovery of  Mendelian genetics  in 1900 and the development of the  modern synthesis , Virchow felt that Darwin's theories were weak because they lacked a theory of cellular mutability. Accordingly, Virchow favored  Lamarckian  models of evolution. This debate resonated with debates among geographers. Lamarckians believed that environmental forces could precipitate rapid and enduring changes in organisms that had no inherited source; thus, Lamarckians and environmental determinists often found themselves on the same side of debates.\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern  biology . The term was introduced by Darwin in his groundbreaking 1859 book  On the Origin of Species , in which natural selection was described by analogy to  artificial selection , a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favored for reproduction. The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of  heredity ; at the time of Darwin's writing, nothing was known of modern genetics. The union of traditional  Darwinian evolution  with subsequent discoveries in  classical  and  molecular genetics  is termed the  modern evolutionary synthesis . Natural selection remains the primary explanation for  adaptive evolution .\nCharles Darwin  was a natural theologist who studied around the world, and most importantly in the  Galapagos Islands . Darwin introduced the idea of natural selection, as he theorized against previously accepted ideas that species were static or unchanging. His contributions to biogeography and the theory of evolution were different from those of other explorers of his time, because he developed a mechanism to describe the ways that species changed. His influential ideas include the development of theories regarding the struggle for existence and natural selection. Darwin\u2019s theories started a biological segment to biogeography and empirical studies, which enabled future scientists to develop ideas about the geographical distribution of organisms around the globe.\nOn the Origin of Species (or more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), published on 24 November 1859, is a work of  scientific literature  by  Charles Darwin  which is considered to be the foundation of  evolutionary biology .  Darwin's book introduced the  scientific theory  that populations  evolve  over the course of generations through a process of  natural selection . It presented a body of evidence that  the diversity of life  arose by  common descent  through a  branching pattern of evolution . Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on  the Beagle expedition  in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.\nWhen  Charles Darwin  presented his mammal and bird specimens collected during the  second voyage of HMS Beagle  to the  Zoological Society of London  on 4 January 1837, the bird specimens were given to Gould for identification. He set aside his paying work and at the next meeting on 10 January reported that birds from the  Gal\u00e1pagos Islands  which Darwin had thought were blackbirds, \"gross-bills\" and  finch es were in fact \"a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar\" as to form \"an entirely new group, containing 12 species.\" This story made the newspapers. In March, Darwin met Gould again, learning that his Gal\u00e1pagos \"wren\" was another species of finch and the  mockingbird s he had labelled by island were separate species rather than just varieties, with relatives on the South American mainland. Subsequently, Gould advised that the smaller southern  Rhea   specimen that had been rescued from a Christmas dinner was a separate species which he named Rhea darwinii, whose territory overlapped with the northern rheas.  Darwin had not bothered to label his finches by island, but others on the expedition had taken more care. He now sought specimens collected by captain  Robert FitzRoy  and crewmen. From them he was able to establish that the species were unique to islands, an important step on the  inception of his theory  of  evolution  by  natural selection . Gould's work on the birds was published between 1838 and 1842 in five numbers as Part 3 of  Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle , edited by Charles Darwin.\nIn Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term \"Darwinism,\" and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and  Ernst Haeckel  developed what was known as Darwinismus in Germany, although, like Spencer's \"evolution,\" Haeckel's \"Darwinism\" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection. In 1886,  Alfred Russel Wallace  went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called \"Darwinism\" without any problems.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s a modern evolutionary synthesis connected natural selection, mutation theory, and Mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis was able to explain patterns observed across species in populations, through  fossil transitions  in palaeontology, and even complex cellular mechanisms in  developmental biology . The publication of the structure of  DNA  by  James Watson  and  Francis Crick  in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.  Molecular biology  improved our understanding of the relationship between  genotype  and  phenotype . Advancements were also made in  phylogenetic   systematics , mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of  evolutionary trees . In 1973, evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky  penned that \" nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" because it has brought to light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent  explanatory  body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet.\nWhile on the Erebus, Hooker had read proofs of  Charles Darwin 's  Voyage of the Beagle  provided by  Charles Lyell  and had been very impressed by Darwin's skill as a naturalist. They had met once, before the Antarctic voyage embarked. After Hooker's return to England, he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the  Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . Hooker agreed and the pair began a lifelong friendship. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the  transmutation of species  and  natural selection , and Hooker showed interest. In 1847 he agreed to read Darwin's \"Essay\" explaining the theory, and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback. Their correspondence continued throughout the  development of Darwin's theory  and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was \"the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy\".\nIn October 1836  Charles Darwin  returned from the  Beagle voyage  with fossil collections which the anatomist  Richard Owen  described, contributing to the  inception of Darwin's theory  of  natural selection . Darwin outlined his theory in an Essay of 1844, and discussed transmutation with his friend  Joseph Dalton Hooker . He did not tell Owen, who as the up-and-coming \"English  Cuvier \" held the conventional belief that every species was uniquely created perfectly adapted. Owen's brilliance and political skills made him a leading figure in the scientific establishment, developing ideas of divine  archetype s produced by vague secondary laws similar to a form of  theistic evolution , while emphasising the differences separating man from ape. At the end of 1844 the anonymous book  Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation  brought wide public interest in  transmutation of species  and the idea that humans were descended from apes, and after a slow initial response, strong condemnation from the scientific establishment.\nThe term Darwinism is often used in the United States by promoters of  creationism , notably by leading members of the  intelligent design movement , as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an \"ism\") of  philosophical naturalism , or  atheism . For example,  UC Berkeley   law  professor and author  Phillip E. Johnson  makes this accusation of atheism with reference to  Charles Hodge 's book What Is Darwinism? (1874). However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American  botanist   Asa Gray  who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: \"It is Atheism.\" Creationists use the term Darwinism, often pejoratively, to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as  dogma tic and inflexible in their  belief . In the 2008  documentary  film  Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed , which promotes  intelligent design  (ID), American writer and actor  Ben Stein  refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for  Scientific American ,  John Rennie  says \"The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to  Marxism .\"\nOne of the first and most important naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the  X Club  to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with  naturalism  and to end the domination of British  natural science  by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of  Archaeopteryx  in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in  North America . Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as  France , and the countries of southern Europe and  Latin America  was slower. An exception to this was  Germany , where both  August Weismann  and  Ernst Haeckel  championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.\nSubsequently, on  the voyage of the Beagle , Darwin found that nature was not so beneficent, and the distribution of  species  did not support ideas of divine creation.  In 1838, shortly after his return, Darwin  conceived his theory  that  natural selection , rather than divine design, was the best explanation for gradual change in populations over many generations. He  published the theory in  On the Origin of Species  in 1859, and in later editions, he noted responses that he had received:\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the  Scientific Revolution  from the 17th century and the United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include  Isaac Newton , whose  laws of motion  and illumination of  gravity  have been seen as a keystone of modern science; from the 19th century  Charles Darwin , whose theory of  evolution  by  natural selection  was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and  James Clerk Maxwell , who formulated classical  electromagnetic theory ; and more recently  Stephen Hawking , who has advanced major theories in the fields of  cosmology ,  quantum gravity  and the investigation of  black holes .\nThough  Charles Darwin \u2019s evolutionary theory was set forth in 1859 upon publication of On the Origin of Species, this work was largely absent of explicit reference to Darwin\u2019s theory applied to man. This application by Darwin would not become explicit until the publication of his second great book on evolution,  The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex , in 1871.\nDarwin\u2019s theory of organic descent placed primary emphasis on the role of natural selection but there would be nothing to select if not for variation.  Variations that are the result of mutations in the biological sense and variations that are the result of individually acquired modifications in the personal sense are attributed by Smuts to Holism; further it was his opinion that because variations appear in complexes and not singly, evolution is more than the outcome of individual selections, it is holistic.\nFollowing the  inception of   Charles Darwin 's theory of  natural selection  in 1838, the development of Darwin's theory to explain the \"mystery of mysteries\" of how new  species  originated was his \"prime hobby\" in the background to his main occupation of publishing the scientific results of the  Beagle voyage . He was settling into married life, but suffered from bouts of illness and after his first child was born the family moved to rural  Down House  as a family home away from the pressures of London.\nMany of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin's theory of evolution with  Mendel 's theories of inheritance and genetics. Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky , called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that \" Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ,\" and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs. Nevertheless, some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today:  Louis Pasteur , for example, opposed the theory of  spontaneous generation  with  biogenesis , an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on  chemical evolution  and  abiogenesis . Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.\nCharles Darwin 's publication of the  On the Origin of Species  in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx , an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen . Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.  Thomas Huxley  would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of  natural selection  as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Henry Fairfield Osborn  preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism , the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and  orthogenesis , an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.\nWallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin's theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, Darwinism, was often cited in support of Darwin's theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that the scope and claim of the theory was limited. Darwin himself had limited it.\nDarwin continued to avoid public controversy and to accumulate evidence supporting his theory against the anticipated arguments. In 1858 the information that  Alfred Russel Wallace  now had a similar theory forced an early joint  publication of Darwin's theory . The  reaction to Darwin's theory , even after publication of  On the Origin of Species  in 1859, was more muted than he had feared. One of the first responses to review copies came from  Charles Kingsley , a Christian socialist country rector and novelist, who wrote that it was \"just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which He Himself had made.\" For the second edition, Darwin added these lines to the last chapter, with attribution to \"a celebrated author and divine\".\nCharles Darwin  grew up with an interest in  natural history , and as a student at the  University of Cambridge  he became a pupil and close friend of  botany  professor  John Stevens Henslow . The year he graduated, Darwin was given a  supernumerary  position as a gentleman naturalist and geologist on the  second voyage of HMS Beagle , a trip that lasted five years. By the time he returned in October 1836, he had doubts about the doctrine that  species  were fixed and unchanging. Within months, experts informed him that specimens he had collected were separate species, not just  varieties , and the patterns he saw inspired the  inception of his theory  of  natural selection  in 1838. Darwin began editing and publishing the expert reports, collected in the  Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle , at the same time as writing a series of books on geology, the first of which was  The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs . His \"species work\" was his \"prime hobby\", a background to this writing, but it evolved into an extensive research programme during the twenty years before he  published his theory .\nPrecise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of  pangenesis . In 1865,  Gregor Mendel  reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the  independent assortment  and segregation of elements (later known as  gene s). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.  August Weismann  made the important distinction between  germ cell s that give rise to  gamete s (such as  sperm  and  egg cell s) and the  somatic cell s of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only.  Hugo de Vries  connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the  cell nucleus  and when expressed they could move into the  cytoplasm  to change the  cell s structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as  Ronald Fisher ,  Sewall Wright  and  J. B. S. Haldane  set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and  Mendelian inheritance  was thus reconciled.\nSince the publication of  Charles Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species  in 1859, the attitude of the  Catholic Church  on the theory of  evolution  has slowly been refined. Early contributions to the development of evolutionary theory were made by Catholic scientists such as  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  and the Augustinian monk  Gregor Mendel . For nearly a century, the  papacy  offered no authoritative pronouncement on Darwin's theories. In the 1950  encyclical   Humani generis ,  Pope Pius XII  confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual  soul  is a direct creation by  God  and not the product of purely material forces. , the Church supports  theistic evolution (ism), also known as evolutionary creation, although Catholics are free not to believe in any part of evolutionary theory.\nHowison, having thoroughly considered the various offerings from the history of his field (see p. 394 of \"Limits\", for example), arrived at what remains even today a unique offering. He developed his theory in the late 1880s, in consideration of another theory that was the rage of the times, Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Considering evolution in the light of the fatalistic-deterministic materialism which had come to dominate the scientific mindset from the times of Newton, in 1901 he published his magnum opus, \u201cThe Limits of Evolution, and Other Essays, Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism\u201d (2nd edition 1905), wherein he supported, amongst much else, these two positions:\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (official name: Archipi\u00e9lago de Col\u00f3n, other  Spanish  name: Islas Gal\u00e1pagos, ) are an  archipelago  of  volcanic islands  distributed on either side of the  Equator  in the  Pacific Ocean  surrounding the centre of the  Western Hemisphere ,  west of continental  Ecuador , of which they are a part. The islands are known for their vast number of  endemic species  and were studied by  Charles Darwin  during  the voyage of the Beagle , as his observations and collections contributed to the  inception of Darwin's theory  of  evolution  by  natural selection .\nRelative to the first of Darwin\u2019s theories on sexual selection, the process of female choice, though theoretically plausible, took a considerable amount of time to gain acceptance because Darwin had little, if any, firm evidence that females did in fact choose mates based on characteristics they found attractive. It took ninety years after Darwin\u2019s initial proposal for the theory to be tested in what has become a classic example of Behavioral Ecology research.\nThe 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life  is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous  Vestiges of Creation  had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and  common descent  by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.\nDarwinism is a  theory  of  biological   evolution  developed by the English  naturalist   Charles Darwin  (1809-1882) and others, stating that all  species  of  organism s arise and develop through the  natural selection  of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and  reproduce . Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of  transmutation of species  or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published  On the Origin of Species  in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories, but subsequently referred to specific concepts of natural selection, of the  Weismann barrier  or in  genetics  of the  central dogma of molecular biology . Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution,  creationists  have appropriated it to refer to the  origin of life , and it has even been applied to concepts of  cosmic evolution , both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work\u2014in place of other theories, including  divine design  and  extraterrestrial origins .\nCharles Darwin 's views on women were based on his view of natural selection. Darwin believed that the difference between males and females were partly due to \" sexual selection .\" Darwin's theory of sexual selection, which can be found in his book  The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex , states that women, and some men, will choose to mate with someone that is most suitable to culture. This proposition of sexual selection readily tied into his theory of  natural selection  in the way that evolution will have different outcomes depending on the traits of the suitor the females chooses to reproduce with. This also supports his principle of \"survival of the fittest\" in the human species.\nThe contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic. In  Randall Collins ' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ( Simmel ) and  pragmatist  ( Mead ,  Cooley ) theories of social interaction.  Utilitarianism , also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with  economics , is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by  Raewyn Connell , a tradition that is often forgotten is that of  Social Darwinism , which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily  Herbert Spencer ,  Lester F. Ward  and  William Graham Sumner . Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.\nMcCosh's most original work concerned the attempt to reconcile  evolution  and Christianity. In 1874,  Charles Hodge , the theologian and intellectual leader at the Presbyterian Seminary in Princeton,  published What is Darwinism?, claiming that  Darwinism , was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Hodge's views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. Hodge simply refused to accept that natural laws alone could create complex organisms that fit into their niches so perfectly and that evolution could explain origins. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile at the college across town (a totally separate institution) President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However in 1868, McCosh became president at the college. McCosh realized that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus demonstrated that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. McCosh thus argued that evolution, far from being inconsistent with belief in  divine design , glorifies the divine designer (see for example his Christianity and Positivism). This aspect of his work found popularity among most Presbyterians clergy, who found his arguments useful in their attempts to cope with scientific philosophy.  The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge's position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college ( Princeton University ) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.\nAlso in early 2009, the BBC broadcast an Attenborough one-hour special,  Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life . In reference to the programme, Attenborough stated that \"People write to me that evolution is only a theory. Well, it is not a theory. Evolution is as solid a historical fact as you could conceive. Evidence from every quarter. What is a theory is whether natural selection is the mechanism and the only mechanism. That is a theory. But the historical reality that dinosaurs led to birds and mammals produced whales, that's not theory.\" He strongly opposes  creationism  and its offshoot \" intelligent design \", saying that a survey that found a quarter of science teachers in state schools believe that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in science lessons was \"really terrible\".\nIn the early 20th century the  modern evolutionary synthesis  integrated  classical genetics  with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of  population genetics . The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of  biology . Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as  orthogenesis ,  evolutionism , and other beliefs about innate \"progress\" within the  largest-scale trends in evolution , became  obsolete scientific theories . Scientists continue to study various aspects of  evolutionary biology  by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing  mathematical models of theoretical biology  and biological theories, using  observational data , and performing  experiment s in both the  field  and the laboratory.\nThe philosopher  Karl Popper  held that any scientific proposition must be  falsifiable , in other words it must at least be possible to  imagine an experiment  whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis. Initially he thought that  Charles Darwin 's theory of  natural selection  (often summarized as \"the survival of the fittest\") was untestable in this sense, and therefore \"almost  tautological .\" Popper later changed his view, concluding that the theory of natural selection is falsifiable and that Darwin's own example of the  peacock 's tail had disproved one extreme variation of it, that all evolution is driven by natural selection. Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically to the theory of natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that \" Darwinism \" or \"Darwin's theory of evolution\" was a \"metaphysical research programme\" because it was not falsifiable. In fact he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on  population genetic s, the study of the relative frequencies of  allele s (different forms of the same  gene ). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled  Lamarckianism  or  saltationism , evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms. In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that \"historical sciences\" such as  paleontology  or the  history of evolution of life on Earth  were not genuine sciences, when in fact he believed they could make falsifiable predictions.\nIn Darwin's theory of  natural selection , more organisms are produced than can survive. Some have variations that give them a competitive advantage, and they have the best chance of surviving and procreating. The main element lacking in the theory was any mechanism that would allow organisms to pass on these favorable variations. Lacking such a mechanism, the theory of evolution faced competition from theories such as  neo-Lamarckism , in which the environment acted directly on organisms, changing their structures. Darwin did not know that the monk  Gregor Mendel  was already working on experiments that would explain inheritance in terms of units of heredity that we now call genes.\nThe idea of de-evolution is based at least partly on the presumption that \"evolution\" requires some sort of  purposeful direction  towards \" increasing complexity \". Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in  vestigiality  or in loss of genes. Earlier views that species are subject to \"cultural decay\", \"drives to perfection\", or \"devolution\" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory.  Early scientific theories of  transmutation of species  such as  Lamarckism  and  orthogenesis  perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that  adaptation  through  natural selection  comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less \"successful\"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of  genetics  and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by  Gregor Mendel .  Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the  modern evolutionary synthesis  or neo-Darwinism. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular  allele s. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new  mutation s. Selection also might arise from more complex  epigenetic  or other  chromosomal  changes, but the fundamental requirement is that any adaptive effect must be  heritable .\nNatural Selection is a  manuscript  written by  Charles Darwin , in which he presented his  theory  of  natural selection  and its role in biological  evolution .He did not publish the work while he was alive, but wrote an abstract, titled  On the Origin of Species  by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, which he published in 1859.\nBy the late 1860s, however, Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution had been thought to be compatible with the polygenist thesis (Stepan 1982). Darwin thus used Descent of Man to disprove the polygenist thesis and end the debate between polygeny and monogeny once and for all. Darwin also used it to disprove other hypotheses about racial difference that had persisted since the time of ancient Greece, for example, that differences in skin color and body constitution occurred because of differences of geography and climate.\nThe current theory of evolution, the  modern evolutionary synthesis  (or neo-darwinism), explains that evolution of  species  occurs through a combination of Darwin\u2019s mechanism of natural selection and  Gregor Mendel \u2019s theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance and mathematical population genetics. Essentially, the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries; the units of evolution (genes) with the main mechanism of evolution (selection).\nThe Darwin Industry has also stretched to many related figures before, during and after Darwin's time.  Darwin's grandfather  Erasmus Darwin  has been a subject of great interest, and the broad philosophical currents of  Naturphilosophie  and  Romanticism in science  during the 19th century are still being explored.  Studies of  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck ,  Georges Cuvier ,  Charles Lyell ,  Thomas Henry Huxley ,  Richard Owen ,  Alfred Russel Wallace  and many others have all been influenced to a greater or lesser degree by the work of the Darwin Industry.  Because of the unusual hybrid nature of  The Origin of Species  as both a popular and scientific work, one major focus of the Darwin Industry has been the role of popularization and education in the spread of Darwin's theory: the popular work of Huxley,  Ernst Haeckel ,  Herbert Spencer , and most dramatically,  Robert Chambers  (who wrote the 1844 sensation  Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation ), is increasingly seen as important in its own right in the  history of evolutionary thought .\nBell was at the heart of the scientific establishment and when  Charles Darwin  returned to London from the  Beagle expedition  on 2 December 1836, Bell was quick to take on the task of describing the reptile specimens. He was also entrusted with the specimens of  Crustacea  collected on the voyage. He was the authority in this field; his book British Stalke-eyed Crustacea is a masterwork. He played a significant part in the  inception of Darwin's theory  of  natural selection  in March 1837 when he confirmed that the giant  Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise s were native to the islands, not brought in by  buccaneer s for food as Darwin had thought. He supported the arrangements for publication of  Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle , but then was very slow to make progress on the work, and though the first parts of work were published in 1838, Bell's contribution on reptiles (Part 5) was published in two numbers, in 1842 and 1843, and he subsequently failed to take any action on the Crustacea.\nDarwin used this example, and others, to formulate his theories of natural selection. In a nutshell, the theory postulated that these individual isolated populations would diverge to such an extent that they would be unable to produce viable offspring if they bred, the main definition for becoming a new species.\nDarwin most often refers to: Charles Darwin (1809\u00e2\u0080\u00931882), English naturalist and writer, best known as the originator of the theory of biological evolution by natural selection. Charles Galton Darwin (1887\u00e2\u0080\u00931962), English physicist, the grandson of Charles Darwin.\nDarwin's Theory of Evolution is the widely held notion that all life is related and has descended from a common ancestor: the birds and the bananas, the fishes and the flowers -- all related. Darwin's general theory presumes the development of life from non-life and stresses a purely naturalistic (undirected) descent with modification.\nIn the early 19th century Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution. In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859).Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor.n 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor.\nCharles Darwin & the Tree of Life.

Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by Charles Robert Darwin and others, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.\nHome >> Darwin's Theory Of Evolution. Darwin's Theory Of Evolution. Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the widely held notion that all life is related and has descended from a common ancestor: the birds and the bananas, the fishes and the flowers -- all related.\nDarwin Theory of natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1858. Darwin believed all plants and animals had evolved from a few common ancestors by means of natural selection. Plants and animals produce many offspring, but some of the young die before they can become parents. According to Darwin's theory, natural selection determines which members of a species die prematurely and which ones survive and reproduce. All living things must compete for a limited supply of food, water, space, and other necessities.\nEugenics in a Nutshell. The word Eugenics means \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood genes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eugenicists believe that principles of Darwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theory regarding \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe survival of the fittest\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be used to support the elimination of weak and undesirable people from society.\nDarwin began formulating his theory of natural selection in the late 1830s but he went on working quietly on it for twenty years. He wanted to amass a wealth of evidence before publicly presenting his idea. During those years he corresponded briefly with Wallace (right), who was exploring the wildlife of South America and Asia. Wallace supplied Darwin with birds for his studies and decided to seek Darwin's help in publishing his own ideas on evolution. He sent Darwin his theory in 1858, which, to Darwin's shock, nearly replicated Darwin's own. Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker arranged for both Darwin's and Wallace's theories to be presented to a meeting of the Linnaean Society in 1858. Darwin had been working on a major book on evolution and used that to develop On the Origins of Species, which was published in 1859.\nCharles Darwin was known as the founder of the evolutionary theory. Darwin also supported and observed the theory of: Organisms have one common ancestor and have evolved throughout time.\nCharles Darwin in the Galapagos. Charles Darwin. Perhaps our first association with the word Galapagos is the name Darwin.. Darwin's visit to the Galapagos Islands had a resounding impact on the formation of his Theory of Natural Selection.\nBull Island in a Nutshell: This nature reserve and leisure beach is a paradise for birdwatchers, a good place for some beach life, a breath of very fresh air just a few minutes drive from Dublin City ... and home of the Bull Island Mouse.hen Darwin was working on his Origin of Species, the Bull Island Mouse was discovered and became one of the chief witnesses to Darwin's theories-it had evolved from the field and house mice of the vicinity, adapting to island life by changing its coat to a sandy colour.\nCharles Darwin was a naturalist. His major contribution to science was the Theory of Evolution.\nWhat was Charles Darwin big contribution? He contributed the Theory of Evolution to science. Evolution: is the change over time in one or more inherited traits found in populations of individuals.\nPrimer: Evolutionary Theory in a Nutshell. How Darwinian Evolution Works: 1. Random mutations cause changes, or variation, in a population of organisms. 2. These different organisms then compete to survive and reproduce. 3. Those which are best able to survive and reproduce do so, and tend to leave the most offspring. This is called natural selection..\nDarwin's theories led to the development of the literary school of in which characters are portrayed as being subject to natural and environmental forces? Darwin's theories led to the development of the literary school of  Naturalism in which characters are portrayed as being subject to  natural and environmental forces.\nBritish philosopher Herbert Spencer went a step beyond Darwin's theory of evolution and applied it to the development of human society. In the late 1800s, many Americans enthusiastically embraced Spencer's Social Darwinism to justify laissez-faire, or unrestricted, capitalism.In 1859, Charles Darwin published Origin of Species, which explained his theory of animal and plant evolution based on natural selection..ritish philosopher Herbert Spencer went a step beyond Darwin's theory of evolution and applied it to the development of human society. In the late 1800s, many Americans enthusiastically embraced Spencer's Social Darwinism to justify laissez-faire, or unrestricted, capitalism.\nIn the early 20th century the modern evolutionary synthesis integrated classical genetics with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics. The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of biology.n the early 20th century the modern evolutionary synthesis integrated classical genetics with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics.

Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the widely held notion that all life is related and has descended from a common ancestor: the birds and the bananas, the fishes and the flowers -- all related.\nDarwin's theory of evolution is basically 'Survival of the Fittest or Natural selection.. Genetic mutations occur in every species. Sometimes these are beneficial. For example a calf born more muscular than the rest will be more likely to mate and consequently pass on his genes to his.\nDarwin's Theory of Evolution - Natural Selection. While Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a relatively young archetype, the evolutionary worldview itself is as old as antiquity. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Anaximander postulated the development of life from non-life and the evolutionary descent of man from animal.\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and others, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.\nDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is entirely focused on an explanation of life's biological diversity. It is a scientific theory meant to explain observations about species. Yet some have used the theory to justify a particular view of human social, political, or economic conditions. All such ideas have one fundamental flaw: They use a purely scientific theory for a completely unscientific purpose. In doing so they misrepresent and misappropriate Darwin's original ideas. One such distortion and misuse is the loose collection of ideologies grouped under the label of Social Darwinism..\nSocial Darwinism: The Theory of Evolution Applied to Human Society. Social Darwinism was the application of Charles Darwin`s scientific theories of evolution and natural selection to contemporary social development. In nature, only the fittest survived\u00e2\u0080\u0094so too in the marketplace. This form of justification was enthusiastically adopted by many American businessmen as scientific proof of their superiority. Leading proponents of Social Darwinism included the following: Herbert Spencer (1820-1903). Spencer was an English social philosopher and prime advocate of Darwin`s theories, perhaps doing more than any other figure of his era to gain acceptance for the theory of evolution.\n- A Theory in Crisis.

Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the widely held notion that all life is related and has descended from a common ancestor: the birds and the bananas, the fishes and the flowers -- all related.\nSummary of Scientific Theories about Evolution before Darwin's Discovery of Natural Selection. Darwin's theory of Natural Selection is generally regarded as a significant landmark in the origin of organisms and evolution process. Before Darwin, many scientists like him alleged that species evolved from other species or antecedent.\nIn the early 19th century Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution. In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor.\nDarwin's Theory. In 1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for adaptation and speciation. He defined natural selection as the principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is preserved.n a letter to Charles Lyell in September 1860, Darwin regretted the use of the term Natural Selection, preferring the term Natural Preservation. For Darwin and his contemporaries, natural selection was in essence synonymous with evolution by natural selection.\nDarwin's Theory of Evolution - The Premise Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the widely held notion that all life is related and has descended from a common ancestor: the birds and the bananas, the fishes and the flowers -- all related.

Darwin did not come up with the theory of evolution.It predates him by centuries. He did propose the theory of natural selection (based on his observations in the Galapagos and his experience breeding pigeons) and compiled enough evidence for evolution to convince nearly the entire scientific community.elevance. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: The inception of Darwin's theory occurred during an intensively busy period which began when Charles Darwin returned from the survey voyage of the Beagle, with his reputation as a fossil collector and geologist already established.\nSo, we could say that Darwin was one of the pioneers of child psychology and development research. Lesson Summary. Charles Darwin, best known for his survival of the fittest theory, was a major contributor to the field of psychology. Darwin's theories centered around humans and animals sharing similar biological factors and ancestral roots.\nDarwin proposed pangenesis theory to complement his 1859 theory of evolution via natural selection. Darwin coined the term pangenesis, with pan- meaning whole, and genesis indicating origin. With the term pangenesis, Darwin suggested that all parts of the parents could contribute to the evolution and development of the offspring.\nGiven enough time, Darwin and Wallace argued, natural selection might produce new types of body parts, from wings to eyes. Darwin and Wallace develop similar theory Darwin began formulating his theory of natural selection in the late 1830s but he went on working quietly on it for twenty years.", "key": "56_1", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.135326", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
