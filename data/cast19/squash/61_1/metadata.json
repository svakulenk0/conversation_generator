{"input_text": "The Zodiac reappear in the Avengers, with member Taurus attempting to  extort  local  farmer s for their land. Several Avengers, aided by the hero  Red Wolf , prevent this and defeat Taurus. The title  Daredevil  features a plan by Zodiac (who are not revealed as the instigators until reappearing in Avengers) to cause  civil unrest  by inciting a  street gang  to violence in the  borough  of  Manhattan  in  New York City . The plan is stopped by Daredevil and Avenger the  Black Panther , with the two characters then featuring in title Avengers with the rest of the team to prevent a full-scale attack by Zodiac on  Manhattan . Aries is killed when Thunder God  Thor  destroys the character's escape craft.\nCaptain America is seen as the leader of the  Avengers  during the  JLA/Avengers  story. His mind affected by subtle incompatibilities between the two universes, he sees the  Justice League  as overlords who demand praise and worship in return for heroic actions. He especially gets angry at  Superman , who (likewise affected) sees the Avengers as heroes who don't do enough and let their world down. During the first confrontation, Cap and  Batman  battle but reach a standstill, Batman saying it is conceivable Cap could beat him, but asks if he wants to. The two decide to team up to solve the mystery of the game. At the  Bat-Cave  Cap comments on the fact Batman lost  a partner , possibly thinking of  Bucky Barnes . They figure out the plan after Cap gets an inter-dimensional vehicle from the FF that allow them to get to the Grandmaster's headquarters, where they encounter the  Atom , who shows them recordings of the event, revealing the Avengers are fighting for  Krona . Their intervention in the last battle, where Cap makes sure Batman can get the cube so the JLA wins the game by using his shield to get the cube from Quicksilver, causes the villain Krona to go mad and attack the Grandmaster. Cap and Batman together convince the two teams to fight Krona. The Grandmaster then causes the two universes to merge, imprisoning Krona between them. Cap is the only Marvel hero to sense reality changing and his attack on Superman, who also realises the changes, shatters the fixed reality. He commands a group of heroes from both worlds in a wintry Metropolis when they are attacked by a group of villains. He and Superman again argue after he realizes Krona, from the DC Universe is responsible for the chaos, but are stopped by  Wonder Woman . The two teams find the  Grandmaster , who shows them the way their realities are supposed to be. Despite seeing shocking revelations, the two teams decide to face Krona. Cap leads the teams as a battle tactician at Superman's suggestion, communicating orders through the  Martian Manhunter 's telepathy, and gives Superman his shield. Before the battle he and Superman apologize to each other, claiming they each have fears of doing what the other accused them of. During the battle Cap is confronted by  Prometheus  after the Martian Manhunter is brought down by chronal chaos, whom he defeats despite them uploading Batman's skills after he gets his shield back. His ideas ultimately defeat Krona, after  Flash  and  Hawkeye  are nearly killed by  Dreamslayer , he tells them to pretend they are dead and lay low, they stop Krona's plan after he has defeated all the other heroes. Cap is among the core heroes at the end when reality is restored. He and Superman salute each other as they are transported back to their own dimensions, saying they fight on.\nThe Avengers are a series of fictional  superhero  teams that have starred in  The Avengers  and related  comic book  series published by  Marvel Comics . Over the years, the teams have featured a rotating lineup composed of a large number of characters. Characters listed in bold are current members of the team.\nGarrett's first involvement with the Avengers came while he was using the identity of Triathlon, he assisted them in defeating  arms dealer   Moses Magnum . Soon after, Garrett also helped the Avengers battle Lord Templar and Pagan at the dedication ceremony of a new Triune Understanding building. The battle ended with Lord Templar and Pagan escaping. Jonathan Tremont publicly blamed the Avengers for the destruction, and then covertly set up a smear campaign against the team to suggest they were religiously intolerant and racist. Tremont then had the mercenary  Taskmaster  frame a number of Avengers for the destruction of an important Triune building. Tremont then publicly \"forgave\" the Avengers which the team grudgingly went along with to avoid further bad publicity. It was during Tremont's media event at  Avengers Mansion  that the building was attacked by a  terrorist . Triathlon aided the Avengers in defeating the terrorist. In the aftermath, Duane Freeman, the Avengers' government  liaison  suggested that the team add Triathlon as a member to quell the bad publicity that the team had recently engendered. With some animosity on both sides, Triathlon was made a member of the Avengers when their new line-up was announced to the public.\nDuring the  Time Runs Out  storyline, Ex Nihilo and his fellow Gardeners attempted to fix the decaying universe that was the result of the contraction of the Multiverse. Once on Earth, Ex Nihilo and the Gardeners were able to see its whole system and find that Earth has scars. They were offered by  Sunspot  a one-way trip to help his branch of the Avengers investigate the origin of this decay by using  A.I.M.  technology and travel across the Multiverse. Sunspot's Avengers branch traveled across numerous universes navigating the map left by the Mapmakers. After one last jump across universes that cost Nightmask's life, Sunspot's Avengers branch found themselves face to face with a fissure in time and space. From it, two  Beyonders  emerged and demanded the heroes to fall back. Upon denying their request, Sunspot's Avengers faced the Beyonders. In an attempt to reprogram one of the Beyonders, Ex Nihilo, Abyss, and rest of the Gardners sacrificed themselves.\nThe team itself was not named the \"New Avengers\" within the series. A splinter group of Avengers that chose not to comply with federal superhuman registration, the team considers itself the authentic Avengers. A concurrent government-sanctioned team gathered in the sister series  The Mighty Avengers . This series launched in early 2007 and was itself supplanted by a different government-sanctioned team in the series  Dark Avengers , which was launched in late 2008. At this time the team welcomed  Clint Barton  (recently returned from the dead) as Ronin, as well as  Doctor Strange  and  Iron Fist .\nThe first 70 issues of Avengers United reprinted Avengers Vol. 3 #5-#84 (the first 4 issues were reprinted in Marvel Heroes Reborn) as well as many issues of Avengers Vol. 1 as the classic stories. Avengers 75 was a 100-page special which reprinted Avengers #500, and saw the beginning of the \" Avengers Disassembled \" storyline. As of issue 78, the title is now printing \" New Avengers \", although it printed a  Young Avengers  story arc from issue 81 to issue 83.It has also reprinted issues of  Thor  and  Iron Man  as well as all of  Avengers Forever ,  JLA/Avengers  and Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes I and II.\nThe \" Shattered Heroes \" storyline led to several changes in the main Avengers lineup, with  Quake  and  Storm  being recruited, and the  Vision  rejoining the team. Wolverine and Spider-Man leave the main team and become more involved with the  New Avengers . During the events of the  Avengers vs. X-Men  storyline, Storm quits to side with her fellow mutants as a member of the X-Men. The Avengers dismiss Noh-Varr after he attempted to betray the team, though ultimately he did not. The conflict ends with both teams united but defeated by an unrepentant  Cyclops . A new series,  Uncanny Avengers , debuted in the flagship title of the  Marvel NOW!  initiative. The title is written by  Rick Remender  with art by  John Cassaday , and the team contains members of both the Avengers and the X-Men. As well, a biweekly Avengers title was launched, written by  Jonathan Hickman  and drawn by different artists for each story arc. Hickman also began writing New Avengers.\n[[File:Janetgiant.jpg|thumb|Janet van Dyne as Giant-Girl. From Marvel Adventures: The Avengers #13 (July 2007). Art by Leonard Kirk]]The  Marvel Adventures: The Avengers  series (set in its own continuity) features Janet van Dyne as Giant-Girl, showcasing her ability to grow rather than shrink, which she uses in combat. She is younger than her main universe counterpart and she cracks jokes along with her teammate  Spider-Man . Issue 13 of the series reveals her origin as a wealthy socialite given access to size-changing Pym particles by scientist Henry Pym (here an employee of Janet's father rather than a superhero). Her maximum size is unknown, but she grows tall enough to catch a school. Instead of having her powers naturally, Janet requires a suit powered by Pym particles to change her size. Like her  Earth-616  counterpart, Janet seems to change her costume regularly. The first costume is purple and black with a mask adorned with antennae that looks remarkably similar to the Giant-Man costume worn by Hank Pym in the mainstream universe. This costume allows her to grow while having the added effect of letting her control insects (though she never uses this power). This costume is later destroyed, and Janet wears a second costume that does not include a mask, as her secret identity had been revealed. Finally, Janet gains a third suit that allows her to both grow and shrink, with the suit changing in appearance depending on her size. While using this suit to shrink, she calls herself Wasp and has powers similar to her mainstream counterpart, such as flight, proportionally superhuman strength, and the ability to project bio-electrical stings. A recent preview of Marvel Adventures: the Avengers #19 has shown her wearing a costume which is primarily blue but has gold-yellow accents. Whether this costume increases her maximum size is yet to be seen. She also mentions that she has at least two brothers, although they have never been seen or given any names (see Marvel Adventures: The Avengers #3).\nGrim Reaper dispatched the Lethal Legion members to different locations to meet the Avengers. Power Man and Swordsman were sent to the water main below  Avengers Mansion , Living Laser and Man-Ape were sent to the nearby power station, and Grim Reaper seemingly departed to  Greenwich Village . Black Panther broke free and contacted the Avengers to warn them about the Lethal Legion's plot. Grim Reaper returns and uses the knockout gas in his scythe to knock out Black Panther while revealing that he planned to have the Avengers lured to the locations of which Black Panther knew about. While the other members of the Lethal Legion defeat the different Avengers, Vision defeats Power Man (who had been sent to capture him at Avengers Mansion). He disguises himself as Power Man and Power Man as him and takes him to the base. The Lethal Legion places the Avengers in an hourglass container and then fills it with deadly gas. When \"Power Man\" arrived with \"Vision,\" Grim Reaper detected the brain patterns of Wonder Man and shattered the hourglass to save Vision's life only to realize that the vision in the hourglass was actually Power Man. At that point, Vision aided the Avengers into defeating the Lethal Legion who are handed over to the authorities.\nDark Reign: Young Avengers is a limited series written by  Paul Cornell , with artist  Mark Brooks , which introduces a new group of powered teens calling themselves the Young Masters, but controlled by Norman Osborn. The new team is a twisted version of the Young Avengers, much like the Dark Avengers are to the original Avengers. The Young Avengers confront them, agreeing to field test the new teens for membership into their group. The final decision by the Young Avengers to only allow a select few into their ranks results in a battle where Osborn's team of Dark Avengers are ultimately involved. The Young Avengers manage to defeat both Osborn's team and their teenage counterparts, causing Osborn to withdraw and the others to stand down. Escaping, the new team dub themselves the Young Masters (a play on the name of an older villain team, the  Masters of Evil ).\nA one-issue story following the introduction of the Avengers of the Supernatural, including  Doctor Strange ,  Ghost Rider ,  Man-Thing ,  Blade ,  Satana  and  Manphibian . The Avengers of the Supernatural are chosen by  Mojo  for his newest reality show. Under mind-control, they abduct the Avengers Unity Squad from the Avengers Mansion, and once in Mojoworld, both teams are made to take part in a reality show called \"Martian Transylvania Super Hero Mutant Monster Hunter High School\". In the show, the mutants of the Unity Squad are goth outcasts, the rest are football stars and cheerleaders, and the Avengers of the Supernatural are the geeks of the High School. As part of the show, the Scarlet Witch tells Johnny Blaze she is pregnant, but the Spirit of Vengeance believes it really has an offspring. As Blaze is possessed by the spirit, he goes \"too far out of character\", and Mojo's influence over the other heroes is broken. Ghost Rider then starts rampaging through Mojoworld looking for sinner souls to punish, until Mojo convinces The Avengers to save Mojoworld, as there were numerous innocent lives. Both Avengers teams fight Ghost Rider in order to distract him, and let Satana pry the Spirit of Vengeance from Blaze and temper it. Satana fails, but Rogue manages to sneak up on Ghost Rider and absorb his powers. She becomes the new Ghost Rider and tempers the Spirit of Vengeance, but as it begins taking control of her, Blaze reabsorbs the spirit into him, becoming the Ghost Rider once more. Having controlled the Spirit of Vengeance and saved Mojoworld, the Avengers of the Supernatural and the Unity Squad return to their universes.\nAvengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel are upcoming American  superhero film s based on the  Marvel Comics  superhero team the  Avengers , produced by  Marvel Studios  and distributed by  Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures . They are intended to be the sequels to  Marvel's The Avengers  (2012) and  Avengers: Age of Ultron  (2015), and to serve as  the nineteenth and twenty-second films  of the  Marvel Cinematic Universe  (MCU) respectively. Both films are set to be directed by  Anthony and Joe Russo  from screenplays by  Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely , and feature an  ensemble cast  composed of many  previous MCU actors .\nAs 75 of the world's most dangerous super-villains are mysteriously freed en masse from the  Vault , the  Cube , the  Big House , and the  Raft , five of Earth's mightiest heroes assemble a crime-fighting alliance called the  Avengers . The Avengers' team is composed of  Iron Man  (Tony Stark) as de facto team leader,  Ant-Man/Giant-Man  (Hank Pym), the  Hulk  (Bruce Banner),  Thor , and the  Wasp  (Janet Van Dyne)  Captain America  (Steve Rogers) joins the team later after being found frozen in ice while the team is looking for a missing  Hulk .  Although other characters feature in the Avengers, these are the original and main avengers. Future members of team for season one include  Black Panther  (T'Challa) and  Hawkeye  (Clint Barton). In the season finale, it is revealed that Thor's adopted brother  Loki  was responsible for the breakouts and that he had the  Enchantress  and her servant under his control.\nAfter the comics publishing house  Marvel Comics  ventured into  movie production , they set of to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie  The Avengers  (2012). The same process was repeated for  Avengers: Age of Ultron  (2015) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the  Marvel Cinematic Universe . Inspired by Marvel's success,  Warner Bros. , who hold movie rights for  DC Comics ' heroes, announced the production of  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic  DC Extended Universe , while  Paramount Pictures  and  Allspark Pictures  announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the  Transformers  film series.\nDuring the  Heroic Age  storyline, Simon is approached by Steve Rogers to join the new team of Avengers. Simon refuses stating that the Avengers have caused more problems than they have solved and implies as Rogers leaves that he will make sure his old allies realize the mistake they are making. Simon also mentioned as having been in jail until Steve bailed him out. After learning that Rogers had disregarded his advice, Wonder Man attacks the new team causing some damage to their base before inexplicably disappearing. Thor and Iron Man later contact him to try and reason with him, but Simon refuses to listen to their arguments, stating that the dead heroes that have resulted from the Avengers working together should be a clear sign that the concept is doomed, departing as Thor and Iron Man try to argue that all heroes are aware of the risks when they begin. Significantly, Iron Man notes that Simon is 'leaking' ionic energy, suggesting that his current mental condition may relate to his powers rather than being simply a matter of choice. Wonder Man put together  Revengers , a team of super-powered people to stop the Avengers because he believe they do more harm than good, blaming the Avengers for Ultron's existence, the damage caused by the Scarlet Witch and the Hulk, the Civil War, and Osborn's Dark Avengers. His team subsequently defeats the  New Avengers  in a quick attack on the mansion before he moves on to attack  Avengers Tower , stating that he will destroy the tower unless the Avengers immediately disband. Although Iron Man manages to trap him in a prison specifically designed to contain his ionic energy with the Revengers being quickly defeated by the combined Avengers teams, Wonder Man has still successfully managed to spread doubt among the population about the merits of the Avengers as a concept particularly since Captain Rogers has yet to officially rebuff any of his arguments, asking Beast to remember his words simultaneously reflecting that he may be able to see the Avengers from the outside as he has not been 'real' since his resurrection before he apparently disappears from his prison.\nAvengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American  superhero film  based on the  Marvel Comics  superhero team the  Avengers , produced by  Marvel Studios  and distributed by  Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures . It is the sequel to 2012's  The Avengers  and  the eleventh film  in the  Marvel Cinematic Universe  (MCU).

Jackson . In Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Avengers fight  Ultron , an artificial intelligence obsessed with causing human extinction.\nThe story arc \"The Crossing\" reveals Iron Man as a traitor among the Avengers' ranks, due to years of manipulation by the time-traveling dictator  Kang the Conqueror . Stark, as a sleeper agent in Kang's thrall, kills Marilla, the nanny of  Crystal  and  Quicksilver's  daughter Luna, as well as Rita DeMara, the female  Yellowjacket , then Amanda Chaney, an ally of the Avengers. The  Avengers Forever  limited series later  retcon s these events as the work of a disguised  Immortus , not Kang, and that the mental control had gone back only a few months.\nThe Cabal appear in  Avengers Assemble  as major antagonists of the first season. In the episode \"The Avengers Protocol Pt. 2\",  Red Skull  and  MODOK  resolve to counter the Avengers by forming the Cabal. Red Skull is then seen sending his holographic messages to  Attuma ,  Doctor Doom , and  Dracula  for membership. In the episode \"The Serpent of Doom\", Doctor Doom voices his disgust at the idea of teaming with Red Skull after killing some HYDRA troops and decides not to accept the invite. In \"Blood Feud\", a recuperating Dracula is met by Red Skull where Red Skull wants Dracula to join the Cabal as he listens to Red Skull's offer to get revenge on the Avengers and to get another attempt at the Super Soldier serum in Captain America's blood. In \"Super-Adaptoid\",  Justin Hammer  creates the  Super-Adaptoid  in order to impress Red Skull enough to let him join the Cabal by using the Super-Adaptoid on the Avengers. The Avengers defeated Super-Adaptoid where Red Skull tells MODOK that Justin Hammer failed the audition while Super-Adaptoid had passed the audition. . In \"Bring On the Bad Guys\", Red Skull taps into his suit's JARVIS in order to find ways for his Cabal to become more coordinated. The first plan is for Red Skull to fake a surrender so that Attuma, MODOK (who was controlling the Super-Adaptoid at the time), and Dracula can infiltrate the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier at the time when Captain America was alone and the other Avengers are investigating Red Skull's submarine. Though the Cabal gets away after jettisoning Captain America as a diversion, the Avengers learn from Captain America that the diversion also allowed them to obtain a specific object from the Tri-Carrier. The final scene shows that the object was the cell that was holding  Hyperion  as Red Skull invites him into the Cabal as a way for Hyperion to trust him. In \"The Ambassador\", Red Skull leads the Cabal into targeting Doctor Doom at the  United Nations  in order to get even with him for not joining the Cabal. The Cabal had fought the Avengers during their mission to target Doctor Doom. After Captain America gets Doctor Doom into Avengers Tower to have his injuries treated, the Cabal retreats. In \"By the Numbers\", the Cabal competes with the Avengers in order to get to the  Tesseract . Due to Red Skull changing the coordinates of where the Tesseract landed, the Cabal manages to obtain the Tesseract and then retreat. In \"Exodus\", Red Skull orchestrates the theft of some iridium and some proto-weapons made by Justin Hammer's company in order to build a large device that is powered by the Tesseract. During the battle, Red Skull opens up four different portals with the device to four different worlds with Attuma being assigned an ocean-themed world, Dracula being assigned a world with no sunlight, Hyperion being assigned an advanced city world that would take him for granted, and MODOK and Super-Adaptoid being assigned Asgard. When Iron Man arrived at the battle with his remote-controlled armors to fight the Cabal, he used one of the armors to show that the portal would've destroyed each of the Cabal members enraging each of its members. When Red Skull is defeated by Iron Man, he grabs the Tesseract and puts it in his armor where he becomes the Cosmic Skull. In \"The Final Showdown\", MODOK transports the rest of the Cabal to Avengers Tower in order to find the resources to defeat Cosmic Skull. The Cabal ends up trapped by Tony Stark using the Avengers Tower's defenses while Black Widow and MODOK are teleported somewhere else. During the Avengers' fight with Cosmic Skull, Tony Stark ends up convincing the Cabal members into helping to fight the Cosmic Skull. When the Avengers and the Cabal get Cosmic Skull pinned down, Black Widow and MODOK arrive where MODOK removes Cosmic Skull's armor regressing him back to Red Skull while the armor returns to Iron Man. After Red Skull and the Tesseract disappear into a portal, MODOK takes over the leadership of the Cabal and teleports them away to fight the Avengers another day.\nThe Taskmaster first appeared briefly in  The Avengers  #195 (May 1980), before making his full debut in Avengers #196 (June 1980).

Each character is illustrated, and there are also pictures of some S.H.I.E.L.D. equipment and personnel.\nVolume 4 of New Avengers launched in October 2015 as a part of the  All-New, All-Different Marvel  relaunch, written by  Al Ewing  with art by  Gerardo Sandoval . The comic features a different team from the past three volumes: it focuses on  A.I.M.  (Advanced Idea Mechanics), a former super-villain group which has been rebranded as the Avengers Idea Mechanics, and their field team which has taken the name of the New Avengers.  Sunspot  is the new head of A.I.M., with  Songbird  as the field leader; other members include  Wiccan ,  Hulkling ,  Squirrel Girl ,  Pod ,  Power Man ,  White Tiger , and  Hawkeye  as an open informant for S.H.I.E.L.D. Later, there is a schism in the team: Wiccan, Hulkling and Squirrel Girl are expelled from A.I.M. and informed by Sunspot that the three of them are now what remains of the New Avengers; during the same story,  Cannonball  was revealed to be working for A.I.M. as well. Hawkeye, who had been fired from S.H.I.E.L.D., later rejoins the trio of remaining New Avengers to form a lineup jokingly called \"Wiccan's Kooky Quartet\". During the events of  Civil War II , the New Avengers assist A.I.M. on one last mission, which Hawkeye sits out for reasons of plausible deniability.\nThe first version of the Legion appears in  The Avengers  #78 (Jul. 1970); the second version in Avengers #164 (Oct. 1977); the third version in  West Coast Avengers  vol. 2, #1 (Oct. 1985); the fourth Avengers West Coast #98 (Sep. 1993) and the final version in the limited series Dark Reign: Lethal Legion #1 (Aug. 2009).  The teams were created by  Roy Thomas  and  John Buscema ;  Jim Shooter  and various artists;  Steve Englehart  and  Al Milgrom ; Roy Thomas and Tim Dzon; and  Frank Tieri  and various artists respectively.\nWonder Man debuted in the  superhero -team title  The Avengers  #9 ( cover-date d Oct. 1964), but appeared to die in that issue. Four years later, Avengers #58 (Nov. 1968) revisited the events of #9, explaining that the Avengers had electronically saved Wonder Man's mind in a computer. Wonder Man was not seen again until The Avengers #102 (Aug. 1972), where he made a cameo appearance in a comatose state. Wonder Man's body was revived by the villain  Kang  in The Avengers #131-132 (Jan.\u2013Feb. 1975), and then again by the  Black Talon  in The Avengers #152 (Oct. 1976), and finally by the  Living Laser  in The Avengers Annual #6 (1976). After this last encounter, Wonder Man finally recovered his faculties and joined the Avengers in a full-time capacity in Avengers #160 (June 1977).\nIn  Civil War  #2, the members of Young Avengers are captured by  S.H.I.E.L.D.  for not complying with the registration act. Captain America and the  Falcon  help them escape, freeing Wiccan, allowing him to teleport the group to a base only known to  Nick Fury  and a few resistance fighters. Once in Captain America's secret base, the Young Avengers join the resistance movement called Secret Avengers. In issue #3, the team follows Captain America into a trap set by Iron Man. Wiccan, along with  Cloak , is knocked out via tranquilizers while the rest of the Young Avengers joins the fight against Iron Man and the pro-registration heroes. Stature leaves the resistance after  Goliath  is killed by a clone of Thor and the Secret Avengers are forced to retreat from battle leaving Wiccan behind. However, shortly afterwards Stature registers and begins superhero training. The remainder of the team remained with Captain America. Stature is seen alongside Iron Man and the rest of the \"pro-reg\" group during the final battle between registered and rebel heroes.  Deadpool  is commissioned as a \"hero hunter\" in the war and frequently remarks how he'd like to capture \"those nubile Young Avengers\".\nIn 2011, another version of the Revengers appear in the Earth-616 universe. Formed by  Wonder Man  (whose ionic energy leaking problem has caused him to become convinced that the  Avengers  are not helping the world and that he must stop them), it consists of lesser-known heroes who he has convinced to help him as this  antihero  group. During the Revengers attack on  Avengers Mansion  where they fought the  New Avengers ,  Ms. Marvel  tries to reason with Wonder Man which doesn't work. This team manages to defeat the New Avengers and they move on to attack  Stark Tower . Wonder Man has Atlas attack Stark Tower to get their attention upon calling a press conference. After failing to reason with Wonder Man, Iron Man trapped him in a stasis container. When the Avengers do not want to fight with so many civilians nearby, Thor teleports the Revengers to Citi Field and all three teams (the main Avengers, the New Avengers, and the  Secret Avengers ) gang up on the Revengers all at once. With the Revengers imprisoned at the  Raft , each member has been interrogated with Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man watching the video feed of the interrogation.  Beast  later visits Wonder Man in his stasis container. Wonder Man insists that he is acting of his own free will and remains steadfast in his claim that the Avengers must disband before more people are hurt. He also adds something new: his realization that  Scarlet Witch  created him and that he probably is not even real. Appealing to their friendship, Wonder Man tries to extract a promise from Beast to shut the Avengers down when he realizes that Wonder Man is in the right, but a distressed Beast walks away. Various news programs are buzzing about the Avengers' lack of transparency and stonewalling tactics. Some openly speculate that the time for a self-appointed hero team is over and done. In his bubble, Wonder Man smiles and vanishes into a white light.\nWith the  Registration Act  having been revoked in the aftermath of the  Siege  of  Asgard  led by  Osborn  (who is incarcerated for his actions), Steve Rogers (the original  Captain America , returned from his alleged death) reassembles the  Avengers . Steve convinces a reluctant  Luke Cage  to be part of the new lineup after  Tony Stark  sells the reconstructed  Avengers Mansion  to Cage for a dollar, and Steve gives Cage carte blanche to maintain the New Avengers team, leading it as he sees fit. Given the freedom to recruit almost anyone he wants for the New Avengers team (except Iron Man or  Thor ), Cage selects  Clint Barton  (who has re-assumed the Hawkeye identity),  Iron Fist , Jewel (Cage's wife  Jessica Jones ),  Ms. Marvel ,  Mockingbird ,  Spider-Man , the  Thing  (who maintains concurrent membership in the Fantastic Four) and  Wolverine . Rogers also sends him  Victoria Hand  on the grounds that she can provide the team with a unique insight from which Rogers feels they will benefit. Although Hawkeye leaves the team when a crisis comes up with the main Avengers team (claiming that he only joined them to spend time with his wife), the team later enlists a now-weakened  Doctor Strange  after he assists them in tackling a dimensional crisis.  Squirrel Girl  and  Wong  are hired as a super-powered babysitter for Cage's and Jewel's baby and mansion housekeeper respectively, although they do not serve directly on the main lineup of the New Avengers. Spider-Man appears to want to leave the team prior to the  Fear Itself  event due to his distrust of Victoria Hand and his new responsibilities in the  Future Foundation , but subsequent conversations with Wolverine and Luke Cage convince him to remain an active member. After Fear Itself, the team lineup shifts, initially with the addition of  Daredevil  to the team and later with Jessica Jones leaving the team out of fear for her baby Danielle's safety.\nDuring the  Dark Reign  storyline, Ares has joined the  Dark Avengers ,  Norman Osborn 's personal team of Avengers. Writer of the Dark Avengers series,  Brian Michael Bendis , described Ares' role: \"Ares is going to be a big part of this book. He's really going to step up and use his War God brain.\" During The  Dark Avengers ' first mission, \" Venom-Spidey \" is turned into a monster by  Morgan le Fay . Venom (under her control) attempts to eat Ares. He is spit back out but is turned to stone shortly thereafter by Morgana. He returns to normal when Morgana is defeated by Dr. Doom in her own time. Ares later receives a truancy notice in the mail regarding his son. Deciding to investigate as best he can, he sends Alex to school, only to see him board  Daisy Johnson 's scooter on the way to a new base for the Secret Warriors. Ares tails them on his motorcycle and rampages his way in through the wall. When Hellfire tries to attack, Ares easily dispatches him and in their own silent way, Nick Fury and Ares ask for a private audience with one another. Ares then uncharacteristically declares himself a horrid father, but only aims to raise Alex differently than he and his father were raised. He then peacefully leaves the place behind, allowing Alex the opportunity to not have to hide his allegiance anymore.\nKang returns, attempting to win the hand of Princess  Ravonna  of a puppet kingdom, by demonstrating his power to her father by battling the Avengers, whom he kidnaps using a time machine he disguises as part of their mansion. The  Scarlet Witch  uses her power to break out of giant jars they are imprisoned in. She pulls a lever to free the others. However they are paralyzed by a device of Kang, though  Quicksilver  evades it with his speed.  Captain America  reveals himself to Kang outside the mansion, so he is sent to the future. The Avengers reform and attack Kang, who gives a signal to his army. His men attack the kingdom and finally get to the Avengers, who are defeated. Later after one of his commanders, Baltog, rebels when Kang refuses to execute Ravonna he frees the Avengers to fight with him. They get the support of a group of citizens and break into the armory. The rebellion succeeds, and Baltog is captured by Quicksilver. Kang then transports the Avengers back to their own time. However, Ravonna is mortally wounded by Baltrog, when she leaps in front of the blast meant for Kang, realizing she loved him. Baltrog is then executed, while Kang laments Ravonna. Kang was unable to revive her, so kept her body in stasis.\nHe was later recovered by the  Alpha Primitives , who cared for their fallen king. Realizing his mistake, the Unspoken plotted to return and reclaim his throne, cultivating the Xerogen Crystals, only for  Attilan  to rise into the sky. Cheated of his redemption and later learning of the silent war between the Inhumans and United States of America, the Unspoken decided to change his plans and conquer Earth, unearthing the Slave Engine and planned on transforming all humans on the planet into Alpha Primitives. In the 21st century, the Unspoken was detected in Tibet.  G.R.A.M.P.A.  interpreted this as a possible alliance between communist China and the Inhumans but were unable to identify the Unspoken. Therefore, they called in  Quicksilver , an expert on the Inhumans, and  U.S. Agent . The former recognized the Unspoken and advised that they call all the Avengers teams (consisting of the  Mighty  Avengers, the  New Avengers , the  Young Avengers , the  Avengers Resistance , and even the  Dark Avengers ) to stop him.\nMethod Studios created the interior of the new Avengers training facility by digitally designing the training facility, extracting the characters from the original set and placing them into the new CG environment. Method also contributed to Iron Man's new Mark 45 suit and played a key role in creating Scarlet Witch's CG mind control effect. Following the trend in recent years, most of the computer screens in Stark's lab, Dr Cho's laboratory, the Quinjet and other locations in the film were not added in post-production but were actually working screens on set, adding to the realism of the film and saving some on the post-production budget. London-based  Territory Studio  delivered the screen visuals filled with unique imagery and animations that matched the character using them. Perception worked on the main-on-end and main titles for the film. Before settling on the marble monument depiction for the main-on-end titles, Perception created three other versions, which were based on Ultron's hive mind ability from the film, \"renderings of power and pure energy\" inspired by classic comic panels, and classic moments for each character. The final design was inspired by war monuments such as the  Iwo Jima memorial . For the main titles, Marvel wanted the typeface to be a direct continuation of the first film. Perception made the typeface a marble texture to mimic the main-on-end titles and changed the title's rotation (away from the camera instead of towards the camera in The Avengers), before \"Age of Ultron\" overtakes \"Avengers\" in a vibranium texture.\nThe team is first seen in public by Avengers  Hawkeye  and  Mockingbird , who watch the group as they foil a robbery attempt. Although annoyed by the team's naivet\u00e9 and their use of the Avengers name without permission, Hawkeye and Mockingbird agree to act as the team's mentors. The Great Lakes Avengers assist the Avengers and West Coast Avengers from time to time, and once help them fight  Terminus . After aiding the Thunderbolts against the villain  Graviton , the GLA clash with the mercenary  Deadpool .\nSeveral months later Kang reappears, seeking the Celestial Madonna for a mate, whom he believes is on Earth. The discovery that it is the Avenger  Mantis  leads to another confrontation with the Avengers. The Avengers are aided by a futuristic version of Rama-Tut, who had returned to ancient Egypt in his old age and ruled for ten years, and then placed himself in suspended animation to revive in the 20th Century. This Rama-Tut has abandoned his identity as Kang and seeks to counsel and change his younger, conquering self. While Kang is foiled in his quest for the Celestial Madonna, Rama-Tut is unable to prevent the accidental death of the Avenger the  Swordsman . As Kang escapes, the Avenger  Hawkeye  chooses to pursue him (courtesy of Doom's time-travel machine), which results in a final battle in the Old West in 1871. Aided by the futuristic Rama-Tut once more\u2014who has evolved after a journey to  Limbo  and a study of time into  Immortus \u2014Hawkeye, Thor, and ally  Moondragon  confront Kang, with the help of the  Two-Gun Kid . In trying to defeat Thor, Kang draws on an excessive amount of energy and destroys himself.\nThis replacement Mansion would survive various assaults until, in the \" Avengers Disassembled \" storyline, the  Scarlet Witch  was responsible for its destruction by bringing an undead version of Jack of Hearts that exploded, also killing  Scott Lang , the second  Ant-Man , and in Avengers Finale (January 2005), Stark decided that with his dwindling assets, he could no longer afford to maintain the building and it was abandoned in its derelict state, left as a memorial to the Avengers who had died. Stark, using his considerable political and social influence, had the grounds declared a landmark by the city of New York. Since then, the Young Avengers have restored much of the statuary on the grounds of the mansion. The Avengers have relocated to  Stark Tower , although it is unknown how permanent this move will be, especially in light of the events of Marvel's  Civil War  storyline, which causes the virtual splitting of the New Avengers down the line between those who were pro- registration  and those who were against it.\n[[Image:MarvelSuper-Heroes17.jpg|thumb|left| Marvel Super-Heroes  #17 (Nov. 1968).

Since Whitman was not a full Avenger at the time, Kang had no power over him, and so Whitman was able to defeat him with relative ease. Whitman then officially joined the Avengers in recognition of his aid. Later the Ebony Blade was used by the Olympian war god  Ares , to put out the Promethean Flame and turn most of the Olympians to crystal. Black Knight travelled to Olympus with other members and helped defeat Ares.\nIn 1943, the Black Avenger was among a number of heroes who were slain by the  Cosmic Cube -wielding  Red Skull  and impaled on a massive wall. However, the Cosmic Cube was recovered by Private Paul Anslen who resurrected all the slain heroes who aided the combined efforts of the  Invaders  and the time displaced  New Avengers  and  Mighty Avengers . When Red Skull was defeated, the heroes used the Cosmic Cube to wipe out the Black Avenger's memories of the event to preserve history/\nThe New Avengers became a splinter group that chose not to comply with federal superhuman registration, as opposed to the governmental-sanctioned team presented in  Mighty Avengers  then  Dark Avengers .

After Wanda is rescued, Pietro and his sister rejoin the team. During one mission Quicksilver is wounded by a Sentinel and is found by  Crystal , a member of the  Inhumans . Crystal nurses Pietro back to health, and the pair are eventually married. Pietro and Wanda also meet Robert Frank\u2014formerly  World War II  hero, the  Whizzer \u2014who was present at Mount  Wundagore  (the birthplace of the siblings) with his wife at the time of their birth. Frank briefly joins the Avengers, believing Pietro and Wanda to be his children. The Scarlet Witch also becomes romantically involved with her Avengers teammate the android  Vision . Although Pietro initially disapproves, he eventually gives his blessing to their marriage.[[File:Avengers 16 May 1965.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of  Avengers  #16 (May 1965), featuring the debut of Quicksilver (center left) in The Avengers.]]Quicksilver features with the Inhumans and Fantastic Four against the villain the  Sphinx  in a Fantastic Four annual, and the siblings' origin is explored in the title Avengers when  romani  Django Maximoff kidnaps Pietro and Wanda and returns to  Mount Wundagore  in the country of  Transia , where they were born.

Seeking answers, he downloads the remnants of the destroyed  Vision 's operating system into his armor.  This reveals a  fail-safe  plan created by the android to reform the Avengers should they disband or fall in action by locating the next generation of Avengers, all whom have some tie to the original team. Using this plan, Nate assembles his new team, the  Young Avengers , with the sole purpose of defeating his future self and reshaping his own future. He models his armor after the Avenger  Iron Man , calling himself Iron Lad. He forms a brief romantic relationship with fellow Young Avenger teammate  Stature .\nWhen  Iron Man  (Tony Stark) called the  Avengers ' first meeting and donated the Stark house as the  Avengers Mansion  headquarters, Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years thereafter, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. Jarvis was there for the first guest, the time-lost  Captain America  (Steve Rogers), to be a member of the Avengers. He was the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even Captain America can claim. As a result, Captain America has stated that Jarvis should be  regarded  just as much of an Avenger as he is.\nIn the miniseries  JLA/Avengers , Iron Man aids the Avengers in the battle against  Starro the Conqueror . Afterwards, he creates a dimensional alarm in order to tell when invaders from another dimension come into their universe. After a brief scuffle with the JLA in the Savage Land, the Avengers are confronted by  Metron , who gives Tony a  Mother Box .

When we did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be.\" In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in  Phase Two  of the MCU, by saying, \"After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in  The Winter Soldier . So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [Avengers: Age of Ultron]. Where we go after that, we'll see.\" In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said \"we'll see.

At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel:  Jon Favreau  was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films\u2014Iron Man 2,  Thor  (2011), and  Captain America: The First Avenger  (2011)\u2014at their  Manhattan Beach, California  complex.  Lou Ferrigno , who voiced Hulk in The Incredible Hulk, stated that he would be involved in the film. In February 2009,  Samuel L. Jackson  signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man 2 and other films. In September 2009,  Edward Norton , who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would \"definitely have input and a say\". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, \"It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced  Emily Blunt  in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The female superhero  Wasp  was included in an earlier draft of the script written before Johansson's involvement. The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.\nDuring the  Avengers Forever  storyline, the Avengers of Earth-9105 appeared in the  Avengers Forever  storyline. The Time-Keepers used the Forever Crystal to summon Avengers from divergent realities that had turned dark and destructive as part of a plot to destroy the Avengers. The Avengers of Earth-9105 were among these Avengers and were manipulated by the Time-Keepers to kill the Avengers. The Avengers of Earth-9105 were seen on the battlefield fighting the various alternate Avengers. When Captain America shattered the Forever Crystal to thwart the plans of the Time-Keepers, the Avengers of Earth-9105 were among the Avengers that were returned to their native realities.\nA  flashback  sequence explains that the Avengers detect an alarm from the  Baxter Building , the headquarters of the  Fantastic Four . The Avengers arrive at the building and find Mar-Vell using the portal to the Negative Zone\u2014created by  Reed Richards \u2014to try and free Rick Jones from their need to \"share  molecules \" (alternating between the same space, one on Earth and one trapped in the Negative Zone until swapping). Mar-Vell is successful, although while the portal to the Zone is open the Avengers are forced to drive back the entity  Annihilus , who attempts to escape the Zone. Mar-Vell takes advantage of the distraction to steal the Avengers  quinjet , which is tracked once the Avengers realize that the Kree hero has absorbed a lethal amount of radiation. The flashback ends and the group are then attacked by a  robot   Sentry , who captures Mar-Vell and escapes. The Avengers are questioned by Mar-Vell's former colleague,  Carol Danvers .\nThe Avengers/Ultraforce event was a two-part  intercompany crossover  between  Malibu Comics  and  Marvel Comics . The first issue,  Avengers / Ultraforce , was written by  Glenn Herdling  with art by  Angel Medina  and  M. C. Wyman . The sequel, Ultraforce/Avengers, was written by  Warren Ellis  with art by  George P\u00e9rez , who also illustrated wraparound covers on both issues.\nThe Avengers is the name of several  comic book  titles featuring the team the  Avengers  and published by  Marvel Comics , beginning with the original The Avengers comic book series which debuted in 1963.\nA humanized version of the Avengers banded together during the  Age of Apocalypse  and were known as the Human High Council.\nThe Avengers: United They Stand (also known simply as The Avengers) is an animated series based on the  Marvel Comics  superhero team  The Avengers . It consists of 13 episodes, which originally premiered on October 30, 1999, and was produced by  Avi Arad  and distributed by  20th Century Fox Television .

The roster includes  Skaar ,  Gorgon ,  Ai Apaec , Dr.  June Covington ,  Superia , and  Trickshot . The team is backed up by  HYDRA  and  A.I.M.  Norman Osborn also has A.I.M. rebuild  Ragnarok  so that he can join the Dark Avengers. Although Osborn claims to be certain that his new team is superior to their \"templates,\" he appears unaware that  Madame Hydra  and Gorgon are already planning to kill him once he proves himself to be too dangerous as leader, intending to use his team to sow discord by serving as a voice of the \"disenfranchised\" unsatisfied with the status quo. The subsequent fight against the New Avengers proves to be relatively evenly matched. Although Osborn demonstrates a surprising new level of strength allowing him to throw Luke Cage a considerable distance and his  Scarlet Witch  injures  Doctor Strange , the others are able to hold their own far more easily. When they attempt to teleport away, the New Avengers end up facing Ragnarok. Spider-Man and  Iron Fist  are able to defeat Ragnarok, but the Dark Avengers' actions have still damaged the New Avengers' reputations by tricking them into provoking a fight with a team who just helped the civilians, Osborn's other forces attacking the main team to charge them with various war crimes, ordering the President to declare Osborn the new head of world security and put the Avengers on trial.\nThe  Marvel Cinematic Universe  is a  media franchise  and  shared   fictional universe  that is the setting of  superhero film s independently produced by  Marvel Studios , based on characters that appear in  Marvel Comics  publications.

The original Zemo received an entry in the original  Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  #13, the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #16, and the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe 2004 Book of the Dead.\nIn the wake of \"Avengers Disassembled\", two new Avengers series were created. The  New Avengers  title replaced the Avengers title (with a new No. 1 in December 2004) which ended with issue No. 503 and Avengers Finale (November 2004). This new title continued with the creative team of writer  Brian Michael Bendis  and artist  David Finch . The other title, premiering February 2005, was  Young Avengers , which featured teenage heroes, each of whom (excepting  Hawkeye ) related in some way to the legacy of the Avengers. This series was written by  Allan Heinberg , a writer for  The OC , with art by  Jim Cheung . The group was revived by its creators in July 2010 with the bimonthly series  Avengers: The Children's Crusade  which is a follow-up to Disassembled and  House of M .\nThe Avengers and West Coast Avengers changed to allow members to be active when available and reserved when not available and merged the two separate Avengers teams into one team with two bases. The Vision had his personally fundamentally altered, along with the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision were actually illusions. The loss of the Scarlet Witch's children and the Vision, who was disassembled by government agents in retaliation for the Ultimate Vision storyline, drove her insane, although she eventually recovered and rejoined the team. This story revealed that the Scarlet Witch's powers included wide-range reality manipulation and she was what the time-traveling Immortus refers to as a \"nexus being\" setting the stage for 2004's eventual Chaos and Avengers Disassembled storylines. This played out in the Darker than Scarlet storyline which ran in Avengers West Coast from issues #51\u201362 (Nov. 1989\u2013Sept. 1990). The Avengers titles in late 1989 were involved in the major crossover event \" Acts of Vengeance \" where Loki assembled many of Marvel's arch-villains, his inner circle consisted of Doctor Doom,  Magneto ,  Kingpin ,  Mandarin ,  Wizard , and  Red Skull , in a plot to destroy the team. Loki orchestrated a mass breakout of villains from prison facility, the  Vault , as part of his \"Acts of Vengeance\" scheme, but he ultimately failed in his goal to destroy the Avengers.\nThe Young Avengers is a  fictional   Marvel Comics   superhero  team, appearing in comic books published by  Marvel Comics .  The team, created by  Allan Heinberg  and  Jim Cheung , features numerous adolescent characters who typically have connections to established members of Marvel's primary superhero team, the  Avengers . The Young Avengers originally featured in a twelve issue run, later appearing in several notable Marvel crossover series, including the  Civil War  and  The Children's Crusade  events, before the series was relaunched in January 2013 as part of the  Marvel NOW!  rebranding by writer  Kieron Gillen  and artist  Jamie McKelvie .\nNoh-Varr is a fictional  superhero  appearing in  comic books  published by  Marvel Comics . He first appears in  Marvel Boy  #1 (August 2000). He appeared in the  Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways  and the  New Avengers: Illuminati  limited series. After his appearance in  Secret Invasion , he joins the  Dark Avengers  as  Captain Marvel . He joins the  Young Avengers  in 2013.\nSecret Avengers is an  American   comic book   series  published by  Marvel Comics  featuring a  fiction al  black ops   superhero  team of the same name. The series started with  Ed Brubaker  on writing duties, depicting a black-ops sect of Marvel's premiere super hero team, the  Avengers , which operates under the guidance and leadership of  Captain Steve Rogers  (the former Captain America). The series is part of the Avengers-line relaunch as part of the \" Heroic Age \".\n[[File:AvengersVolume2.jpg|thumb|The Avengers vol. 2, #11 (Sept. 1997), showing the  Heroes Reborn  Avengers. Cover art by  Michael Ryan  and  Sal Regla .]]The U.S. government revoked the Avengers' New York State charter in a treaty with the Soviet Union. The Avengers then received a charter from the United Nations and the Avengers split into two teams with a substitute reserve team backing up the main teams.\nAn alternate version of Brother Voodoo appears as the leader of the Avengers of the Undead, the team of Avengers from Earth-666. He first appears when the mainstream version of  Captain Britain  entrusts the team with the Orb of Necromancy, a powerful artifact that he wishes to keep hidden. When Captain Britain and  Hawkeye  attempt to reclaim the Orb, the Avengers of the Undead double-cross the heroes and attempt to kill them.\nMarvel Animation  has made three Avengers films,  Ultimate Avengers ,  Ultimate Avengers 2 , and  Next Avengers .\nOriginally assembled by Coat of Arms as an examination of superheroism art project during the  Dark Reign  storyline, the group was largely motivated by  Melter  II's desire to be real heroes, but hindered significantly by unclear and conflicting ideals including  Executioner  II's  Punisher -style ruthlessness, Big Zero's racism and violent tendencies,  Egghead  II's psychopathy and hedonism, and Coat of Arm's distorted view of ethics. Only Melter II and  Enchantress  II showed much interest in actual altruistic heroism. The team began calling themselves the \" Young Avengers ,\" but were only active as superheros a short time before being confronted by the real Young Avengers. The Young Avengers fought their darker counterparts where they vetted each member. Although Enchantress was a possible candidate for the original Young Avengers, she was rejected due to having a history with  Loki . Displeased with the Young Avengers' decision, the team decided to become the Young Masters. Executioner contacted  Norman Osborn  to gain his support and the backing of the  Dark Avengers . When the Young Avengers returned to their headquarters, the Dark Avengers showed up. The Young Masters aided the Young Avengers into fighting the Dark Avengers. After the Dark Avengers were repelled, the Young Masters left.\nThe Avengers are a common narrative plot thread in the films of the  Marvel Cinematic Universe , beginning as early as  Iron Man  wherein the \"Avengers Initiative\" was introduced.\nAfter Quicksilver saved the Avengers from Kobik's grasp and spread them out throughout Pleasant Hill, they discovered that the two Maria Hills that the Avengers and the Avengers Unity Division were actually the villains Mindblast and  Bloodlust  who had been used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to keep the Avengers away from Pleasant Hill. When the inmates started noticing the two Avengers teams and started attacking them,  Deadpool  reached out to Kobik where he used their shared past of being controlled to get empathy from her. Kobik brought both teams back to good health just in time for them to answer Steve Rogers' call to assist him.\nThe Avengers vol. 3 relaunched and ran for 84 issues from February 1998 to August 2004. To coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering, and The Avengers #500-503 (Sept.\u2013 Dec. 2004), the  one-shot  Avengers Finale (Jan. 2005) became the \" Avengers Disassembled \" storyline and final issues. In January 2005, a new version of the team appeared in the ongoing title  The New Avengers , followed by  The Mighty Avengers ,  Avengers: The Initiative , and  Dark Avengers . Avengers vol. 4 debuted in July 2010 and ran until January 2013. Vol. 5 was launched in February 2013. After  Secret Wars , a new Avengers team debuted, dubbed the All-New, All-Different Avengers, starting with a  Free Comic Book Day  preview.\nLuchino Nefaria is a wealthy Italian  aristocrat  and traditionalist that also desires greater wealth and power, driving him to join the  Maggia  criminal organization. The recently formed  Avengers  superhero team, however, thwart many of his plans and force a direct conflict, so Nefaria lures the Avengers to his castle on the pretence of a charity event, and places the group in suspended animation, using images which threaten to take control of America. After he releases them, the Avengers become suspicious of him after hearing they are wanted and they cannot remember what happened at the castle. They go to the castle, however nearly all of them are paralyzed by Nefaria's gas. Meanwhile, the  Teen Brigade  were captured by Nefaria, and when they tried to contact the Avengers were thrown in a dungeon which would place them into suspended animation if they touched the walls.  Captain America  gets into the castle without touching the ground, other Avengers, or walls, and freed the Teen Brigade, who gave the antidote to the Avengers. Captain America was also paralyzed, and with his hands and feet attached to ropes he was suspended between floor and ceiling, where Nefaria mocked him, saying he would be a hero for capturing him. However, Iron Man then burst through the wall. Neferia was defeated and deported after an officer heard him confess to being in the Maggia. In retaliation, Nefaria then unsuccessfully attempts to destroy  Iron Man , and then suffers yet another defeat when stopped by the  mutant   X-Men  team. Nefaria reappears several years later and attempts to take control of the United States base  NORAD , but is stopped by the X-Men once again. Nefaria attempts to escape in a plane which is attacked by the X-Man  Thunderbird . The plane then explodes, killing Thunderbird and injuring Nefaria.\nIn  Captain America: Civil War , which is loosely based on the \"Civil War\" comics, the public opinion of the Avengers and all superpowered beings worsens following the climactic battles of  Marvel's The Avengers ,  Captain America: The Winter Soldier  and  Avengers: Age of Ultron . The Inhuman Outbreak in  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  makes the bigotry worse. After a catastrophe in Lagos, involving  Scarlet Witch  using her powers to divert an explosion from  Crossbones , destroying a building and killing several humanitarian workers from  Wakanda , the United Nations are trying to pass a set of internationally ratified legal documents that provide regulation and frame-working for the military/law enforcement deployment of enhanced individuals, particularly the Avengers, called the Sokovia Accords. The Accords divide the Avengers, leading  Captain America  to come into conflict with  Iron Man , who believes that the Avengers need to be held responsible for their actions, especially after he created  Ultron  and was responsible for the destruction in Sokovia, while Captain America believes that the Accords will restrict the Avengers' freedom. This leads to them each forming their own sides as they battle over the Accords, as well as  Winter Soldier  being framed for the bombing at the UN by  Helmut Zemo . This eventually results in both sides of the conflict fighting at the Leipzig/Halle Airport, with Iron Man,  War Machine ,  Spider-Man ,  Black Widow ,  Black Panther  and  Vision , against Captain America, Winter Soldier,  Falcon ,  Hawkeye ,  Scarlet Witch , and  Ant-Man , with Iron Man and  Thaddeus Ross  locking up Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man in  The Raft  for opposing the Accords. At the end of the film, Steve breaks them all out, with Tony - who was appalled at how his former comrades were being treated - willingly letting the breakout occur without interference from his side. The Accords were mentioned in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season three episode \" Emancipation \" and have play through the show's fourth season.\nThe New Avengers is a fictional team of superheroes appearing in  comic books  published by  Marvel Comics . The title has been used for four  American  comic book  series . The first two were written by  Brian Michael Bendis  and depicted a version of Marvel's premiere superhero team, the  Avengers . The third was written by  Jonathan Hickman  and depicted a group of characters called the  Illuminati  (formerly introduced in New Avengers Vol. 1 #7 [July 2005]). The fourth is written by  Al Ewing  and depicts the former scientific terrorist group  A.I.M. , reformed as \"Avengers Idea Mechanics\", whose field team has appropriated the name \"New Avengers\" for itself.\nHe also had designed four massive vehicles for the  Avengers  of his world to use, which could combine (in a manner resembling old fashioned combining super robots like  Combattler V  and  Voltes V ) into a skyscraper-sized Iron Man- mecha  (Dubbed Ultimate Iron Man in its first appearance, then the Iron Avenger in its battle with the Hulk and finally simply called \"the Avenger's mecha\" in Volume 2 of the series). Unfortunately it was quickly destroyed by that world's Hulk. Apparently, however, it was rebuilt again by the time of the second volume, this time as a single robotic unit without transformation (or, if it was capable of transformation, it was never demonstrated). This unit helped fight off the giant  Galactus  spores, but was later destroyed, along with most of the Avengers, single handedly by the Mangaverse version of  Dr. Doom .\nAvengers Assemble is an American  animated television series  based on the fictional  Marvel Comics  superhero team known as the  Avengers . Designed to capitalize on the success of the 2012 film,  The Avengers , the series premiered on  Disney XD  on May 26, 2013, as the successor to  The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes .\n[[File:Avengers 2010.jpg|thumb|The \"Heroic Age\" roster of the Avengers. Cover art for Avengers vol. 4, #12.1, by  Bryan Hitch .]]The next iteration of the Avengers roster consisted of  Thor ,  Hawkeye ,  Spider-Man ,  Wolverine ,  Captain America ,  Spider-Woman ,  Iron Man , and team leader  Maria Hill .  Steve Rogers , briefly eschewing his Captain America persona, grants these \"New Avengers\" recognition as an official team independent of  Stark's more traditional Avengers. Bucky Barnes as Captain America joined the main Avengers, as did Iron Fist,  Power Woman , and the  Thing . Rogers was an occasional presence and  Victoria Hand  was added with his backing.\nIron Man, in the series  The Mighty Avengers , formed a team under the aegis of the government's  Fifty State Initiative  program, and took up residency in New York City, joined by  Ares , the  Black Widow , the Sentry, the  Wasp ,  Wonder Man , and leader Carol Danvers as  Ms. Marvel . After the events of the  Secret Invasion  story arc,  Norman Osborn  assumed control of the formerly S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored Avengers, now under the auspices of his own agency, H.A.M.M.E.R. All but Ares and the Sentry left this team \u2014 the Wasp appeared to have died \u2014 and the team migrated to the series  Dark Avengers . Osborn recruited  Marvel Boy  to pose as Captain Marvel and  Daken  to pose as his father,  Wolverine , bringing Moonstone, Bullseye, and Venom from his previous  Thunderbolts  team to impersonate Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man, respectively.\nThe remaining New Avengers band together with  Doctor Strange  when the Ghost of  Daniel Drumm  returns. He possesses each of the New Avengers and kills various evil sorcerers. Convinced that Daniel set his brother ( Brother Voodoo ) up to fail in his new role, Doctor Strange defeats him by using dark magic (recognizing that Drumm had only killed dark magic specialists while trying to frame Strange). As a result, Doctor Strange subsequently regains his position of Sorcerer Supreme.\nThe Avengers  is a team of  comic book   superhero es in the  Marvel Comics   universe . Since 1963, they have starred in several ongoing series, as well as a large number of  limited series  and specials. All stories are published exclusively by  Marvel Comics  under their standard imprint, unless otherwise noted.\nPete Tamlyn reviewed Avengers Assembled! for  Imagine  magazine. He opined that \"Avengers Assembled! will be an essential product for most players of the game\". He stated: \"Personal preferences aside, the Avengers are probably the ideal group to choose if you are going to run an extended campaign using MSH. There have been so many members and roster changes that your players are almost certain to be able to pick a character each without conflict over who plays which particular favourite, or someone getting lumbered with a character that doesn't suit their style of play.\" He continued: \"There are a few grossly powerful characters among them, and I'd recommend that  Thor  in particular be kept as an  NPC  who can rescue the players in times of dire emergency, but the only real wimps,  Wasp  and  Hawkeye , are among the most interesting characters to play. My only complaint is that many of the villains are also very tough, the sort of folks who take on the Avengers single-handed and are normally only defeated thanks to their arrogance and over-confidence, and will therefore be quite difficult for the  GM  to handle.\" Tamlyn concluded by saying: \"Overall, a much-needed publication which will sell very well.\"\nEros returned to Titan to help console his  cancer -stricken friend Mar-Vell when he retreated to Titan to spend his final days.  Just before he died, Mar-Vell made Eros promise to take care of his Titanian companion,  Elysius , after he was gone.  Eros honored his vow for several weeks, until Elysius, realizing his wanderlust, released him from his promise. He left Titan and Elysius for Earth. He arrived on Earth, where he sought out and joined the Avengers as a trainee.  They admitted him to their training program and the  Wasp  gave him the name Starfox, since they felt Eros was an inappropriate code-name. He then went on his first mission with the team, against  Annihilus . He helped the Avengers vanquish the  Wizard . He helped resuscitate the  Vision  with the help of ISAAC, and was later made a full Avenger. While on the team he had his first meeting with the Earth Eternals. Eventually, he revealed his pleasure-stimulating powers to the assembled Avengers, and helped them defeat  Maelstrom . He traveled to another dimension with  Spider-Man . He then helped the Avengers defeat  Terminus . He battled the space pirate  Nebula , and learned of her claim to be the granddaughter of Thanos. He left the Avengers with  Firelord  to pursue Nebula. He eventually encountered and was defeated by the Xandarian villain  Supernova  who blamed Nebula for the destruction of his homeworld.  Eventually he found Nebula. He was held captive by Nebula, but freed himself, and assisted the Avengers and the  Stranger  against Nebula.\nThe heroes include the  Avengers  ( Captain America ,  Captain Marvel  II,  Hawkeye ,  Iron Man  II,  She-Hulk ,  Thor , the  Wasp ); three members of the  Fantastic Four  ( Human Torch ,  Mister Fantastic  and  Thing ); solo heroes  Spider-Man ,  Spider-Woman  II and the  Hulk ; and the mutant team  X-Men  ( Colossus ,  Cyclops ,  Nightcrawler ,  Professor X ,  Rogue ,  Storm ,  Wolverine , and  Lockheed the Dragon ).  Magneto  is featured as a hero, but immediately becomes non-aligned when the Avengers question his presence.\nBoth the Young Avengers and the Runaways are opposed to the  Superhuman Registration Act , but each team enters into the \"Civil War\" in a different way. The Young Avengers are based in  New York City , the epicenter of the war, and they are acutely aware of the Act from the beginning. They are eventually captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., but they are rescued and recruited by  Captain America  and his \"Secret Avengers\". The Runaways are based in  Los Angeles , which has few superhumans and is far from Captain America and his resistance, who are unable to make their presence felt in L.A. However, government-sponsored enforcers are deployed in L.A. to capture any West coast superhumans. The Runaways don't keep up with current events and maintain a position of indifference and laissez-faire until they are engaged by S.H.I.E.L.D. enforcers.\nThe first time the Avatars were featured in  Marvel Comics  was in  War Machine  #6, the members stood behind  Mandarin (comics)  as he lost to  Iron Man  and War Machine. The first time this team was featured in action was in  Force Works  #8. The members have the first attack on Hong Kong, but defeated by Force Works. The next issue was in Iron Man #311, where  Mandarin  creates the most recent character, Turmoil. Turmoil was the only character that was created, and this was by Ancestor. He found a peasant and set a curse onto him. This curse had him harness the power of a storm. Then these Avengers face off against  Spider-Woman  and  US Agent . But the Avengers are defeated. In Iron Man #312, Iron Man infects Deluge with an aging virus, and turns him into dust. In a new series,  Civil War: Battle Damage Report  #1, the Avengers switch their service to Mandarin's son. Mandarin was killed during the explosion of \"Dragon of Heaven,\" where the avatars then switched their alliance to his son. The final showing of these Avengers was in  Heroes For Hire  II #1, where the Avengers attacked New York City, but were defeated finally by the Heroes for Hire.\n[[File:Hawkeye 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hawkeye displaying his redesigned costume on the cover of Hawkeye (2012) #2. Art by  David Aja .]]Following the  Fear Itself  storyline, the  Avengers Academy  is reopened in  Palos Verdes  at the former West Coast Avengers headquarters, where Barton accepts an offer to become a teacher. The character receives a new costume in Avengers vol. 4, #19 (November 2011).  Cullen Bunn , writer of Captain America & Hawkeye, stated the costume was influenced slightly by  The Avengers . In 2012, Hawkeye becomes the leader of the  Secret Avengers . The  critically acclaimed  Hawkeye vol 4 focuses on Hawkeye defending an apartment building from the Russian mob with the assistance of Kate and his brother Barney.\nKate also appears alongside the other Young Avengers in Avengers: The Children's Crusade Young Avengers, a one-shot in which the Young Avengers are grown up and are now the Avengers. It is an alternate timeline altered by Iron Lad continuing to alter the timestream to defeat Kang the Conqueror.\nAs previously mentioned, the Avengers roster for the cartoon is loosely based upon the roster for the 1984 Avengers spin-off series  The West Coast Avengers . Notably absent from the lineup are the traditional core members: Captain America,  Iron Man , and  Thor , who were originally prohibited from appearing in the series due to licensing issues. Story editor Eric Lewald has commented on their absence and had said \"We want this to be a team of Avengers, instead of making it 'Captain America and the Avengers' or 'Thor and the Avengers. We prefer to have a balanced team of superheroes rather than a superstar on the team.\" However, Captain America and Iron Man each made one guest appearance (in \"Command Decision\" and \"Shooting Stars\", respectively), while Thor did not appear outside of the opening sequence.\nA mystical incident had caused all those who were once Avengers to be targeted by creatures and monsters. Vance and Angelica accompanied their friend Rage, who had been an Avenger, to a meeting at Avengers Mansion. They willingly helped out in various ways before Morgan LeFay attacked, altering reality. Vance and Angelica were caught up in the literal mystical maelstrom and were turned into super-powered enforcers under the command of LeFay. However, several Avengers managed to break free of the control, based on their deep belief in the team itself. Vance found himself coming to his senses despite never being an Avenger, a fact that surprised the remaining heroes; thus, he joined the resistance.\nHenry Gyrich is the first person to be given the title of U.S. Government  Liaison  to the  Avengers  by the  National Security Agency  later by the  National Security Council . With his status, Gyrich is one of only two people (the other being the  President of the United States ) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways.

Cover art for Avengers vol. 4, #12.1, by  Bryan Hitch .]]All four Avengers series (The Mighty Avengers, New Avengers, Dark Avengers, and Avengers: The Initiative) were canceled, and a new ongoing series titled Avengers was launched in May 2010, written by Brian Michael Bendis and penciled by  John Romita Jr. .\nReturning to work for  Cross Technological Enterprises  as Head of Security, Hawkeye meets the former  S.H.I.E.L.D.  agent Barbara \"Bobbi\" Morse, also known as the hero  Mockingbird . Together, they discover that  Crossfire , cousin of the company\u2019s original owner, was hatching a plot to destroy the superhero community via an aggression-inducing sonic weapon. Hawkeye and Mockingbird manage to defeat him (although Hawkeye is rendered  deaf  when he uses a sonic arrow to counter Crossfire's weapon) and the two heroes get married shortly afterwards. At the direction of then-Avengers chair the Vision, Hawkeye (now using a  hearing aid ) and Mockingbird travel to  Los Angeles  to establish a west coast branch of the Avengers, known as the  West Coast Avengers . While searching for a base of operations, Hawkeye and Mockingbird battle a vengeful Crossfire, who had recently broken out of prison. They manage to defeat the supervillain, aided by former actress  Moira Brandon , who later allows her mansion to become the new Avengers Compound. On one of the West Coast Avengers adventures, when the team was lost in time, Mockingbird was kidnapped by an  Old Western  hero called Lincoln Slade, the  Phantom Rider . The Phantom Rider drugs Mockingbird, convinces her that they are in love, and forces her to engage in a sexual relationship. Mockingbird soon regains her senses. In the resulting battle between the two, Mockingbird allows the Phantom Rider to fall to his death. Afterwards, when Mockingbird confesses what she did, Hawkeye is stunned that his wife would allow a man to die instead of facing justice. Their relationship becomes frayed as Mockingbird leaves the West Coast Avengers and separates from Hawkeye.\nTheir next encounter with the West Coast Avengers occurs in Avengers: West Coast. The team is led by Hangman, who calls on  Satannish . The powers of the team are greatly increased, but in the end they are defeated anyway.\nOther classic storylines included \" The Bride of Ultron \", the \" Nefaria  Trilogy\", and \"The  Korvac  Saga\", which featured nearly every Avenger who joined the team up to that point.  Henry Peter Gyrich  became the Avengers' liaison to the  United States National Security Council . Gyrich was prejudiced against superhumans and acted in a heavy-handed, obstructive manner, and insisted that the Avengers followed government rules and regulations or else lose their priority status with the government. Among Gyrich's demands was that the active roster be trimmed down to only seven members, and that the  Falcon , an  African American , be admitted to the team to comply with  affirmative action  laws. This last act was resented by Hawkeye, who because of the seven-member limit lost his membership slot to the Falcon. The Falcon, in turn, was unhappy to be the beneficiary of what he perceived to be  tokenism , and decided to resign from the team, after which Wonder Man rejoined. The true origins of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were revealed in a three-part story that ran in issues #185-187 (July-Sept. 1979). After this adventure, the Scarlet Witch took a leave of absence and  Ms. Marvel  officially joined the team as her replacement.\n\"Avengers Disassembled\", is a  crossover  event involving  the Avengers ,  Fantastic Four ,  Captain America ,  Spider-Man  and  Thor . \"Avengers Disassembled\" saw the beginning of  Brian Michael Bendis 's Avengers run, with the destruction of the existing \"traditional\" roster and exile of several  key members of the team. The other crossover stories intersect (or in the case of the Spectacular Spider-Man and Thor crossover issues) or take place prior or after to the main Avengers storyline. In particular, the tie-ins saw other changes to the status quo: Iron Man once again closeting his secret identity, Spider-Man developing organic webshooters (like the Sony Spider-Man movies), and the death of Thor and Asgard in one final Ragnarok.\nA few The Avengers-related comic books have been published in the USA.
