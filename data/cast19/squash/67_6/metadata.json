{"input_text": "Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a disorder characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), movement problems, increased susceptibility to infection, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function. The anemia in this condition begins in infancy. Since the anemia results from the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic anemia. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. When the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. The movement problems are caused by impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. This impairment leads to muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), tremors, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Affected individuals may also develop seizures. Weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. Individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells. These immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The most common infections in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. People with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often do not survive past childhood due to respiratory failure. In a few rare cases, affected individuals without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood. The deficiency is most commonly caused by mutations in TPI1, although mutations in other isoforms have been identified. A common marker for TPI deficiency is the increased accumulation of DHAP in erythrocyte extracts; this is because the defective enzyme no longer has the ability to catalyze the isomerization to GAP. The point mutation does not affect the catalysis rate, but rather, affects the assembly of the enzyme into a homodimer.\nAnemia, also spelled anaemia, is usually defined as a decrease in the total amount of  red blood cell s (RBCs) or  hemoglobin  in the  blood . It can also be defined as a lowered ability of the blood to carry  oxygen . When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include  feeling tired , weakness,  shortness of breath  or a poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms, which may include confusion,  feeling like one is going to pass out , loss of consciousness, or increased thirst. Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably  pale . Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause.\nThe symptoms of ALL are indicative of a reduced production of functional blood cells, because  leukemia  wastes the resources of the  bone marrow  that are normally used to produce new, functioning blood cells. These symptoms can include fever, increased risk of infection (especially bacterial infections like  pneumonia , due to  neutropenia ; symptoms of such an infection include  shortness of breath , chest pain, cough, vomiting, changes in bowel or bladder habits), increased tendency to bleed (due to  thrombocytopenia ), and signs indicative of  anemia , including  pallor ,  tachycardia  (high heart rate), fatigue, and headache.\nComplications of Menorrhagia could also be the initial symptoms. Excessive bleeding can lead to anemia which presents as fatigue, shortness of breath,and weakness. Anemia can be diagnosed with a blood test.\nThe diagnosis of hemolytic anemia can be suspected on the basis of a constellation of symptoms and is largely based on examination of a  peripheral blood smear  and a number of laboratory studies. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include those that can occur in all anemias as well as the specific consequences of hemolysis. All anemias can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased ability to exercise when severe. Symptoms specifically related to hemolysis include  jaundice  and dark colored urine due to the presence of  hemoglobin  (hemaglobinuria). When restricted to the morning hemaglobinuria may suggest  paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria . Direct examination of blood under a microscope in a  peripheral blood smear  may demonstrate red blood cell fragments called  schistocytes , red blood cells that look like spheres ( spherocytes ), and/or red blood cells missing small pieces ( bite cell s). An increased number of newly made red blood cells ( reticulocytes ) may also be a sign of  bone marrow  compensation for anemia. Laboratory studies commonly used to investigate hemolytic anemia include blood tests for breakdown products of red blood cells,  bilirubin  and  lactate dehydrogenase , a test for the free hemoglobin binding protein  haptoglobin , and the direct  Coombs test  to evaluate  antibody  binding to red blood cells suggesting  autoimmune hemolytic anemia .\nThe symptoms of AML are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in  red blood cell s,  platelet s, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several  risk factors  and  chromosomal abnormalities  have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.\nHaptoglobin is ordered whenever a patient exhibits symptoms of  anemia , such as  pallor , fatigue, or shortness of breath, along with physical signs of hemolysis, such as  jaundice  or dark-colored urine.  The test is also commonly ordered as a hemolytic anemia battery, which also includes a  reticulocyte  count and a  peripheral blood smear .  It can also be ordered along with a  direct antiglobulin test  when a patient is suspected of having a  transfusion reaction  or symptoms of  autoimmune hemolytic anemia .  Also, it may be ordered in conjunction with a  bilirubin .\nMost people do not have  symptoms . It can cause a mild to moderate enlargement of the  spleen ,  splenomegaly , as well as  hemolytic anemia  (which is the form of anemia due to abnormal breakdown of red blood cells prematurely). Too much hemoglobin C can reduce the number and size of  red blood cells  in the body, causing mild  anemia . Occasionally,  jaundice  may occur. Some persons with this disease may develop  gallstones  that require treatment. Continued  hemolysis  may produce pigmented gallstones, an unusual type of gallstone composed of the dark-colored contents of red blood cells.\nIron-deficiency anemia, also spelled iron-deficiency anaemia, is  anemia  caused by a  lack of iron . Anemia is defined as a decrease in the amount of  red blood cell s (RBCs) or  hemoglobin  in the  blood . When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include  feeling tired , weakness,  shortness of breath  or poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms which may include:  confusion ,  feeling like one is going to pass out , and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably  pale . There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause.\nThe symptoms of pernicious anemia come on slowly. Untreated, it can lead to neurological complications, and in serious cases, death. Many of the signs and symptoms are due to anemia itself, when anemia is present. Symptoms may consist of the triad of tingling or other skin sensations ( paresthesia ), tongue soreness ( glossitis ), and  fatigue  and general weakness. It presents with a number of further common symptoms, including  depressive mood , low-grade  fever s,  diarrhea ,  dyspepsia , weight loss,  neuropathic pain ,  jaundice , sores at the corner of the mouth ( angular cheilitis ), a look of exhaustion with pale and dehydrated or cracked lips and dark circles around the eyes, as well as brittle nails, and thinning and early greying of the hair. Because PA may affect the nervous system, symptoms may also include difficulty in  proprioception , memory changes, mild cognitive impairment (including difficulty concentrating and sluggish responses, colloquially referred to as  brain fog ), and even psychoses, impaired urination, loss of sensation in the feet, unsteady gait, difficulty in walking,  muscle weakness  and clumsiness. Anemia may also lead to tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), cardiac murmurs, a yellow waxy  pallor , altered blood pressure ( low  or  high ), and a  shortness of breath  (known as \"the sighs\"). The deficiency also may present with thyroid disorders. In severe cases, the anemia may cause evidence of congestive heart failure. A complication of severe chronic PA is  subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord , which leads to distal sensory loss (posterior column), absent ankle reflex, increased knee reflex response, and extensor plantar response. Other than anemia, hematological symptoms may include  cytopenia s, intramedullary  hemolysis , and pseudothrombotic microangiopathy. Pernicious anemia can contribute to a delay in physical growth in children, and may also be a cause for delay in puberty for adolescents.\nAnemia goes undetected in many people and symptoms can be minor. The symptoms can be related to an underlying cause or the anemia itself.Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of  weakness  or  tired , and sometimes poor concentration. They may also report  shortness of breath  on exertion.  In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing  cardiac output .  The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as  palpitation s,  angina  (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent  claudication  of the legs, and symptoms of  heart failure .On examination, the signs exhibited may include  pallor  ( pale   skin , lining  mucosa ,  conjunctiva  and  nail beds ), but this is not a reliable sign.  There may be signs of specific causes of anemia, e.g.,  koilonychia  (in iron deficiency),  jaundice  (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells \u2014 in hemolytic anemia), bone deformities (found in  thalassemia  major) or  leg   ulcers  (seen in  sickle-cell disease ).In severe anemia, there may be signs of a  hyperdynamic circulation :  tachycardia  (a fast heart rate),  bounding pulse ,  flow murmurs , and  cardiac   ventricular hypertrophy  (enlargement).  There may be signs of  heart failure . Pica , the consumption of non-food items such as ice, but also paper, wax, or grass, and even hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency, although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of  hemoglobin .Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced academic performance in children of school age.  Restless legs syndrome  is more common in those with  iron-deficiency anemia .\nDo you feel tired and weak? The two most common symptoms of anemia are fatigue and weakness. Anemia is a condition wherein you have a lower than normal number of red blood cells in your blood or the red blood cells in your blood don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein, which gives your blood that red color.\nBlood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion. Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells. Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.\nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death.\nThe symptoms of pernicious anemia can vary amongst individuals, depending on the cause, the severity of anemia, and other factors. Direct symptoms of pernicious anemia are due to a lack of red blood cells, which are vital to carrying oxygen to the cells of the body.Symptoms can include pale skin, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, headache, cold hands and feet, heart palpitations, and chest pain.ore information about symptoms of Pernicious anemia and related conditions: 1  Other diseases with similar symptoms and common misdiagnoses. 2  Tests to determine if these are the symptoms of Pernicious anemia. 3  Symptoms that may be caused by complications of Pernicious anemia. 4  Underlying causes of Pernicious anemia.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells.

People who have mild anemia, from a mild iron deficiency, for instance, may not have any symptoms at all, while people with severe anemia can have much more noticeable and longer lasting symptoms. Anemia symptoms include: 1  Fatigue.2  This is by far the most common anemia symptom. 3  You may feel very tired or weak and unable to summon the energy for most daily activities. 4  Dizziness. 5  Dizziness is most likely to occur when you stand up from a sitting or resting position.6  Shortness of breath.nemia symptoms include: 1  Fatigue. 2  This is by far the most common anemia symptom. 3  You may feel very tired or weak and unable to summon the energy for most daily activities. 4  Dizziness. 5  Dizziness is most likely to occur when you stand up from a sitting or resting position. 6  Shortness of breath.\nBlood disorders can cause various symptoms in almost any area of the body. Most commonly, symptoms are caused by decreases in the blood components. Decreased red blood cells and hemoglobin can cause symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath (see Overview of Anemia). Decreased white blood cells or immune system proteins can cause recurrent fever and infections (see Fever in Adults).\nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness).

Blood cells and platelets are produced in the bone marrow. In leukemia, white bloods cells fail to mature properly. These immature cells continue to reproduce at a rapid rate, crowding out healthy cells and producing a host of symptoms.nemia. Red blood cells help to distribute oxygen throughout the body. Overcrowding makes it difficult to produce enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia. Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, and rapid breathing. Some children also report feeling weak or lightheaded.\nAnemia develops when the body does not produce enough red blood cells or red cells are lost due to bleeding or other causes. In people with anemia, the blood is unable to supply enough oxygen to the body. There are many possible causes of anemia.Symptoms of anemia can include: 1  Fatigue. 2  Weakness. 3  Dizziness.hysicians in the Benign Hematology Program specialize in evaluating patients with abnormal blood counts to identify the cause of their condition and create a personalized treatment plan.\nAnemia is a condition that develops when your  blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If  you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is  abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't  getting what they need to function properly. .3 people found this useful.ernicius Anemia is when your body is unable to absorb the Vitiman B12, which is what your body needs to produce red blood cells.

Anemia is a decrease in the mass of red blood cells, the result of lack of production, loss of red blood cells, or destruction of red blood cells. There are two types of anemia: regenerative and non-regenerative. In non-regenerative anemia, the cause is usually a decrease in erythropoietin (a hormone controlled by the kidneys that influences red blood cell production as a response to low oxygen in tissues) or bone marrow abnormalities. The bone marrow does not effectively respond to the decrease levels of red blood cells.\nSymptoms include lethargy, jaundice, fever, pale mucous membranes, and abnormal pulses.

Severe Reaction to a Blood Transfusion. You may develop hemolytic anemia due to a blood transfusion. This can happen if the transfused blood is a different blood type than your blood. Signs and symptoms of a severe reaction to a transfusion include fever, chills, low blood pressure, and shock.\nThe symptoms of anemia vary according to the type of anemia, the underlying cause, the severity and any underlying health problems, such as hemorrhaging, ulcers, menstrual problems, or cancer. Specific symptoms of those problems may be noticed first.nemia Caused by Chronic Red Blood Cell Destruction. Anemia caused by chronic red blood cell destruction may include these symptoms: 1  Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes). 2  Brown or red urine. 3  Leg ulcers. 4  Failure to thrive in infancy. 5  Symptoms of gallstones.\nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.

Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death. Blood is made up of many parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (PLATE-lets), and plasma (the fluid portion of blood).\n1 Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia (reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the body) due to the body's inability to absorb vitamin B-12 from the gastrointestinal tract.  Symptoms from anemia are a result of the decreased capacity of the blood to carry oxygen and include fatigue and shortness of breath.\nDiseases of the red blood cells include many types of anemia, a condition in which there are too few red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen throughout the body. People with anemia may have red blood cells that have an unusual shape or that look normal, larger than normal, or smaller than normal. Symptoms of anemia include tiredness, irregular heartbeats, pale skin, feeling cold, and, in severe cases, heart failure.\nBecause there are low numbers of red blood cells, not enough oxygen reaches the body's tissues.

Symptoms of anemia include: 1  weakness and fatigue. 2  pale skin. 3  shortness of breath with physical activity.  lightheadedness or dizziness.\nPeople who have mild anemia, from a mild iron deficiency, for instance, may not have any symptoms at all, while people with severe anemia can have much more noticeable and longer lasting symptoms. Anemia symptoms include: 1  Fatigue. 2  This is by far the most common anemia symptom. 3  You may feel very tired or weak and unable to summon the energy for most daily activities. 4  Dizziness. 5  Dizziness is most likely to occur when you stand up from a sitting or resting position. 6  Shortness of breath.\nAnemia is a lower than normal red blood cell count or the lack of hemoglobin in your red blood cells, resulting in a wide range of symptoms. Anemia can cause fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, and a number of other symptoms. There are several different types of anemia, such as dietary deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia and megaloblastic anemia.\nAnemia is a process, not a disease, and is the most common disorder of the blood. Anemia occurs when the amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying protein in the blood) in the blood becomes low, causing the tissues of the body to be deprived of oxygen-rich blood.here are also many other symptoms that can accompany the symptoms of anemia, depending on the disease, disorder or condition that is causing anemia. Complications of anemia can be serious, even life-threatening. Underlying diseases, disorders or conditions of anemia can also cause complications.\nOther symptoms of anemia can include bleeding, vomiting blood, black tarry stools (melana), fever, severe bone pain, abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of appetite, and depression.Symptoms can also include flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea.Because anemia is a symptom of an underlying disease, condition or disorder, some of which can be serious, any symptoms of anemia should be evaluated by a physician or other licensed health care provider....more about Anemia \u00c2\u00bb.ymptoms can also include flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Other symptoms include brittle nails, shortness of breath, and chest pains. Blood oxygen levels can be so low that a person with severe anemia can have a heart attack. A physical exam that your doctor does may show: 1  high or low blood pressure. 2  pale skin. 3  jaundice. 4  increased heart rate. 5  heart murmur. 6  enlarged lymph nodes.\nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body.nemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated.\nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts. Also, the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal.

Symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia are related to decreased oxygen delivery to the entire body and may include: Being pale or having yellow sallow skin; Unexplained fatigue or lack of energy; Shortness of breath or chest pain, especially with activity; Unexplained generalized weakness\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms. More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.\nAnemia is a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin in the blood, or a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen. When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include feeling tired, weakness, shortness of breath or a poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms, which may include confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, loss of consciousness, or increased thirst.\nThe two most common symptoms of anemia are fatigue and weakness. Anemia is a condition wherein you have a lower than normal number of red blood cells in your blood or the red blood cells in your blood don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein, which gives your blood that red color.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells.

Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms.\nPrimary myelofibrosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the bone marrow, the tissue that produces blood cells. Because of the fibrosis, the bone marrow is unable to make enough normal blood cells. The shortage of blood cells causes many of the signs and symptoms of primary myelofibrosis. Initially, most people with primary myelofibrosis have no signs or symptoms. Eventually, fibrosis can lead to a reduction in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A shortage of red blood cells (anemia) often causes extreme tiredness (fatigue) or shortness of breath.\nBlood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells.
