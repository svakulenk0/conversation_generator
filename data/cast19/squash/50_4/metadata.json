{"input_text": "The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) with an operational name of NAVIC (\"sailor\" or \"navigator\" in  Sanskrit ,  Hindi  and many other Indian languages, which also stands for NAVigation with Indian Constellation) is an autonomous regional  satellite navigation  system that is being set up by  India , that will be used to provide accurate real-time positioning and timing services over India and the region extending to  around India. The NAVIC system will consist of a constellation of 3 satellites in  Geostationary orbit  (GEO), 4 satellites in  Geosynchronous orbit  (GSO), approximately  altitude above earth surface, and two satellites on the ground as stand-by, in addition to ground stations. The system was developed because access to foreign government-controlled  global navigation satellite system s is not guaranteed in hostile situations, as happened to the Indian military in 1999 when it was dependent on the American  Global Positioning System  (GPS) during the  Kargil War . The Indian government approved the project in May 2006.\nA global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allows small electronic receivers to determine their location such as longitude, latitude, and altitude to within a few meters using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites in outer space. Receivers on the ground with a fixed position can also be used to calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments. The first such system was  Transit , developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory under the leadership of Richard Kershner. Development of the system for the United States Navy began in 1958, and a prototype satellite,Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960 by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The last Transit satellite launch was in August 1988.\nCyclops UK is a long standing supplier to  Garmin , the largest satellite navigation brand in the world. All Garmin satellite navigation units come pre-loaded with Cyclops content.\nThis is a list of satellites in  geosynchronous orbit . These satellites are commonly used for  communication  purposes, such as  radio  and  television network s,  back-haul , and  direct broadcast .  Traditional  global navigation  systems do not use geosynchronous satellites, but some  SBAS  navigation satellites do.  A number of  weather satellite s are also present in geosynchronous orbits. Not included in the list below are several more classified military geosynchronous satellites, such as  PAN .\nGLONASS-K is the latest satellite design intended as a part of the Russian  GLONASS  radio-based  satellite navigation  system. Developed by  ISS Reshetnev  (Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems) and first launched on 26 February 2011, it is a substantial improvement of the previous GLONASS-M second-generation satellites, having a longer lifespan and better accuracy.\nGLONASS (, ; \u0413\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430; transliteration ), or \"Global Navigation Satellite System\", is a space-based  satellite navigation system  operating in the  radionavigation-satellite service  and used by the  Russian Aerospace Defence Forces . It provides an alternative to  GPS  and is the second alternative navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision.\nIRNSS-1E is the fifth out of seven in the  Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS)  series of satellites after  IRNSS-1A ,  IRNSS-1B ,  IRNSS-1C  and  IRNSS-1D . The satellite is one among the seven of the IRNSS constellation of satellites launched to provide navigational services to the region. The satellite was placed in  geosynchronous orbit . IRNSS-1E has been successfully launched into orbit on January 20, 2016\nThere are at least six  satellite navigation  systems, all of which function by transmitting  time signal s. Of the only two satellite systems with global coverage,  GPS  calculates its time signal from an epoch, whereas  GLONASS  calculates time as an offset from  UTC , with the UTC input adjusted for  leap seconds . Of the only two other systems aiming for global coverage,  Galileo  calculates from an epoch and  Beidou  calculates from UTC without adjustment for leap seconds. GPS also transmits the offset between UTC time and GPS time, and must update this offset every time there is a  leap second , requiring GPS receiving devices to handle the update correctly. In contrast, leap seconds are transparent to GLONASS users.The complexities of calculating UTC from an epoch are explained by the  European Space Agency  in Galileo documentation under \"Equations to correct system timescale to reference timescale\"\nIn 1960, the US Navy put into service its  Transit  satellite based navigation system to aid in ship navigation. From 1960 to 1982, as the benefits were proven over time, the US military consistently improved and refined its satellite navigation technology and satellite system. In 1973, the US military began to plan for a comprehensive worldwide navigational system which eventually became known as the GPS (global positioning system). In 1983, in the wake of the tragedy of the downing of the  Korean Airlines Flight 007 , an aircraft which was shot down while in Soviet airspace due to a navigational error, president Reagan announced that the navigation capabilities of the existing military-GPS system were to be made available for dual civilian use, however, civilians were to initially only be given access to the slightly degraded \" Selective Availability \" positioning signal.\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based  global navigation satellite system  that provides reliable,  three-dimensional  positioning, navigation, and timing services to worldwide users on a continuous basis in all weather, day and night, anywhere on or near the Earth. 24 satellites orbit around the Earth twice a day, transmitting signaled information to  GPS receivers  that take this information and use triangulation to calculate the user's exact location. Ultimately, the GPS is the descendant of the United States Navy's  Timation  satellite program and the United States Air Force's 621-B satellite program. The invention of GPS was a collaborative and team effort. The basic architecture of GPS was devised in less than a month in 1972 by Colonel  Bradford Parkinson , Mel Birnbaum, Bob Rennard, and Jim Spilker. However, Richard Easton, a son of  Roger Easton  who was the head of the U.S. Navy's Timation program, claims that his father invented GPS and filed U.S. patent #3,789,409 in 1974. Other names listed by Richard Easton are James Buisson, Thomas McCaskill, Don Lynch, Charles Bartholomew, Randolph Zwirn and, \"an important outsider,\" Robert Kern.  Ivan Getting , while working at  Raytheon , envisioned a satellite system similar to MOSAIC, a railroad mobile ballistic missile guidance system, but working more like  LORAN . The GPS program was approved in December 1973, the first GPS satellite was launched in 1978, and by August 1993, 24 GPS satellites were in orbit. Initial operational capability was established in December of that same year while in February 1994, the  Federal Aviation Agency  (FAA) declared GPS ready for use.\nMultilateration is a common technique in  radio navigation  systems, where it is known as  hyperbolic navigation . These systems are relatively easy to construct as there is no need for a common clock, and the difference in the signal timing can be measured visibly using an  oscilloscope . This formed the basis of a number of widely used navigation systems starting in  World War II  with the British  Gee  system and several similar systems introduced over the next few decades. The introduction of the  microprocessor  greatly simplified operation, greatly increasing popularity during the 1980s. The most popular hyperbolic navigation system was  LORAN-C , which was used around the world until the system was shut down in 2010. Other systems continue to be used, but the widespread use of  satellite navigation  systems like  GPS  have made these systems largely redundant.\nThe  International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO) calls this type of system a  satellite-based augmentation system  (SBAS). Europe and Asia are developing their own SBASs, the Indian  GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation  (GAGAN), the  European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service  (EGNOS) and the Japanese  Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System  (MSAS), respectively. Commercial systems include  StarFire  and  OmniSTAR .\nThe mentioned QZSS TKS technology is a novel satellite timekeeping system which does not require on-board atomic clocks as used by existing navigation satellite systems such as GPS,  GLONASS  or the planned  Galileo  system. This concept is differentiated by the employment of a synchronization framework combined with lightweight steerable on-board clocks which act as transponders re-broadcasting the precise time remotely provided by the time synchronization network located on the ground. This allows the system to operate optimally when satellites are in direct contact with the ground station, making it suitable for a system like the Japanese QZSS. Low satellite mass and low satellite manufacturing and launch cost are significant advantages of this system. An outline of this concept as well as two possible implementations of the time synchronization network for QZSS were studied and published in Remote Synchronization Method for the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System and Remote Synchronization Method for the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System: study of a novel satellite timekeeping system which does not require on-board atomic clocks.\nOn 22 August 2014,  Arianespace  launched the first two Full Operational Capability  Galileo  satellites for the European  satellite navigation  system.\nParus satellites are produced by  JSC Information Satellite Systems  (formerly NPO PM), based on the  KAUR-1   satellite bus . They have a mass of around , and a design life of 18\u201324 months. The satellites operate in  low Earth orbit s, typically with a  perigee  of about , an  apogee  of  and 82.9\u00b0  inclination . They are operated by the  Russian Aerospace Defence Forces , and are used primarily for navigation,  Store and forward  communication, and to relay data from  US-P  satellites. Some of the navigation functions are believed to have been superseded by the  GLONASS  system.\nIndian Space Research Organisation  (ISRO) is contributing towards augmenting  ESA   Galileo satellite navigation system  and GPS service in northern Europe by sharing data from the  Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System  (IRNSS). ISRO  Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle  has launched  Miniaturized satellite s of several European universities and opened payload capacity on Indian  CubeSat s to European scientific experiments. India relies on  Arianespace  for the launch of  I-3K -class satellites to geosynchronous transfer orbits.\nAll  satellite navigation  systems use satellites with precision clocks. The satellite transmits its position, and the time of the transmission. The receiver listens to four satellites, and can figure its position as being on a line that is tangent to a spherical shell around each satellite, determined by the  time-of-flight  of the radio signals from the satellite. A  computer  in the receiver does the math.\nOther military satellite guidance systems include: Russian  GLONASS , Chinese  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System , regional  Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System , Japanese regional  Quasi-Zenith Satellite System .\nA  satellite navigation  system is a system of  satellite s that provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. It allows small  electronic  receivers to determine their location ( longitude ,  latitude , and  altitude / elevation ) to high precision (within a few metres) using  time signal s transmitted along a  line of sight  by  radio  from  satellite s. The signals also allow the electronic receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system (GNSS).\nThis involves a transition from inertial navigation to satellite navigation using the GPS satellites.  This also introduced the concept of actual navigation performance (ANP).  Previously, flight crews would be notified of the system being used to calculate the position (radios, or inertial systems alone).  Because of the deterministic nature of the GPS satellites (constellation geometry), the navigation systems can calculate the worst case error based on the number of satellites tuned and the geometry of those satellites. (Note: it can also characterize the potential errors in other navigation modes as well).  So, the improvement not only provides the airplane with a much more accurate position, it also provides an alert to the flight crew should the actual navigation performance exceed the  required navigation performance  (RNP).\nu-blox develops and sells chips and modules that support global satellite navigation systems ( GNSS ), including receivers for  GPS ,  GLONASS ,  Galileo_(satellite_navigation) ,  BeiDou  and  QZSS . The wireless range consists of  GSM -,  UMTS - and  CDMA2000  and  LTE  modules, as well as  Bluetooth - and  WiFi -modules. All these products enable the delivery of complete systems for location-based services and  M2M  applications (machine-to-machine communication) in the  Internet of Things , that rely on the convergence of 2G/3G/4G, Bluetooth-, Wi-Fi technology and satellite navigation.\nMany  artificial satellites  carry retroreflectors to be tracked from  ground stations .Some satellites were built solely for laser ranging.Other satellites include retroreflectors for orbit calibration, such as in  satellite navigation  (e.g., most  GLONASS satellites  and a few  GPS satellites ) as well as in  satellite altimetry  (e.g.,  TOPEX/Poseidon ).Retroreflectors can also be used for inter-satellite laser ranging (e.g.,  GRACE-FO ).\nAviaconversiya () was a  Russia n manufacturer of surface-based  electronic countermeasures  products, namely  satellite navigation system s deceivers.\nIRNSS-1F is the sixth navigation satellite out of seven in the  Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System  (IRNSS) series of satellites after  IRNSS-1A ,  IRNSS-1B ,  IRNSS-1C ,  IRNSS-1D  and  IRNSS-1E . The satellite is one among the seven of the IRNSS constellation of satellites launched to provide navigational services to the region. It was launched aboard a  PSLV -XL rocket bearing flight number C32 and was successfully put into geosynchronous orbit at 1601  IST  on 10 March 2016.\nThe superiority of satellite navigation systems to astronomical navigation are currently undeniable, especially with the development and use of GPS/NAVSTAR. This global satellite system\nIn October 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik.  Scientists at  Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory  took a series of measurements of Sputniks  doppler shift  yielding the satellite's position and velocity.  This team continued to monitor Sputnik and the next satellites into space, Sputnik II and Explorer I.  In March 1958 the idea of working backwards, using known satellite orbits to determine an unknown position on the Earth's surface began to be explored.  This led to the TRANSIT satellite navigation system.  The first TRANSIT satellite was placed in polar orbit in 1960.  The system, consisting of 7 satellites, was made operational in 1962.  A navigator using readings from three satellites could expect accuracy of about 80 feet.\nThe ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability. The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires.\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System or GNSS is the term for satellite navigation systems that provide positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allow small  electronic  receivers to determine their location ( longitude ,  latitude , and  altitude ) to within a few metres using  time signal s transmitted along a  line of sight  by  radio  from  satellite s.  Receivers on the ground with a fixed position can also be used to calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments.\nA satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses  satellite s to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small  electronic  receivers to determine their location ( longitude ,  latitude , and  altitude / elevation ) to high precision (within a few metres) using  time signal s transmitted along a  line of sight  by  radio  from satellites. The system can be used for navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.\nThree main navigational aids assist pilots with navigation: very high frequency omnidirectional range facilities (VOR), a Loran-C, and a global positioning system (GPS).  These can only be used with properly equipped aircraft.  Although IFP does not have a VOR on the field, there are three at airports nearby: Kingman VOR/DME (distance measuring equipment) is to the east, Needles VORTAC (military tactical air navigational aids) is to the south, and Goffs VORTAC is to the west.  GPS does not need facilities on the ground for navigational guidance because it uses satellites orbiting the earth to triangulate the aircraft\u2019s position.  Loran-C basically works the same way as a GPS, but with ground-based facilities around the country.  Therefore, IFP does not have any navigational aids on the Airport property.site preparation and drainage for extend runway 16 34 1000 has been complet\nThe original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications. Satellite navigation allows the precision in the delivery of weapons to targets, greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons. (See  Guided bomb ). Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily, reducing the  fog of war .\nGLONASS-M (), also known as Uragan-M () ( GRAU  Index 11F654M and manufacturing code 14F113) are the second generation of Uragan satellite design used as part of the  Russia n  GLONASS  radio-based  satellite navigation  system. Developed by  ISS Reshetnev  (Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems), it had its debut launch in 2003, and is in the process of being phased out. Its production is expected to finish in 2015 and as of July, 2015, its last launch is expected in late 2017. It is an evolution of the previous  Uragan  ( GRAU  Index 11F654) second-generation satellites, improving accuracy, increasing power, extending the design life and adding the FDMA L2OF open signal. The last eight Glonass-M spacecraft in production include new CDMA L3OC open signal.\nFaculty has rich tradition in space technologies and astronautics. All former Czechoslovak and then Slovak astronauts were first trained in this institution (former Air Force Academy of General Milan Rastislav Stefanik). One of the main projects in space sector is a close co-operation in project of the first Slovak  cubesat  skCube. At present there is possibility to focus on study and research in various areas of space technologies, but these are mainly as part of the PhD doctoral program. One of the latest space technology projects is the dissertation of \"Theoretical Concept of Satellite Navigation System for Mars\", named as Mars GNSS FATIMA (from acronym Fix And TIme provisioning system for MArs). One of the main specializations in space technology is also the GNSS - Global Navigation Satellite Systems.\nThe first satellite navigation system was  Transit , a system deployed by the US military in the 1960s. Transit's operation was based on the  Doppler effect : the satellites travelled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-known  frequency . The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver. By monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval, the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite, and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellite's orbit can fix a particular position.\nA radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy. This is what is done in  satellite navigation systems  such as the  Global Positioning System .   GPS ,  Galileo  and  GLONASS   satellite navigation system s have one or more caesium, rubidium or hydrogen maser atomic clocks on each satellite, referenced to a clock or clocks on the ground. Dedicated timing receivers can serve as local time standards, with a precision better than 50 ns. The recent revival and enhancement of  LORAN , a land-based radio navigation system, will provide another multiple source time distribution system.\nIRNSS-1G was the seventh and final of the  Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System  (IRNSS) series of satellites after  IRNSS-1A ,  IRNSS-1B ,  IRNSS-1C ,  IRNSS-1D ,  IRNSS-1E  and  IRNSS-1F . This system of satellites will provide navigational services to the Indian region. The satellite was placed in geosynchronous orbit successfully on April 28, 2016 at 12:50\u2013pm  IST .\nAlthough any  satellite navigation  receiver that is performing its primary navigational function must have an internal time reference accurate to a small fraction of a second, the displayed time is often not as precise as the internal clock. Most inexpensive navigation receivers have one  CPU  that is multitasking. The highest-priority task for the CPU is maintaining satellite lock\u2014not updating the display. Multicore CPUs for navigation systems can only be found on high end products.\nSupporters of the Cospas-Sarsat system are preparing to demonstrate and evaluate a new capability called MEOSAR (Medium Earth Orbit Search and Rescue satellites), consisting of  SAR  transponders aboard navigation satellites of Europe, Russia and the United States.  In its current (project) form, the U.S. space-segment component is being called the  Distress Alerting Satellite System  (DASS) by  NASA .  MEOSAR will consist of  SAR  transponders aboard Europe's  Galileo  constellation, Russian Glonass spacecraft ( Glonass-K 1 having been launched on 26 February 2011), and the U.S.  GPS  satellite constellation.  MEOSAR assets will report signals from Cospas-Sarsat  search and rescue   beacon s in the 406.0\u2013406.1 MHz band.  MEOSAR satellites will be able to provide near-instantaneous detection, identification, and location determination of 406 MHz beacons.  The beacon can transmit coordinates of its position encoded in the alert message (if the position information is available from an on-board  GNSS  receiver or another source such as a ship's navigation sensors).  Or the position can be determined independently by the receiving LUT by analyzing the frequency-difference-of-arrival (related to  Doppler -induced variations) and/or the time-difference-of-arrival.  It is planned that the MEOSAR system will be able to download information back to the  distress radiobeacon  by encoding \"Return Link Service\" messages into the Galileo navigation data stream.\nThe BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS, ) is a Chinese  satellite navigation  system. It consists of two separate satellite constellations \u2013 a limited test system that has been operating since 2000, and a full-scale global navigation system that is currently under construction.\nGalileo is the  global navigation satellite system  (GNSS) that is currently being created by the  European Union  (EU) through the  European Space Agency  (ESA) and the  European GNSS Agency  (GSA), headquartered in  Prague  in the  Czech Republic , with two ground operations centres,  Oberpfaffenhofen  near  Munich  in Germany and  Fucino  in Italy. The \u20ac5 billion project is named after the Italian astronomer  Galileo Galilei . One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an indigenous alternative high-precision positioning system upon which European nations can rely, independently from the Russian  GLONASS , Indian  NAVIC , Chinese  Bei Dou  and US  GPS  systems, in case they were disabled by their operators.The use of basic (low-precision) Galileo services will be free and open to everyone. The high-precision capabilities will be available for paying commercial users. Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre precision, and better positioning services at high  latitude s than other positioning systems.\nGNSS augmentation  is a method of improving a navigation system's attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability, through the integration of external information into the calculation process, for example, the  Wide Area Augmentation System , the  European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service , the  Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System ,  Differential GPS , and  inertial navigation system s.\nAugmentation of a  global navigation satellite system  (GNSS) is a method of improving the navigation system's attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability, through the integration of external information into the calculation process. There are many such systems in place and they are generally named or described based on how the GNSS sensor receives the external information. Some systems transmit additional information about sources of error (such as  clock drift ,  ephemeris , or  ionospheric delay ), others provide direct measurements of how much the signal was off in the past, while a third group provide additional vehicle information to be integrated in the calculation process.\nGLONASS (), also known as Uragan () ( GRAU  Index 11F654) are the first generation of Uragan satellite used as part of the  Russia n  GLONASS  radio-based  satellite navigation  system. Developed by  Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems , it had its debut launch in 1983, with the last launched unit on 2005 and the retirement of the last unit  Kosmos 2403  on April 30, 2009. It has been superseded by the  GLONASS-M  ( GRAU  Index 11F654M), the second-generation satellites.\nThe  Alpine Electronics  DVD-based navigation system was integrated with an 8-inch LCD display and a multi-use Interface Dial, which could move up, down, left and right like a mouse, turn like a knob, scroll through preset menus, and click when pushed to act as a selector button.  Unlike many in-car navigation systems, the Alpine DVD-based navigation unit allowed the driver to change destinations and routes \"on the fly\" while driving, rather than being locked out unless the car was in Park. The tightly integrated voice recognition system worked with the navigation system and could recognize spoken city and street names.  Also unique at the time was two-way communication via AcuraLink satellite communication. Using a facility of XM Radio service, the system could send a variety of messages to the car, including service appointment reminders (appointments first made via Internet) or important messages such as recall notices. The use of  OnStar  was carried over from the previous generation RL.  Use of digital/analog trimode (two digital bands and one analog band) technology allowed the 2005 RL OnStar technology to survive the planned 2007 phase-out of the analog OnStar to fully digital OnStar service.\nDuring the last 43 years SENER has supplied equipment, systems integration and engineering services to international markets in the fields of Space, Aeronautics and Vehicles and Defense.<br>In the Space field, the company develops components and systems for the flight segment in its three areas of activity: precision mechanisms, guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems and optical payloads.

Among its projects, we can mention the supply of  Taurus  missiles for the  Spanish Air Force  as main contractor or the participation in the  IRIS-T  and  Meteor   programs. SENER is also leading the project for the development of the future air defense system for the Spanish Army and Air Force, entitled Sagitario.\nIRNSS-1D is a satellite in the  Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS)  constellation. The satellite is the fourth of seven in the constellation, launched after  IRNSS-1A ,  IRNSS-1B  and  IRNSS-1C . The satellite is the only satellite in the constellation slated to provide navigational services to the region. The satellite will be placed in  geosynchronous orbit . It was launched successfully on 28 March 2015 onboard ISRO's  PSLV-C27  from  Satish Dhawan Space Center ,  Sriharikota .\nThe TRANSIT system, also known as NAVSAT or NNSS (for Navy Navigation Satellite System), was the first  satellite navigation system  to be used operationally. The system was primarily  used by the  U.S. Navy  to provide accurate location information to its  Polaris   ballistic missile submarine s, and it was also used as a navigation system by the Navy's  surface ship s, as well as for  hydrographic survey  and  geodetic surveying . Transit provided continuous navigation satellite service from 1964, initially for Polaris submarines and later for civilian use as well.\nA satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system (GNSS).  only the  United States  NAVSTAR  Global Positioning System  (GPS), the  Russia n  GLONASS  and the  EU s  Galileo  are global operational GNSSs.  China  is in the process of expanding its regional  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System  into the global  Compass navigation system  by 2020. The  European Union's   Galileo  is a global GNSS scheduled to be fully operational by 2020. India currently has  satellite-based augmentation system ,  GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation  (GAGAN), which enhances the accuracy of NAVSTAR GPS and GLONASS positions. India has already launched the  IRNSS , with an operational name NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), a constellation of satellites for navigation in and around the  Indian Subcontinent . It is expected to be fully operational by June 2016.  France  and  Japan  are in the process of developing regional navigation systems as well.\nReal Time Kinematic (RTK)  satellite navigation  is a technique used to enhance the precision of position data derived from satellite-based positioning systems (global navigation satellite systems,  GNSS ) such as  GPS ,  GLONASS ,  Galileo , and  BeiDou . It uses measurements of the  phase  of the signal's  carrier wave , rather than the information content of the signal, and relies on a single reference station or interpolated virtual station to provide real-time corrections, providing up to  centimetre -level  accuracy . With reference to GPS in particular, the system is commonly referred to as Carrier-Phase Enhancement, or CPGPS. It has application in  land survey  and in  hydrographic survey .\nThe School has strong research activity in wireless, ground-based and satellite-based positioning technology, being Australia\u2019s largest academic research concentration in these areas.  While the main research focus is  Global Navigation Satellite Systems  (GNSS) such as  GPS , the School also conducts research under the broad banner of \u2018 Navigation  and  Earth Observation \u2019 including in  surveying ,  geodesy ,  inertial navigation  systems,  pseudolites , mobilephone positioning, integrated navigation and imaging systems, and  radar   remote sensing .\nIn April 2007, the first satellite of BeiDou-2, namely Compass-M1 (to validate frequencies for the BeiDou-2 constellation) was successfully put into its working orbit. The second BeiDou-2 constellation satellite Compass-G2 was launched on 15 April 2009. On 15 January 2010, the official website of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System went online, and the system's third satellite (Compass-G1) was carried into its orbit by a  Long March 3C  rocket on 17 January 2010. On 2 June 2010, the fourth satellite was launched successfully into orbit. The fifth orbiter was launched into space from  Xichang Satellite Launch Center  by an  LM-3I  carrier rocket on 1 August 2010. Three months later, on 1 November 2010, the sixth satellite was sent into orbit by LM-3C. Another satellite, the Beidou-2/Compass IGSO-5 (fifth inclined geosynchonous orbit) satellite, was launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center by a Long March-3A on 1 December 2011 (UTC).\nThe two core satellite constellations are the  Global Positioning System  (GPS) of the US and the  Global Navigation Satellite System  (GLONASS) of Russia/India.  The third constellation will be the European Union  Galileo system  when it becomes fully operational.  These systems provide independent capabilities and can be used in combination with future core constellations and augmentation systems. Signals from core satellite are received by ground reference stations and any errors in the signals are identified.  Each station in the network relays the data to area-wide master stations where correction information for specific geographical areas is computed.  The correction message is prepared and uplinked to a  geostationary communication satellite  (GEO) via a ground uplink station. This message is broadcast to receivers on board aircraft flying within the broadcast coverage area of the system. The system is known in the US as WAAS ( Wide Area Augmentation System ), in Europe as EGNOS ( European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System ), in Japan as MSAS ( MTSAT Satellite Based Augmentation System ) and in India as GAGAN ( GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation ).\nThe Faculty of Geodesy and Land Management is one of the sixteen faculties of  University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn  and prepares students to work in the following fields:  digital photogrammetry and Internet photogrammetry, close range photogrammetry, engineering geodesy, satellite geodesy, higher geodesy, geomatics and spatial information systems, land management, numerical cartography, cadastral survey and common appraisal, mathematics and mathematical statistics, spatial and archeological reconstruction, positioning and navigation systems, remote sensing and photointerpretation, theory of deterministic chaos in dynamic analyses, theory of environment and real estate evaluation.  Students of  land management  are prepared to work in local governments in the fields of real estate management and turnover, spatial planning, property counselling and expertise. Research on application of global satellite navigation systems, improving methods of acquiring, gathering and processing geodetic and satellite data and their use in special information systems  as well as optimizing methods of space management are only a few examples of scientific fields of interest of the faculty employees.\nThe satellite will help augmenting the satellite based navigation system of India which is currently under development. The navigational system so developed will be a regional one targeted towards South Asia. The satellite will provide navigation, tracking and mapping services.\nIn addition to GPS, other systems are in use or under development, mainly because of a potential denial of access and potential monitoring by the US government.  The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System ( GLONASS ) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s. GLONASS can be added to GPS devices which makes more satellites available and enabling positions to be fixed more quickly and accurately, to within 2 meters  There are also the European Union  Galileo positioning system , China's  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System , the Japanese  Quasi-Zenith Satellite System , and India's  Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System  (NAVIC).\nSatellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows:\nThe first satellite navigation system,  Transit , used by the  United States Navy , was first successfully tested in 1960. It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour. In 1967, the U.S. Navy developed the  Timation  satellite that proved the ability to place accurate clocks in space, a technology required by the latter  Global Positioning System .  In the 1970s, the ground-based  Omega Navigation System , based on phase comparison of signal transmission from pairs of stations, became the first worldwide radio navigation system. Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\nLater in his career at NRL, Easton conceived, patented, and led the development of essential enabling technologies for the United States Global Positioning System (GPS). During the 1960s and early 1970s he developed a time-based navigational system with passive ranging, circular orbits, and space-borne high precision clocks placed in satellites. The idea was tested with four experimental satellites: TIMATION I and II (in 1967 and 1969) and Navigation Technology Satellites (NTS) 1 and 2 (in 1974 and 1977). NTS-2 was the first satellite to transmit GPS signals.\nThe NAVIC or NAVigation with Indian Constellation is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system developed by  Indian Space Research Organisation  (ISRO) which would be under the total control of  Indian government . The government approved the project in May 2006, with the intention of the system completed and implemented on 28 April 2016. It will consist of a constellation of 7 navigational satellites. 3 of the satellites will be placed in the  Geostationary orbit (GEO)  and the remaining 4 in the  Geosynchronous orbit(GSO)  to have a larger signal footprint and lower number of satellites to map the region. It is intended to provide an all-weather absolute position accuracy of better than 7.6 meters throughout  India  and within a region extending approximately 1,500 km around it. A goal of complete Indian control has been stated, with the  space segment ,  ground segment  and user receivers all being built in India. All seven satellites,  IRNSS-1A ,  IRNSS-1B ,  IRNSS-1C ,  IRNSS-1D ,  IRNSS-1E ,  IRNSS-1F , and  IRNSS-1G , of the proposed constellation were precisely launched on 1 July 2013, 4 April 2014, 16 October 2014, 28 March 2015, 20 January 2016, 10 March 2016 and 28 April 2016 respectively from  Satish Dhawan Space Centre . The system is expected to be fully operational by August 2016.\nYet another way to navigate a cruise missile is by using a  satellite positioning system , such as  GPS  or  GLONASS . Satellite navigation systems are precise and cheap. Unfortunately, they rely on satellites. If the satellites are interfered with (e.g. destroyed) or if the satellite signal is interfered with (e.g. jammed), the satellite navigation system becomes inoperable. Therefore, the GPS-based (or GLONASS-based) navigation is useful in a conflict with a technologically unsophisticated adversary. On the other hand, to be ready for a conflict with a technologically advanced adversary, one needs missiles equipped with TAINS and DSMAC.\nThe on-board  inertial navigation system  (INS) is fully integrated with the  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System , and provisions are made for future upgrades to include  Galileo (satellite navigation) / GPS / GLONASS  when expanded capabilities of these systems become available.  For potential export customers, it can select the  satellite navigation system s of its choice, though  GPS  is usually the norm.  In addition, despite the developer\u2019s claim that the navigational system of Z-10 can utilize a variety of satellite navigation to improve its accuracy, the integrated  GPS  corrected INS is the only system that has been shown to the public at Zhuhai Airshows and other defense exhibitions.  A modified  Blue Sky navigation pod  can also be carried by Z-10.  Information is shared via a secured data-link that provides real time and near-real time information.\nThe second application of space militarisation currently in use is GPS or  Global Positioning System .   This  satellite navigation system  is used for determining one's precise location and providing a highly accurate  time reference  almost anywhere on  Earth  or in  Earth orbit . It uses an  intermediate circular orbit  (ICO)  satellite constellation  of at least 24 satellites.  The GPS system was designed by and is controlled by the  United States Department of Defense  and can be used by anyone, free of charge. The cost of maintaining the system is approximately US$400 million per year, including the replacement of ageing satellites. The first of 24 satellites that form the current GPS constellation (Block II) was placed into orbit on February 14, 1989. The 52nd GPS satellite since the beginning in 1978 was launched November 6, 2004 aboard a  Delta II  rocket.The primary military purposes are to allow improved command and control of forces through improved location awareness, and to facilitate accurate targeting of  smart bombs ,  cruise missiles , or other munitions. The satellites also carry nuclear detonation detectors, which form a major portion of the  United States Nuclear Detonation Detection System .   Europe an concern about the level of control over the GPS network and commercial issues has resulted in the planned  Galileo positioning system . Russia already operates an independent system called  GLONASS  (global navigation system), the system operates with 24 satellites that are deployed in 3 orbital planes as opposed to the 4 GPS is deployed in.The Chinese \"Beidou\" system provides China a similar regional (not global) navigation capability. India is currently developing its own regional satellite navigation system, the  Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System .\nIRNSS-1A is the first navigational satellite in the  Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)  series of satellites been placed in  geosynchronous orbit .\nSince the 1960s, navigation has increasingly moved to  satellite navigation system s. These are essentially DME systems located in space. The fact that the satellites are in orbit and normally move with respect to the receiver means that the calculation of the position of the satellite needs to be taken into account as well, which can only be handled effectively with a computer.\nDepending on the job they have to do, we put satellites into different orbits. Some orbit the Sun, but most orbit the Earth. Three very useful types of orbit are a polar orbit, a geostationary orbit (GEO) and a low Earth orbit (LEO). These satellites are in orbit above the Earth's equator. They stay above the same location on Earth. They are used for telecommunications, television transmission and for navigation. Low Earth orbit (LEO) A satellite has a Low Earth Orbit when it orbits somewhere between 300 and 800 km above the Earth's surface. These satellites only take about 90 minutes to go around the Earth. They are ideal for making observations of the Earth's resources.\nSatellite navigation in the context of vehicle telematics is the technology of using a GPS and electronic mapping tool to enable the driver of a vehicle to locate a position, plan a route and navigate a journey.\nGLONASS, radio-based satellite navigation system operated for the Russian government by the Russian Space Forces. Make Enquiry. GLONASS, acronym for Globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema or Global Navigation Satellite System, is a radio-based satellite navigation system operated for the Russian government by the Russian Space Forces.\nA-GPS stands for Assisted Global Positioning System. While it works on the same principles as a GPS (explained below), the difference here is that it gets the information from the satellites by using network resources e.g. mobile network, also called assistant servers.-GPS and GPS are different navigational aids that both use information from satellites to determine their exact location on Earth. GPS stands for Global Positioning System. A GPS device communicates with 4 or more satellites to determine its exact location coordinates (latitude and longitude) anywhere on Earth.\nA satellite navigation or satnav system is a system of satellites that provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage.\nApps like HERE for Android are brilliant for finding your way around, but they couldn't work without GPS (Global Positioning System). What exactly is GPS though, and how does it actually work? When you're using HERE to navigate, the app needs to know where you are before it can offer guidance. It does this using GPS, a technology based on a series of satellites orbiting the earth some 12,000 miles up.\nGLONASS (Russian: \u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00bb\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081, IPA: [\u00c9\u00a1l\u00c9\u0090\u00cb\u0088nas]; \u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00bb\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00b1\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00bb\u00d1\u008c\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u008f \u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00b2\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u0086\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u008f \u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00bf\u00d1\u0083\u00d1\u0082\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00b2\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u008f \u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00b8\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0082\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bc\u00d0\u00b0; transliteration Globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema), or Global Navigation Satellite System, is a space-based satellite navigation system operating in the radionavigation-satellite service and used by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces.\nAt the top of the model range is the Accord EX V6 Sedan with leather interior. For the first time in an Accord model, a navigational system is available in EX sedans, the next-generation, voice activated Honda Satellite-Linked DVD Navigation System.\nAn acronym for Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (Global Navigation Satellite System), GLONASS is a Russian Aerospace Defense Force-operated satellite-based navigation system that is very much like GPS.\nThe first satellite navigation system, TRANSIT, used by the United States Navy, was first successfully tested in 1960. It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour.\nA satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few metres) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites.\nThe animation contains no audio. GPS-How It Works. Satellite Navigation is based on a global network of satellites that transmit radio signals in medium earth orbit. Users of Satellite Navigation are most familiar with the 32 Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites*. The United States, who developed and operates GPS, and Russia, who developed a similar system known as GLONASS, have offered free use of their respective systems to the international community.\n122 Fundamentals of GPS with advanced stable satellite technology have been instrumental for the development of global positioning system. The NAVSTAR GPS (Navigation System with Time and Ranging Global Positioning System) is a satellite based radio navigation system providing precise three- dimensional position, course and time information to suitably equipped user.\nThe global positioning system is a satellite-based navigation system consisting of a network of 24 orbiting satellites, eleven thousand nautical miles in space, in six different orbital paths. feedback\nThe global positioning system (GPS) is a network of satellites that orbit the earth and send a signal to GPS receivers and Navigation devices, giving them the precise location, speed, and if you are in an aircraft or up a mountain, altitude.he global positioning system (GPS) is a network of satellites that orbit the earth and send a signal to GPS receivers and Navigation devices, giving them the precise location, speed, and if you are in an aircraft or up a mountain, altitude.\nThe global positioning system (GPS) is a network of satellites that orbit the earth and send a signal to GPS receivers and Navigation devices, giving them the precise location, speed, and if you are in an aircraft or up a mountain, altitude.\nA GPS navigation device is a device that accurately calculates geographical location by receiving information from GPS satellites. Initially it was used by the United States military, but now most receivers are in automobiles and smartphones.The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system made up of a network of a minimum of 24, but currently 30, satellites placed into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defense.iven that High Sensitivity GPS receivers may be up to 30 dB more sensitive, this is sufficient to track through 3 layers of dry bricks, or up to 20 cm (8 inches) of steel reinforced concrete for example. Examples of high sensitivity receiver chips include SiRFstarIII and MediaTek \u00ca\u00bcs MTK II.\nMaking the world better, one answer at a time. GPS receivers is the third component of the GPS system. These range from navigation systems found on planes and in cars to hand held devices now available. A receiver uses signals received from three or more satellites to determine the position of the user.aking the world better, one answer at a time.
