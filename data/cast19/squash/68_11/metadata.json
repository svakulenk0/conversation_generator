{"input_text": "In her  Desert Island Discs  program, she said that her husband was her 'chief taster' because he had a British palate, so could tell her what she could expect her readers to feel. She mentioned that she never did any TV cooking series because she felt she came over as a cold person and expressed her view that whatever you do you shouldn't serve  bolognese  with  spaghetti  as it's just the wrong shape \u2013  tagliatelle  is much better.\nEmilia-Romagna's intensive farming economy in the northern region of Italy results in plentiful dairy and meat products, and their commonality in regional cooking \u2013 more so than the olive oil found in southern regions of Italy. Pastas from Emilia-Romagna and its capital, Bologna, are almost always served with a  rag\u00f9 , a thick sauce made from ingredients such as onions, carrots, finely ground pork and beef, celery, butter, and tomatoes.\nThe earliest documented recipe of an Italian meat-based sauce (rag\u00f9) served with pasta comes from late 18th century  Imola , near Bologna. A recipe for a meat sauce for pasta that is specifically described as being \"bolognese\" appeared in  Pellegrino Artusi 's cookbook of 1891. The rag\u00f9 alla bolognese that is now traditionally associated with tagliatelle and lasagne is somewhat different from Artusi's recipe. Many traditional variations currently exist. In 1982 the Italian Academy of Cuisine registered a recipe for authentic rag\u00f9 alla bolognese with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce (incorporating some fresh pancetta and a little milk). In Italy, rag\u00f9 alla bolognese is often referred to simply as rag\u00f9; and in Bologna, tagliatella.\nThe earliest documented recipe for a meat-based sauce ( rag\u00f9 ) served with pasta comes from late 18th century  Imola , near Bologna.  Pellegrino Artusi  published a recipe for a meat sauce characterized as being bolognese in his cookbook published in 1891. Artusi's recipe, which he called Maccheroni alla bolognese, is thought to derive from the mid 19th century when he spent considerable time in Bologna ( maccheroni  being a generic term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe only partially resembles the rag\u00f9 alla bolognese that is traditionally associated with tagliatelle. The sauce called for predominantly lean  veal  filet along with pancetta, butter, onion, and carrot. The meats and vegetables were to be finely minced, cooked with butter until the meats browned, then covered and cooked with broth. Artusi commented that the taste could be made even more pleasant by adding small pieces of dried mushroom, a few slices of  truffle , or chicken liver cooked with the meat and diced. As a final touch, he also suggested adding half a glass of cream to the sauce when it was completely done to make it taste even smoother. Artusi recommended serving this sauce with a medium size pasta (\"horse teeth\") made from durum wheat. The pasta was to be made fresh, cooked until it was  firm , and then flavored with the sauce and  Parmigiano cheese .\nIn the century-plus since Artusi recorded and subsequently published his recipe for Maccheroni alla bolognese, what is now rag\u00f9 alla bolognese has evolved with the cuisine of the region. Most notable is the preferred choice of pasta, which today is widely recognized as fresh  tagliatelle . Another reflection of the evolution of the cuisine over the past 150 years is the addition of tomato, either as a puree or as a concentrated paste, to the common mix of ingredients. Similarly, both wine and milk appear today in the list of ingredients in many of the contemporary recipes, and beef has mostly displaced veal as the dominant meat.\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's  prosciutto ,  culatello  and  Felino salami , Piacenza's  pancetta ,  coppa  and salami, Bologna's  mortadella  and  salame rosa , Modena's  zampone ,  cotechino  and  cappello del prete   and  Ferrara 's  salama da sugo .  Reggio Emilia  is famous for its fresh egg-made pasta  cappelletti  (similar to Bologna's tortellini but differing in size), the typical  erbazzone  a spinach and  Parmigiano Reggiano  salted cake and its  Gnocco Fritto  some kind of mixed flour stripes fried in boiling oil, enjoyed in combination with ham or salami.  Crescentina  best known as  tigella  is the typical thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena and it is usually filled in with the typical cunza (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include  zuppa inglese  (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and  Alchermes  liqueur) and  panpepato  (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include  Sangiovese  from Romagna,  Lambrusco  from  Reggio Emilia  or  Modena ,  Cagnina di Romagna ,  Gutturnio  and  Trebbiano  from  Piacenza .\nIn  Northern Italy  though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so. Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes; basil (found in  pesto ), nuts and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham ( prosciutto ), sausage ( cotechino ), different sorts of  salami , truffles,  grana ,  Parmigiano-Reggiano , and  tomato es ( Bolognese sauce  or  rag\u00f9 ).\nA common alternative to using potatoes in a gratin is the use of various kinds of  pasta , such as  penne ,  rigatoni ,  fusilli /spirelli, or  tagliatelle .\nSince tagliatelle are generally made as fresh pasta, the texture is porous and rough, making it ideal for thick sauces, generally made with beef, veal, or pork, and occasionally with rabbit, as well as several other less rich (and more vegetarian) options, such as briciole e noci (with breadcrumbs and  nut s), uovo e formaggio (with eggs and cheese\u2014a less rich  carbonara ), or simply pomodoro e basilico (with tomatoes and basil).\nThe recipes' common characteristics are the presence of meat and the fact that all are sauces for pasta. The most typical are rag\u00f9 alla  bolognese  ( Bolognese sauce ). Another types are rag\u00f9 alla  napoletana  ( Neapolitan rag\u00f9 ), and rag\u00f9 alla  Barese  (sometimes made with  horse meat ).\nGruppo Virtuale Cuochi Italiani (GVCI), an international organization and network of culinary professionals dedicated to authentic Italian cuisine, annually organizes and promotes an \"International Day of Italian Cuisines\" (IDIC). In 2010 tagliatelle al ragu alla bolognese was the official dish for IDIC. The event, held on 17 January 2010, included participation by 450 professional chefs in 50 countries who prepared the signature dish according to \"an authentic\" recipe provided by chef Mario Caramella. Media coverage was broad internationally, but reports often incorrectly identified the recipe followed as that of l'Accademia Italiana della Cucina, and some included stock photographs of spaghetti Bolognese.\nAll of the three are necessary  pasta  sauces among with other foreign pasta sauces. Salsa Carusso  was made specially for the opera singer  Enrico Caruso  at a time that he visited Uruguay and became a popular sauce (specially for its main dish 'cappeletis a la Carusso'), estofado is a stewed version of  ragu  made from  steak s and sometimes single eaten, tuco when it has chopped meat resembles a  bolognese sauce .\nThe traditional main course is  pasta , which includes regular pasta, pasta in broth and baked pasta, prepared in many different shapes. Almost all of pasta dishes require a base of \u201csfoglia\u201d, a dough of eggs and flour, handmade with a rolling pin. First courses include  cappelletti ,  passatelli  in broth,  lasagne ,  cannelloni , nidi di rondine,  ravioli ,  tagliatelle ,  garganelli ,  maltagliati ,  gnocchi  and  strozzapreti , seasoned with  bolognese sauce  or a  dressing  of  butter  and  sage .\nAfter the early 1830s, recipes for rag\u00f9 appear frequently in cookbooks from the Emilia-Romagna region. By the late 19th century, the use of heavy meat sauces on pasta was common on both  feast day s and Sundays with the wealthier classes (only, given the expense of meat and pasta) of the newly unified Italy.\nHowever, this would be inconsistent with the academy's own beliefs and statements about remaining faithful to tradition in documenting and preserving Italy's culinary heritage. Prominent Italian chef Mario Caramella stated, \"In Italy, there are several traditional recipes of tagliatelle al rag\u00f9 alla bolognese with more or less slight variations\". According to UK cookbook author and food writer  Felicity Cloake , \"The fact is that there is no definitive recipe for a bolognese meat sauce, but to be worthy of the name, it should respect the traditions of the area\", a view that is consistent with that often expressed by the Italian Academy of Cuisine.\nRag\u00f9 alla bolognese along with b\u00e9chamel is also used by many Italian chefs to prepare traditional baked  lasagna  in Bolognese style.\nBolognese sauce , known in  Italian  as rag\u00f9 alla bolognese , rag\u00f9 bolognese , or simply  rag\u00f9 , is a meat-based  sauce  originating from  Bologna , Italy, hence the name. In  Italian cuisine , it is customarily used to dress \" tagliatelle  al  rag\u00f9 \" and to prepare \" lasagne  alla bolognese\". In the absence of tagliatelle, it can also be used with other broad, flat pasta shapes, such as  pappardelle  or  fettuccine . Genuine rag\u00f9 alla bolognese is a slowly cooked sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including  sweating ,  saut\u00e9ing  and  braising . Ingredients include a characteristic  soffritto  of onion, celery and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped  beef , often alongside small amounts of fatty  lamb . Red wine and a small amount of  tomato concentrate  or tomatoes are added, and the dish is then gently  simmer ed at length to produce a thick sauce.\nNorthern Italy, mountainous in many parts, is notable for the alpine cheeses of the Valle d'Aosta, the  pesto  of Liguria, and, in Piedmonte, the Alba truffle. In the Alto Adige, the influence of neighboring Austria may be found in a regional repertoire that includes speck and dumplings. In the north,  risotto  and  polenta  have tended to serve the staple function taken by pasta across the rest of the country. Italy's center includes the celebrated culinary regions of Tuscany \u2014 famous for its olive oil and bean dishes \u2014 and Emilia-Romagna \u2014 home of  prosciutto di Parma ,  parmigiano-reggiano , and  rag\u00f9  \u2014 the latter now produced (and traduced) worldwide as spaghetti alla bolognese. Southern Italy includes the hearty food of Lazio in which meat and offal frequently figure, but also the vegetable-focused fare of Basilicata, historically one of Italy's poorest regions. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia have distinctively different foodways. The former is notable for its many sweet dishes, seafood, and citrus fruit, while Sardinian cuisine has traditionally looked to its hilly interior with a cuisine centered on lamb, sucking pig, breads, and  pecorino sardo . It is in the food of Naples and Campania, however, that many visitors would recognize the foods that have come to be regarded as quintessentially Italian:  pizza , spaghetti with  tomato sauce , aubergine  parmigiana  (but the origins of the two last dishes are claimed by Sicily).\nBologna is renowned for its culinary tradition. It has given its name to the well-known  Bolognese sauce , a meat based pasta sauce called in Italy  rag\u00f9  alla bolognese but in the city itself just rag\u00f9 as in  Tagliatelle  al rag\u00f9. Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured  pork  meats such as  prosciutto ,  mortadella  and  salumi  is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include  Pignoletto  dei Colli Bolognesi,  Lambrusco  di Modena and  Sangioves e di Romagna.  Tagliatelle  with  rag\u00f9 ,  lasagne ,  tortellini  served in broth, and mortadella, the original  Bologna sausage , are among the local specialties. Traditional Bolognese desserts are often linked to holidays, such as fave dei morti, multi-coloured almond paste cookies made for  All Saints' Day , jam-filled raviole cookies that are served on  Saint Joseph's Day , and carnival sweets known as sfrappole, a light and delicate fried pastry topped with powder sugar. Torta di riso, a custard-like cake made of almonds, rice and amaretto, is made throughout the year.\nEmilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regards to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour.  Bologna  is notable for pasta dishes like  tortellini ,  lasagne ,  gramigna  and  tagliatelle  which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations.  The  Romagna  subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like,  garganelli ,  strozzapreti ,  sfoglia lorda  and  tortelli alla lastra . In the  Emilia  subregion, except  Piacenza  which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of  Lombardy , rice is eaten to a lesser extent.  Polenta , a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated  balsamic vinegar  is made only in the Emilian cities of  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia , following legally binding traditional procedures.  Parmigiano Reggiano  (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while  Grana Padano  variety is produced in the rest of the region.\nLocal produce ranges from  salt-cured meat  ( prosciutto ,  salami ,  pancetta ,  capicola ,  lucanica  sausage etc.) and  cheese s, home-made pasta, such as  tortellini ,  tortelloni ,  lasagne ,  tagliatelle , local  truffles , wild  mushrooms  and sweet  chestnuts , etc. The influence of Tuscany is also strongly felt with game being prevalent in the autumn months as well as the Fiorentina steak, pappardelle and other pasta dishes.\nThe Neapolitan type is made from three main parts: a  soffritto ,  meat , and  tomato sauce . However, a major difference is how the meat is used, as well as the amount of tomato in the sauce. Bolognese versions use very finely chopped meat, while Neapolitan versions use whole meat, taking it from the  casserole  when cooked and serving it as a second course or with  pasta . Also, the Neapolitan soffritto contains much more  onion  compared to the Bolognese. Preferences for ingredients also differ. In Naples, white wine is replaced by  red wine ,  butter  by  lard  or  olive oil , and lots of  basil  leaves are used where Bolognese rag\u00f9 has no herbs. In the Neapolitan recipe, the content may well be enriched by adding  raisin s,  pine nut s, and  involtini  with different fillings.  Milk  or  cream  is not used, and a relative abundance of tomato sauce in flavour, in contrast to Bolognese use of a minimal amount, is preferred. The tomato season is, of course, much longer in more southern Naples than in more northern Bologna. Like the Bolognese, Neapolitan rag\u00f9 also has quite a wide range of variants, the best known of which is rag\u00f9 guardaporta (doorman's rag\u00f9).\nRicotta  tortelli, served with butter and herbs, is a popular dish in  Romagna . Other typical dishes include tortelli with  pumpkin  (common in  Mantua ,  Reggio Emilia ,  Piacenza , and  Cremona ) and tortelli di parma (from  Parma ), with ricotta and herbs, spinach, potatoes, or pumpkin.\nThe food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are its traditional  agnolotti  (pasta folded over with a roast beef meat and vegetable stuffing), Panissa (a typical dish of  Vercelli , a kind of  risotto  with  Arborio rice  or  Maratelli  rice, the typical kind of  Saluggia  beans, onion,  Barbera  wine, lard, salami, salt and pepper),  taglierini  (thinner version of tagliatelle),  bagna cauda  (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil and butter) and  bicerin  (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate and whole milk). Finally Piedmont is one of the Italian capitals of pastry and chocolate in particular, with products like  Nutella ,  gianduiotto  and  marron glac\u00e9  that are famous worldwide.\nThe recipe was called tagliolini di pasta e sugo, alla maniera di Zafiran (tagliolini of pasta and sauce in the manner of Zafiran) and it was served on silver plates. Over the years, tagliatelle has become considered a more common food.\nBologna  and  Modena  are notable for pasta dishes like  tortellini ,  lasagne ,  gramigna  and  tagliatelle  which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated  balsamic vinegar  is made only in the Emilian cities of  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia , following legally binding traditional procedures.  Parmigiano Reggiano  cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while  Grana Padano  variety is produced in Piacenza.\nIn Bologna rag\u00f9 alla bolognese is customarily paired and served with  tagliatelle , made with eggs and northern Italy\u2019s soft wheat flour. Acceptable alternatives to fresh tagliatelle include other broad flat pasta shapes, such as  pappardelle  or  fettuccine , and tube shapes, such as  rigatoni  and  penne . While the main complaint of traditionalists is against the use of spaghetti rather than fresh tagliatelle for the pasta, native Bolognese Piero Valdiserra has argued that \"spaghetti could be considered traditional in Bologna\", even though tagliatelle is the \"most suitable\" pasta.\nPasta is generally served with some type of sauce; the sauce and the type of pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs. In Northern Italy  white sauce  is more common. However Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in  Trentino-Alto Adige  and  Emilia Romagna . In Bologna, the meat-based  Bolognese sauce  incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called  pesto  originates from Genoa. In  Central Italy , there are sauces such as  tomato sauce ,  amatriciana ,  arrabbiata  and the egg-based  carbonara .Tomato sauces are also present in  Southern Italian  cuisine, where they originated. In Southern Italy more complex variations include pasta paired with fresh vegetables, olives, capers or seafood. Varieties include  puttanesca , pasta alla norma (tomatoes, eggplant and fresh or baked cheese),  pasta con le sarde  (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil), spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino (literally with garlic, [olive] oil and hot chili peppers).\nTagliatelle () and tagliolini (from the Italian tagliare, meaning \"to cut\") are a traditional type of  pasta  from  Emilia-Romagna  and  Marche , regions of  Italy . Individual pieces of tagliatelle are long, flat ribbons that are similar in shape to  fettuccine  and are typically about 6.5 mm to 10 mm (0.25 to 0.375 inch) wide. Tagliatelle can be served with a variety of  sauce s, though the classic is  Bolognese sauce . Tagliolini is another variety of tagliatelle that is long and cylindrical in shape, not long and flat.\nTortelli  is a type of  pasta  traditionally made in the  Lombardy ,  Emilia-Romagna , and  Tuscany  regions of  Italy . It can be found in several shapes, including square (similar to  ravioli ), semi-circular (similar to  anellini ), or twisted into a rounded, hat-like form (similar to cappelletti). It can be served with melted  butter ,  bolognese   sauce , broth, or other sauces. The same word is also used to describe small, fried  pastries  filled with jam or cream.\nThe most common variation of the sope involves simply adding chicken and is widely known as a sope de pollo. Sopes topped with beef are also a common variation and are typically slightly larger than sopes de pollo.\nIn Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham (prosciutto), sausage (cotechino), different sorts of salami, truffles, grana, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and tomatoes (Bolognese sauce or rag\u00c3\u00b9). Traditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In Tuscany pasta (especially pappardelle) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat).\nRagu alla Barese is prepared using horse meat; Ragu alla Napoletana has a lot of tomatoes and uses red wine; Ragu alla Bolognese uses white wine and less tomatoes. Ragu alla Bolognese or Bolognese sauce is the most popular version of ragu. Bolognese sauce originated in Bologna, Italy and dates back to the 15th century. It is a pasta sauce that is meat based and contains a small amount of tomato sauce.\n1.Ragu is a meat-based Italian sauce that is served with pasta while Bolognese sauce or Ragu alla Bolognese is a variation of ragu. 2.Ragu is thicker than other sauces, and while other variations of ragu such as Ragu alla Napoletana use red wine, Bolognese uses white wine. 3.Other ragu sauces use it for spaghetti pasta, but Bolognese uses it with wider-shaped pasta like lasagna because the thick sauce blends better with wider-shaped pasta. 4.Ragu and Bolognese taste better when cooked for as long as five to six hours.\nBolognese sauce is a red type of pasta sauce.
