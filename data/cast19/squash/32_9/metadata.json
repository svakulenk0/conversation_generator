{"input_text": "The longfin mako shark (Isurus paucus) is a  species  of  mackerel shark  in the family  Lamnidae , with a probable worldwide distribution in  temperate  and  tropical  waters. An uncommon species, it is typically lumped together under the name \" mako \" with its better-known relative, the  shortfin mako shark  (I. oxyrinchus). The longfin mako is a pelagic species found in moderately deep water, having been reported to a depth of . Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad  pectoral fin s of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the shortfin mako.\nThe biology of the longfin mako is little-known; it is somewhat common in the western Atlantic and possibly the central Pacific, while in the eastern Atlantic, it is rare and outnumbered over 1000-fold by the shortfin mako in fishery landings. The longfin mako's slender body and long, broad pectoral fins evoke the  oceanic whitetip shark  (Carcharhinus longimanus) and the  blue shark  (Prionace glauca), both slow-cruising sharks of upper oceanic waters. This  morphological  similarity suggests that the longfin mako is less active than the shortfin mako, one of the fastest and most energetic sharks. Like the other members of its family, this species possesses  blood vessel   countercurrent exchange  systems called the  rete mirabilia  (Latin for \"wonderful net\", singular rete mirabile) in its trunk musculature and around its eyes and brain. This system enables other mackerel sharks to conserve  metabolic heat  and maintain a higher body temperature than their environments, though whether the longfin mako is capable of the same is uncertain.\nThe most significant longfin mako catches are by Japanese tropical longline fisheries, and those sharks occasionally enter  Tokyo  markets. From 1987 to 1994, United States fisheries reported catches (discarded, as this species is worthless on the North American market) of 2\u201312 tons per year. Since 1999, retention of this species has been prohibited by the U.S.  National Marine Fisheries Service   Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic sharks. Longfin makos were once significant in the Cuban longline fishery, comprising a sixth of the shark landings from 1971 to 1972; more recent data from this fishery are not available. The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable due to its uncommonness, low reproductive rate, and susceptibility to shark fishing gear. It has also been listed under Annex I of the  Convention on Migratory Species   Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding . In the North Atlantic, stocks of the shortfin mako have declined 40% or more since the late 1980s, and concerns exist that populations of the longfin mako are following the same trend.\nIn the western  Atlantic , it can be found from  Argentina  and the  Gulf of Mexico  to  Browns Bank  off of  Nova Scotia . In Canadian waters, these sharks are neither abundant nor rare.  Swordfish  are good indicators of shortfin mako populations, as the former are a source of food and prefer similar environmental conditions.\nIsurus planus, also known as the Hook-tooth Mako or Hooked Mako, is an extinct  mako shark  that lived during the  Miocene  epoch from 23-5 million years ago. I. planus can only be found in marine deposits on the  Pacific rim , especially the west coast of the United States. Teeth belonging to I. planus can reach lengths of two inches, and are often found in  Bakersfield, California .\nThe most common marine fish in the Sound include  porgy , butterfish,  winter flounder ,  summer flounder ,  windowpane flounder ,  fourspot flounder , northern and striped  sea robin ,  little skate , menhaden, Atlantic silversides,  black seabass ,  blackfish  (tautog),  cunner ,  bluefish , and  smooth dogfish . Frequently  Atlantic bonito  and  false albacore , both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore.  Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing.  Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations.  Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous.  Anadromous fishes include  striped bass ,  white perch , alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory  shad .  Although several shark species likely infrequently wander in and out of the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area.  These are the  sand tiger shark , the  sandbar shark , the  spiny dogfish  and the  smooth dogfish .\nThe shortfin mako shark is a fairly large species of shark. An average adult specimen measures around  in length and weigh from . The species is  sexually dimorphic , with females typically larger than males. The largest shortfin mako shark taken on hook-and-line was , caught off the coast of California on June 3, 2013. Larger specimens are known, with a few large, mature females exceeding a length of  and a weight of . The longest verified length for a Shortfin Mako, caught off of the coast of  France  in September 1973, was . It can attain bursts of speed up to . A specimen caught off the coast of  Italy  and examined in an Italian fish market in 1881 was reported to weigh an extraordinary  at a length of . Growth rates appear to be somewhat accelerated in the shortfin mako in comparison to other species in the  lamnid  family.\nThe shortfin mako shark feeds mainly upon  cephalopods  and bony fish including  mackerel s,  tuna s,  bonito s, and  swordfish , but it may also eat other sharks,  porpoise s,  sea turtle s, and  seabirds . They hunt by lunging vertically up and tearing off chunks of their preys' flanks and fins. Makos swim below their prey, so they can see what is above and have a high probability of reaching prey before it notices. In Ganzirri and Isola Lipari,  Sicily , shortfin makos have been found with  amputated   swordfish  bills impaled into their head and gills, suggesting swordfish seriously injure and likely kill them. In addition, this location, and the late spring and early summer timing, corresponding to the swordfish's  spawning  cycle, suggests they hunt while the swordfish are most vulnerable, typical of many predators.\nBased on analyses of observer data collected from 2005 to 2009, 22 shark species were observed captured in the Marshall Islands longline tuna fishery, with 80% of the shark catch representing five species:  blue shark ( Prionace glauca ), silky shark ( Carcharhinus falciformis ), bigeye thresher shark ( Alopias superciliosus ), pelagic thresher shark (A. pelagicus) and oceanic whitetip shark ( Carcharhinus longimanus ) (Bromhead et al., 2012). Based on 2009 observer data, sharks and rays compose about 18% of total catch by weight by the Marshall Islands longline fishery.   Elasmobranch  species composition is 30% blue shark, 13% silky shark, 10% mako shark, 9% oceanic whitetip shark, and 37% other combined sharks and rays. Bromhead et al. (2012) found that in 2009, the most recent year of available observer data, the fishery had discontinued the use of fishing gear and methods known to be employed to target sharks (using large pieces of fish meat as bait, and placing baited hooks near the surface by attaching branchlines to floats), which had been employed in previous years of the study period (2005-2008).  In 2011 the Marshall Islands adopted a law that prohibits targeting sharks and prohibits the retention of sharks (see  shark sanctuary ).\nThe shortfin mako inhabits offshore  temperate  and  tropical  seas worldwide. The closely related longfin mako shark is found in the  Gulf Stream  or warmer offshore waters.\nDuring the three weeks following the policy's implementation, 66 sharks were caught. Almost 75 per cent of the sharks caught on drum lines were under the target three metre size. Of the 49 undersized sharks, nine were found dead on the hooks and 40 were released alive. Fisheries officers patrolling beaches in Perth and a contractor in the South-West killed 17 sharks longer than three metres. Figures released on 18 February by Fisheries Minister Ken Baston showed 95 per cent of sharks caught were tiger sharks \u2013 a total of 63 animals. According to the State Government's SharkSmart website, tiger sharks \"may only have been responsible for one shark bite in WA since 1980\". Two Mako sharks have also been found dead on the drum lines.\nShortfin mako sharks consume 3% of their weight each day and take about 1.5\u20132.0 days to digest an average-sized meal. By comparison, the  sandbar shark , an inactive species, consumes 0.6% of its weight a day and takes 3 to 4 days to digest it. An analysis of the stomach contents of 399 male and female mako sharks ranging from  suggest makos from  Cape Hatteras  to the  Grand Banks  prefer  bluefish , constituting 77.5% of their diet by volume. The average capacity of the stomach was 10% of the total weight. Shortfin mako sharks consumed 4.3% to 14.5% of the available bluefish between  Cape Hatteras  and  Georges Bank .\nThe school's mascot is a  mako shark  named  Isurus , after retiring a  pelican  named Pete.\nThe range of  tiger shark  (Galeocerdo cuvier),  oceanic whitetip shark  (Carcharhinus longimanus) and mako shark ( Isurus ) includes the ocean around Tuvalu. The mako is known as rokea in the  Tuvaluan  language.\nWidely scattered records suggest that the longfin mako shark has a worldwide distribution in tropical and warm-temperate oceans; the extent of its range is difficult to determine due to confusion with the shortfin mako. In the  Atlantic Ocean , it is known from the  Gulf Stream  off the  east coast of the United States ,  Cuba , and southern  Brazil  in the west, and from the  Iberian Peninsula  to  Ghana  in the east, possibly including the  Mediterranean Sea  and  Cape Verde . In the  Indian Ocean , it has been reported from the  Mozambique Channel . In the  Pacific Ocean , it occurs off  Japan  and  Taiwan , northeastern Australia, a number of islands in the Central Pacific northeast of  Micronesia , and southern  California .\nMako shark. Mako shark (genus Isurus), any of two species of swift, active, potentially dangerous sharks of the mackerel shark family, Isuridae. The shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) is found in all tropical and temperate seas, and the longfin mako (I. paucus) is scattered worldwide in tropical seas.\nExamples of shallow water sharks are the nurse, the hammerhead, the sandbar, the great white and the tiger shark. Pelagic sharks are shortfin makos and whale sharks. Deep water sharks, such as catsharks, goblin sharks and megamouth sharks, stay in cold water all year round.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\nSharks are related to skates and rays, and there are close to 400 species in the world. Along the Atlantic Coast, sharks generally migrate north in the spring and south in the fall. Sharks are related to skates and rays, and there are close to 400 species in the world.
