{"input_text": "A NoSQL (originally referring to \"non SQL\", \"non relational\" or \"not only SQL\") database provides a mechanism for  storage  and  retrieval  of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in  relational database s. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the \"NoSQL\" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century, triggered by the needs of  Web 2.0  companies such as  Facebook ,  Google , and  Amazon.com . NoSQL databases are increasingly used in  big data  and  real-time web  applications.   NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support  SQL -like query languages.\nThe key RTLinux design objective was to add hard real-time capabilities to a commodity operating system to facilitate the development of complex control programs with both capabilities. For example, one might want to develop a real-time motor controller that used a commodity database and exported a web operator interface. Instead of attempting to build a single operating system that could support real-time and non-real-time capabilities, RTLinux was designed to share a computing device between a real-time and non-real-time operating system so that (1) the real-time operating system could never be blocked from execution by the non-real-time operating system and (2) components running in the two different environments could easily share data. As the name implies RTLinux was originally designed to use Linux as the non-real-time system but it eventually evolved so that the RTCore real-time kernel could run with either Linux or  BSD UNIX .\nWhile early applications were based on echo planar imaging, which found an important application in Real-Time  functional MRI  (rt-fMRI), recent progress is based on  iterative reconstruction  and  FLASH MRI . The real-time imaging method proposed by Uecker and colleagues combines radial FLASH MRI, which offersrapid and continuous data acquisition, motion robustness, and tolerance to undersampling,with an  iterative image reconstruction  method based on the formulation of image reconstruction as a  nonlinear   inverse problem .By integrating the data from multiple receive coils (i.e. parallel MRI) and exploiting the  redundancy  in the time series of images with the use of  regularization  and  filtering , this approach enhances the possible degree of data undersampling by one order of magnitude, so that high-quality images may be obtained out of as little as 5 to 10% of the data required for a normal image reconstruction.\nReal-time Business Intelligence systems are  event driven , and may use  Complex Event Processing ,  Event Stream Processing  and  Mashup (web application hybrid)  techniques to enable events to be analysed without being first transformed and stored in a database. These  in-memory database  techniques have the advantage that high rates of events can be monitored, and since data does not have to be written into databases data latency can be reduced to milliseconds.\nIn  database   computing , Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) \u2014 an option for the  Oracle Database  software produced by  Oracle Corporation  and introduced in 2001 with  Oracle9i  \u2014 provides  software  for  clustering  and  high availability  in  Oracle database  environments. Oracle Corporation includes RAC with the Standard Edition, provided the nodes are clustered using  Oracle Clusterware .\nFirebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. The company provides client libraries that enable integration with  Android ,  iOS ,  JavaScript ,  Java ,  Objective-C ,  swift  and  Node.js  applications. The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several  JavaScript frameworks  such as  AngularJS ,  React ,  Ember.js  and  Backbone.js . The REST API uses the  Server-Sent Events  protocol, which is an API for creating HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. Developers using the realtime database can secure their data by using the company's server-side-enforced security rules.\nA characteristic of modern database applications is that they facilitate simultaneous updates and queries from multiple users. Systems in the 1970s might have accomplished this by having each user in front of a  3270  terminal to a  mainframe computer . By the mid-1980s it was becoming more common to give each user a  personal computer  and have a program running on that PC that connected to a database  server . Information would be pulled from the database, transmitted over a network, and then arranged, graphed, or otherwise formatted by the program running on the PC. Starting in the mid-1990s it became more common to build database applications with a Web interface. Rather than develop custom software to run on a user's PC, the user would use the same Web browser program for every application. A database application with a Web interface had the advantage that it could be used on devices of different sizes, with different hardware, and with different operating systems. Examples of early database applications with Web interfaces include  amazon.com , which used the  Oracle relational database management system , the photo.net online community, whose implementation on top of  Oracle  was described in the book Database-Backed Web Sites (Ziff-Davis Press; May 1997), and  eBay , also running Oracle.\nAlthough technically predating the application, one important step in the development of what would become Radio 3 did take place in 1997, when Nightlines and RealTime were merged into the new program  RadioSonic , cohosted by former Nightlines host  David Wisdom  and former RealTime host  Leora Kornfeld .\nForeign keys play an essential role in  database design .  One important part of database design is making sure that relationships between real-world entities are reflected in the database by references, using foreign keys to refer from one table to another.Another important part of database design is  database normalization , in which tables are broken apart and foreign keys make it possible for them to be reconstructed.\nChannel applications are very important to banks. Bank channel applications enable nearly all the customer interactions. BTT provides a common framework for building integrated and consistent channel applications in multiple channels. Channel applications are built on a common framework, leveraging new capabilities across all channels: Home Banking, Teller, ATM, Contact Center, and Mobile Banking.\nBecause these applications are designed to fulfil specific operation time requirements, their marketing materials often indicate that these are real-time database systems. However, since such performance measurements are often executed for atomic operations (especially write operations), not necessarily whole transactions, not all of the operational historians must be in fact real-time databases.\nAmong the important recent projects created in World Map is TweetMap, developed in a collaboration between Todd Mostak and the Center for Geographic Analysis. This project supports  Twitter  storage, query, analysis, display, and download of massive  Twitter  geo-spatial data sets consisting of  billions  of features.  The underlying platform, called MapD, works by parallelizing processes across commodity  GPU  cards, achieving speedups over traditional databases by a factor of a million using inexpensive hardware. Among other applications, TweetMap can be used for tracking earthquakes and epidemics such as influenza in real time.\nA \"generalization\" of Bell Labs' time-sharing operating system  Unix ,MERT featured a redesigned, modular  kernel  that was able to run Unix programs as well as privileged real-time processes. These processes' data structures were isolated from other processes with  message passing  being the preferred form of  interprocess communication  (IPC), although  shared memory  was also implemented. MERT also sported a custom filesystem with special support for large, contiguous, statically sized files, as used in real-time  database  applications. The design of MERT was influenced by Dijkstra's  THE , Hansen's  Monitor  and IBM's  CP-67 .\nIn-database processing makes data analysis more accessible and relevant for high-throughput, real-time applications including fraud detection, credit scoring, risk management, transaction processing, pricing and margin analysis, usage-based micro-segmenting, behavioral ad targeting and recommendation engines, such as those used by customer service organizations to determine next-best actions.\nBecause NI combines real-time  network monitoring  with IP metadata extraction, it enhances the effectiveness of applications for  Database Security ,  Database Auditing  and Network Protection. The network visibility afforded by NI can also be used to build enhancements and next-generation solutions for  Network Performance Management ,  WAN Optimization ,  Customer Experience Management ,  Content Filtering , and internal billing of networked applications.\nStarcounter can be likened by  Oracle 's  TimesTen  in-memory database and  SAP HANA . What these have in common is that they are all based on in-memory technology and are often targeted towards customers that use real-time applications. The main difference is the way the  database management system  is integrated. SAP HANA makes use of a  column-oriented database management system . TimesTen, on the other hand, uses a  relational database management system  (RDBMS). Starcounter is unique in that it uses an object-oriented approach that is integrated with the application (VMDBMS) with an underlying RDMBS .\nRaima Database Manager (or RDM) is an  ACID -compliant  embedded database  management system designed for use in  embedded systems  applications.  RDM has been designed to utilize multi-core computers, networking (local or wide area), and on-disk or  in-memory  storage management. RDM provides support for multiple  application programming interfaces  (APIs): low-level C API, C++, and  SQL (native,  ODBC ,  JDBC ,  ADO.NET , and  LabView ). RDM is highly portable and is available on  Windows ,  Linux ,  Unix  and several real-time or  embedded operating systems . A source-code license is also available.\nIn  computer science , in-memory processing is a developing technology for  processing of data  stored in an  in-memory database . Older systems have been based on  disk storage  and  relational database s using  SQL  query language, but these are increasingly regarded as inadequate to meet  business intelligence  (BI) needs. Because stored data is accessed much more quickly when it is placed in  Random Access Memory  (RAM) or  flash memory , in-memory processing allows data to be analysed in  real time , enabling faster reporting and decision-making in business.\nThe Series/1 was also widely used in manufacturing environments, including  General Motors  assembly plants.   Example systems and applications included Manufacturing Information Database (MIDB), Vehicle Component Verification System (VCVS) and  Assembly Line Diagnostic Link  (ALDL). These systems were connected to plant floor devices and used in the realtime manufacture of vehicles. There was also a Time and Attendance (T&A) system connected to badge readers and employee turnstiles. Series/1 computers where also utilized in the early development of GM's  Manufacturing Automation Protocol  (MAP)\nA real-time database is a database system which uses  real-time processing  to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing. This differs from traditional databases containing persistent data, mostly unaffected by time. For example, a stock market changes very rapidly and is dynamic. The graphs of the different markets appear to be very unstable and yet a database has to keep track of current values for all of the markets of  the New York Stock Exchange . Real-time processing means that a transaction is processed fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away. Real-time databases are useful for accounting, banking, law,  medical record s,  multi-media , process control, reservation systems, and scientific data analysis.\nIn  computer science , event monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and  signaling  event occurrences to subscribers such as  operating system   processes , active  database  rules as well as human operators. These event occurrences may stem from arbitrary sources in both  software  or  hardware  such as operating systems,  database management system s,  application software  and  processor s. Event monitoring may use a  time series database .\nAlthough applications of real-time MRI cover a broad spectrum ranging from non-medical studies of  turbulent flow   to the noninvasive monitoring of interventional (surgical) procedures, the most important application making use of the new capabilities is  cardiovascular  imaging. With the new method it is possible to obtain movies of the beating heart in real time with up to 50 frames per second during free breathing andwithout the need for a synchronization to the  electrocardiogram .\nThe LiVES application allows the user to manipulate video in realtime and in non-realtime. The application also has features which go beyond traditional video editing applications - for example, it can be controlled and monitored remotely over a network, and it has facilities for streaming to and from another copy of LiVES. It is  resolution  and  frame rate  independent.\nOperational database management systems (also referred to as  OLTP  On Line Transaction Processing databases), are used to manage dynamic data in real-time. These types of databases allow you to do more than simply view archived data. Operational databases allow you to modify that data (add, change or delete data), doing it in  real-time .\nVoice and video traffic is generally transmitted using UDP. Real-time video and audio streaming protocols are designed to handle occasional lost packets, so only slight degradation in quality occurs, rather than large delays if lost packets were retransmitted. Because both TCP and UDP run over the same network, many businesses are finding that a recent increase in UDP traffic from these real-time applications is hindering the performance of applications using TCP, such as  point of sale ,  accounting , and  database  systems. When TCP detects packet loss, it will throttle back its data rate usage. Since both real-time and business applications are important to businesses, developing  quality of service  solutions is seen as crucial by some.\nObjectStore was originally created in 1988 by  Object Design, Incorporated , which was based in  Burlington, Massachusetts  and founded by several former Symbolics employees, including  Daniel Weinreb . In 2002 the product was acquired by  Progress Software , which continued to develop the technology, expanding its use beyond the object database market to target uses as a database for  real-time computing , specifically designed for  RFID  data management, and as a  cache  for relational databases.\nAerospike is the company behind the Aerospike open source  NoSQL  distributed  database  which has a horizontally scalable high-speed lightweight data layer. Citrusleaf, a Mountain View, California based company which  rebranded  to Aerospike in August 2012, launched the database in 2011. The company purpose-built the database for  developers  to deploy real-time big data applications.\nSQLstream provides a relational stream processing platform called SQLstream Blaze for analyzing large volumes of service, sensor and machine and log file data in real-time. It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data.  Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard  SQL language , using the  ANSI  standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional  RDBMS  SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries do not exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored.  Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement.  For example, partitioning by a customer id would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer.  This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution.   SQLstream Blaze also allows changes to be made to the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications.  This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application.  Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules.  In this way, it provides an effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data.  SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally.  Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases.  SQLstream is able to execute its queries in an optimized C++ multi-threaded dataflow engine which operates lock-free.  This enables people to create lock-free parallel processing applications easily, which otherwise require specialist skillets and are often difficult to get working and are often error prone.\nThe FKF method extends the very high accuracies of Satellite Geodesy to Virtual Reference Station (VRS)  Real Time Kinematic  (RTK) surveying, mobile positioning and ultra-reliable navigation (Lange, 2003). First important applications will be real-time optimum calibration of global observing systems in Meteorology, Geophysics, Astronomy etc.\nLater editions targeted the high performance non-embedded software market, including capital markets applications ( algorithmic trading ,  order matching  engines) and real-time caching for Web-based applications, including social networks and e-commerce. Features added to support this focus include a  SQL   ODBC  and  JDBC  interfaces,  64-bit  support, and  multiversion concurrency control  (MVCC) transaction management.\nTraditional databases are persistent but are incapable of dealing with dynamic data that constantly changes. Therefore, another system is needed. Real-time databases may be modified to improve accuracy and efficiency and to avoid conflict, by providing deadlines and wait periods to insure temporal consistency. Real-time database systems offer a way of monitoring a physical system and representing it in data streams to a database. A data stream, like memory, fades over time. In order to guarantee that the freshest and most accurate information is recorded there are a number of ways of checking transactions to make sure they are executed in the proper order. An online auction house provides an example of a rapidly changing database.\nEmpress Software, Inc., developer of the Empress Embedded Database, is a privately held company founded in 1979. Empress Embedded Database is a full-function, relational database that has been embedded into applications by organizations small to large, with deployment environments including medical systems, network routers, nuclear power plant monitors, satellite management systems, and other embedded system applications that require reliability and power. Empress is an  ACID  compliant,  SQL  database engine with C,  C++ , Java,  JDBC , ODBC,  SQL ,  ADO.NET  and kernel level  API s. Applications developed using these APIs may be run in standalone and/or server modes.  Empress Embedded Database runs on Linux,  Unix , Microsoft Windows and  real-time operating system s.\nA series of Bhuvan Application Services that are diversified and relevant for many ministries were released on August 12,2015 .

The tool \u201cBhuvan Ganga\u201d now available on  public domain  for people to participate in providing vital information for Clean Ganga project.\nClusterpoint database enables to perform  transactions  in a distributed document database model in the same way as in a  SQL  database.  Users can perform secure real-time updates, free text search, analytical SQL querying and reporting at high velocity in  very large distributed databases  containing XML or JSON document type data.  Transactions  are implemented without database consistency issues plaguing most of  NoSQL  databases and can safely run at high-performance speed previously available only with  relational databases .  Real time   Big data  analytics, replication, loadsharing and high-availability are standard features of Clusterpoint database software platform.\nLinux/RK consists of two major components, the  Linux kernel  and a subsystem called the Portable Resource Kernel. A resource kernel provides timely, guaranteed and enforced access to physical resources for  applications . A main function of an operating system kernel is to multiplex available system resources across multiple requests from several applications. The traditional non-realtime kernel allocates a time-multiplexed resource to an application based on fairness metrics during a certain period. With a resource kernel, an application can request the reservation of a certain amount of a resource, and the kernel can guarantee that the requested amount is available to the application. Such a guarantee of resource allocation gives an application the knowledge of the amount of its currently available resources. A  QoS  manager or an application itself can then optimize the system behavior by computing the best QoS obtained from the available resources.\nOne of the major application areas of urban computing is to improve private and public transportation in a city. The primary sources of data are floating car data (data about where cars are at a given moment). This includes individual GPS\u2019s, taxi GPS\u2019s, WiFI signals, loop sensors, and (for some applications) user input.Urban computing can help select better driving routes, which is important for applications like Waze, Google Maps, and trip planning. Wang et al. built a system to get real-time travel time estimates. They solve the problems: one, not all road segments will have data from GPS in the last 30 minutes or ever; two, some paths will be covered by several car records, and it\u2019s necessary to combine those records to create the most accurate estimate of travel time; and three, a city can have tens of thousands of road segments and an infinite amount of paths to be queried, so providing an instantaneous real time estimate must be scalable. They used various techniques and tested it out on 32670 taxis over two months in Beijing, and accurately estimated travel time to within 25 seconds of error per kilometer.\nReal-time databases are traditional databases that use an extension to give the additional power to yield reliable responses. They use timing constraints that represent a certain range of values for which the data are valid. This range is called temporal validity. A conventional database cannot work under these circumstances because the inconsistencies between the real world objects and the data that represents them are too severe for simple modifications. An effective system needs to be able to handle time-sensitive queries, return only temporally valid data, and support priority scheduling. To enter the data in the records, often a sensor or an input device monitors the state of the physical system and updates the database with new information to reflect the physical system more accurately. When designing a real-time  database system , one should consider how to represent valid time, how facts are associated with  real-time system . Also, consider how to represent attribute values in the database so that process transactions and data consistency have no violations.\nDatabase application deployments that do not include an Oracle database which want to use TimesTen as an in-memory cache database can use XLA to capture updates made to the TimesTen database and, via custom application code, apply these updates to their backend database. They can also utilize a real-time data integration tool like Oracle GoldenGate to replicate changes from their backend database into TimesTen.\nThe amount of research studying real-time database systems will increase because of commercial applications such as web based auction houses like e-bay. More developing countries are expanding their phone systems, and the number of people with cell phones in the United States as well as other places in the world continues to grow. Also likely to spur real-time research is the exponentially increasing speed of the microprocessor. This also enables new technologies such as web-video conferencing and instant messenger conversations in sound and high-resolution video, which are reliant on real-time database systems. Studies of temporal consistency result in new protocols and timing constraints with the goal of handling real-time transactions more effectively.\nFirebase is a cloud services provider and backend as a service company based in San Francisco, California. The company makes a number of products for software developers building mobile or web applications. Firebase was founded in 2011 by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin and launched with a realtime cloud database in April 2012.\nMicroservice applications put a lot of emphasis on real-time monitoring of the application, checking both architectural elements (how many requests per second is the database getting) and business relevant metrics (such as how many orders per minute are received).\nAn application context is a set of name-value pairs that Oracle Database stores in memory. The application context has a label called a namespace, for example, empno_ctx for an application context that retrieves employee IDs.\nSAP applications, built around their latest R/3 (The R was for Realtime data processing) system, provide the capability to manage financial, asset, and cost accounting, production operations and materials, personnel, plants, and archived documents.\nSometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as more flexible than relational database tables. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called Not only SQL to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages. Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of the CAP theorem) in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed.\nFirebase is a cloud services provider and backend as a service company based in San Francisco, California.
