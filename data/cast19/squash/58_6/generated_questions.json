The IoT Gateway, provides a communication link between the field and the Cloud and can also offer local processing and storage capabilities to provide offline services and if required real time control over the devices in the field. To achieve sustainable interoperability in the  Internet of Things  ecosystem today there are two dominant architectures for data exchange protocols: bus-based ( DDS,  REST,  XMPP ) and broker based ( AMPQ,  CoAP,  MQTT,  JMI ). The protocols that support the information exchange between interoperability domains can also be classified to message-centric (AMQP, MQTT,  JMS, REST) and data-centric (DDS, CoAP, XMPP).  To use the full potential of IoT the interconnected devices communicate using lightweight protocols that don\u2019t require extensive CPU resources. C, Java, Python and some scripting languages are the preferable choices used by IoT applications.
