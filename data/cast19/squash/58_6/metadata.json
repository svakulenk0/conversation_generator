{"input_text": ", Exadata was available in the  Oracle Cloud  as a subscription service, also known simply as the \"Exadata Service\". Databases deployed in this service include all the features and options of Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.  Similarly, all Exadata features and capabilities are included in this service. Oracle databases in the Exadata Service are 100% compatible with databases deployed on-premises, which enables customers to transition to the Cloud with no application changes. Oracle Corporation manages this service \u2013 including hardware, network, Linux software and Exadata software \u2013, while customers have complete ownership of their databases.\nPlatform as a service (PaaS) is a category of  cloud computing services  that provides a  platform  allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. PaaS can be delivered in two ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks,  servers ,  storage ,  OS , 'middleware' (i.e.; java runtime, .net runtime, integration, etc.),  database  and other services to host the consumer's application; or as a private service (software or  appliance ) inside the firewall, or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.\niland provides cloud-based  disaster recovery  and  business continuity  services. Its solution, the iland Continuity Cloud, includes  data replication  targets for enterprise data, and standby resources that can be activated during disasters to restore data, application, and business services. Other services include the iland Workforce Cloud that integrates  desktop virtualization  with a company's overall  business continuity  and  disaster recovery  plan, the iland SaaS Cloud that provides a cloud environment specifically for software as a services (SaaS) providers, and the iland Hybrid Cloud that merges virtual cloud and physical  colocated servers  for custom enterprise configurations.  The iland Enterprise Cloud provides a cloud environment for production business systems and iland Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) provides a data replication service for  Dell   EqualLogic  customers to the iland cloud environment.\nSeveral other vendors provide cloud database services similar to Amazon RDS.  Oracle  offers Oracle Cloud, a database service supporting Oracle's database technology.  Microsoft  offers  Windows Azure  SQL, a service supporting the Microsoft SQL database. Competitors supporting  MySQL  include  RackSpace  Cloud Databases ,   Google Cloud  SQL,  HP Cloud  for MySQL,  Xeround Cloud Database , and ClearDB.\nEnterpriseDB offers two editions of a cloud database. These are the EDB Postgres Plus Cloud Database Advanced, which includes the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database, and EDB Postgres Plus Cloud Database Basic, which includes the PostgreSQL database. The Management Console in the cloud products provision databases in single instances, high availability clusters, or development sandboxes for Database-as-a-Service environments.\nThe server cloud has been historically enterprise-based deployed by businesses needing an in-house cloud. However, there are also in-house options available for individual users such as the open-source  ownCloud  (which runs on Linux), the  CloudLocker  device by StoAmigo and the Nimbus project.\nAn IoT Gateway provides the means to bridge the gap between devices in the field (factory floor, home, etc.), the Cloud, where data is collected, stored and manipulated by enterprise applications, and the user equipment (smart phones, tablets etc.). The IoT Gateway, provides a communication link between the field and the Cloud and can also offer local processing and storage capabilities to provide offline services and if required real time control over the devices in the field. To achieve sustainable interoperability in the  Internet of Things  ecosystem today there are two dominant architectures for data exchange protocols: bus-based ( DDS ,  REST ,  XMPP ) and broker based ( AMPQ ,  CoAP ,  MQTT ,  JMI ). The protocols that support the information exchange between interoperability domains can also be classified to message-centric (AMQP, MQTT,  JMS , REST) and data-centric (DDS, CoAP, XMPP).  To use the full potential of IoT the interconnected devices communicate using lightweight protocols that don\u2019t require extensive CPU resources. C, Java, Python and some scripting languages are the preferable choices used by IoT applications. To handle any needed protocol conversion, database storage or decision making (e.g. collision handling), IoT nodes use separate IoT gateways in order to supplement the low-intelligence within the IoT node.\nFor startups and SMBs, tracking inventory in real time is very important. Not only can business owners track and collect data but also generate reports. At the same time, entrepreneurs can access cloud-based inventory data from a wide range of internet enabled devices, including: smartphones, tablets, laptops, as well as traditional desktop PCs. In addition, users do not have to be inside business premises to use web based inventory program and can access the inventory software while on the road.\nIQLECT's primary offering is a cloud-based hardware-software converged service platform for real-time data analysis.

The plugin framework allows for application-specific backups and is used by Amanda Enterprise to support applications such as  Oracle database , Samba  network share , NDMP, etc. Amanda Enterprise also supports image-level backup of live  VMs  running on VMware infrastructure.\nPaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a  computing platform , typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS offers like  Microsoft Azure  and  Google App Engine , the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually. The latter has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real-time in cloud environments. Even more specific application types can be provided via PaaS, such as media encoding as provided by services like bitcodin.com or media.io.\nIn June 2015 Jelastic released version 3.3, code name \"Trinity\" to represent the union of three cloud options (Hybrid, Public and Private), with multi-region support within different data centers and clouds.\nSolutions to privacy in cloud computing include policy and legislation as well as end users' choices for how data is stored. The cloud service provider needs to establish clear and relevant policies that describe how the data of each cloud user will be accessed and used.  Cloud service users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access. Cryptographic encryption mechanisms are certainly the best options. In addition, authentication and integrity protection mechanisms ensure that data only goes where the customer wants it to go and it is not modified in transit.\nThe control panel includes management interfaces for the Cloud Sites, Cloud Servers and Cloud Files services. There was once a web based file manager, but this was removed for undisclosed reasons. It also allows users to manage multiple clients and the plans and products (e.g. databases, 24x7 support) that apply to them, with white label branding options for messaging. The clients themselves have access to a restricted version of the control panel that allows them to conduct administrative tasks such as managing mail accounts.\nCloud Tools are applications and infrastructure software built to run on the RackSpace cloud. Applications listed include  Zend , a PHP stack,  Cloudkick , a cloud performance testing services,  CopperEgg , a real-time cloud server and application monitoring service,  Xeround , a MySQL cloud database, and  MongoLab , the cloud version of the popular  NoSQL  database  MongoDB .\nAfter registering to use the site, users can create a database, set up  field types , add  records ,  link tables ,  collaborate  with a team, sort the records based on a field and publish views to external websites. When an Airtable database is created, it is automatically hosted to the  cloud . The values in the fields are updated real time.\nDatabase management tools include support for  MySQL ,  SQL Server ,  DB2 ,  Sybase , and  Oracle . The company's well-known TOAD product is also now available for  cloud  and  NoSQL  databases.\nThese days XAP is used for  complex event processing  and  real-time business intelligence  for big data.  With XAP you can replicate data to a  Relational database  or non-relational NoSQL database, enabling data replication across remote sites over  WAN , for  Disaster recovery , and is also cloud-ready.\nCipherCloud's platform serves as a gateway that encrypts data in realtime before sending the data into a cloud environment via Searchable Strong Encryption (SSE) which has been validated by FIPS 140-2. The data is only decrypted when an authorized user retrieves data from the cloud and the data is returned. Encryption keys are stored locally, never leave the user\u2019s site and are not shared with the cloud provider. The platform is also capable of using  tokenization , which is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent. It also offers  data loss  and  malware  detection and monitoring for cloud environments.\nCloudBoost is a  cloud services provider  and  backend as a service  company based in  Hyderabad, India . The company makes a number of products for  software developer s building mobile or web applications.

Complex administration processes like patching the database software, backing up databases and enabling  point-in-time recovery  are managed automatically. Scaling storage and compute resources can be performed by a single  API  call.\nIn early 2008,  Eucalyptus  became the first open-source, AWS API-compatible platform for deploying private clouds. In early 2008,  OpenNebula , enhanced in the RESERVOIR European Commission-funded project, became the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds, and for the federation of clouds. In the same year, efforts were focused on providing  quality of service  guarantees (as required by real-time interactive applications) to cloud-based infrastructures, in the framework of the IRMOS European Commission-funded project, resulting to a  real-time cloud environment . By mid-2008, Gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing \"to shape the relationship among consumers of IT services, those who use IT services and those who sell them\" and observed that \"organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models\" so that the \"projected shift to computing... will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas.\"\nFirebase is a cloud services provider and backend as a service company based in San Francisco, California. The company makes a number of products for software developers building mobile or web applications. Firebase was founded in 2011 by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin and launched with a realtime cloud database in April 2012.\nWhile cloud storage sounds like it has something to do with weather fronts and storm systems, it really refers to saving data to an off-site storage system maintained by a third party. Instead of storing information to your computer's hard drive or other local storage device, you save it to a remote database. The Internet provides the connection between your computer and the database. On the surface, cloud storage has several advantages over traditional data storage. For example, if you store your data on a cloud storage system, you'll be able to get to that data from any location that has Internet access. You wouldn't need to carry around a physical storage device or use the same computer to save and retrieve your information.\nWhatever it does, this cloud service is certainly part of the application platform\u00e2\u0080\u0094it provides a service that the application relies on while it executes. From the point of view of the developer, services in the cloud just provide more options to use when designing and building an application. Just about every application today relies on other software: operating systems, database management software, even software running in the public cloud. Whatever it does and wherever it runs, all of this software together comprises an application platform.\nSelect the most appropriate option from those listed below to obtain a workspace: 1  apex.oracle.com - Request a workspace on our free 'development only' service for evaluating the technology.
