The ACL is very small, smaller than some might think; the average length is 38mm and only 11mm wide. The knee is formed by the connection of the femur (upper leg bone) and the Tibia (lower leg bone) with another two bones been the fibula (small bone next to the tibia) and the patella (the knee cap). Within these two main bones tendons attach the bones to the muscles that give the knee movement, while the ligaments provide the knee with stability.  The ACL looks like a mixture of an oval and triangle shape, and is located in a very compact area within the knee. The ACL fibers are in place to give direction for the knee to move, such as a kicking or twisting motion. If an ACL rupture occurs, it immediately forces an increase for not only the anterior tibial translation but also the internal tibial rotation as the femur is pushed back to rotate, this creates trauma to the knee as it is not stabilised. The ACL is there to create rotational stability within the knee to be able to produce different motions.

Most ACL tears are a result of landing or planting in cutting or pivoting sports, with or without contact. Most serious athletes will require an ACL reconstruction if they have a complete tear and want to return to sports, because the ACL is crucial for stabilizing the knee when turning or planting. Reconstruction is most commonly done by autograft, meaning the tissue used for the repair is from the patient\u2019s body. Other times, a cadaver is used for tissue.

In the event of an allograft, in which material is donated, this is not necessary. The surgeon will make holes in the patient\u2019s bones to run the tissue through, and the tissue serves as the patient\u2019s new ACL. Recovery time ranges between one and two years or longer. A week or so after the occurrence of the injury, the athlete is usually deceived by the fact that he/she is walking normally and not feeling much pain.

Your ACL can be injured if your knee joint is bent backward, twisted, or bent side to side.The chance of injury is higher if more than one of these movements occurs at the same time. Contact (being hit by another person or object) also can cause an ACL injury. An ACL injury often occurs during sports.njuries range from mild, such as a small tear, to severe, such as when the ligament tears completely or when the ligament and part of the bone separate from the rest of the bone.
