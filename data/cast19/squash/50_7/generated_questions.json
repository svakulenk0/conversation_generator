the United States and Japan met at a symposium held in Hawaii. It was the first \"University Space Systems Symposium\". Here,  Bob Twiggs, professor emeritus at the  Stanford University, proposed the initial idea of what later would become the nanosatellite projects. That idea was to launch a structure of the size of a soda can into space. Its volume should be around 350 milliliters and the mass, about 500 grams. This led to a project that began in 1999 called ARLISS, involving mostly American and Japanese Universities, carrying out the first launch on September, 11th of that year and continuing each year without interruption.The initial idea, still prevalent today, was to launch 3 satellites of 350 milliliters, or a satellite of greater volume. The means would be a rocket capable of moving 1.8 kilos and of ascending to 4000 meters, opening the door to low cost space flights -about $400.In 2000, the missions were very different: for instance, calculating the opening of a landing system using data provided by the barometer or making use of a  differential GPS  system. The project came to a more complex situation in 2001 when the ComeBack category was added, according to which the satellite should be directed to a particular target. This mission was very successful and, in 2002, students of Space Robotics Lab of the  Tohoku University  went up to 45 meters from the target and, in 2006, this figure dropped to 6 meters.Interest in this type of satellite has been growing and spreading. In 2003, the  University of Tokyo  placed into orbit two satellites  CubeSat, satellites of a size slightly larger than the CanSats, and cube shaped.

Tumbling typically occurs as soon as a CubeSat is deployed, due to asymmetric deployment forces and bumping with other CubeSats. Some CubeSats operate normally while tumbling, but those that require pointing in a certain direction or cannot operate safely while spinning, must be detumbled. Systems that perform attitude determination and control include  reaction wheel s,  magnetorquer s, thrusters,  star tracker s,  Sun sensor s, Earth sensors,  angular rate sensor s, and  GPS receivers and antennas. Combinations of these systems are typically seen in order to take each method's advantages and mitigate their shortcomings.  Reaction wheels  are commonly utilized for their ability to impart relatively large  moments  for any given energy input, but reaction wheel's utility is limited due to saturation, the point at which a wheel cannot spin faster. Examples of CubeSat reaction wheels include the Maryland Aerospace MAI-101 and the Sinclair Interplanetary RW-0.03-4. Reaction wheels can be desaturated with the use of thrusters or magnetorquers. Thrusters can provide large moments by imparting a  couple  on the spacecraft but inefficiencies in small propulsion systems cause thrusters to run out of fuel rapidly. Commonly found on nearly all CubeSats are magnetorquers which run electricity through a  solenoid  to take advantage of Earth's magnetic field to produce a  turning moment.
