In the Hesiodic scheme there were five ages of mankind: the  Golden Age,  Silver Age, Bronze Age,  Heroic Age  and the present age, that of Iron. Race of gold man lived in the time of  Cronus, an age of plenty and peace, for the earth gave for all their needs of its own accord and rivalries of any kind were thus unknown. Golden Age man never aged, and when they died they went as though to sleep. When this age came to an end, its population became guardians of mankind, protecting them from evils and granting them wealth. The Silver Age was much worse than the Golden, both in stature and temperament. They lived as children with their mothers for a hundred years. Once they came of age, they lived but a brief time, suffering because of their foolishness. They fought with one another and did not mind the gods. Angry at their impiety, Zeus destroyed the race; still, they are granted the honor of being called \" chthonic  blessed mortals\". The Bronze Race was fearsome and warlike. Their weapons were bronze, they lived in bronze houses and worked in bronze: black iron did not exist yet. They fell at each other's hands and came to an inglorious end. The race of  hero es was more just and noble. Though  demigods, they too fell in war, most notably those at  Thebes  and  Troy. After death they were transported to the  Isles of the Blessed  where they lived a post mortum life of plenty similar to the Golden Age. Hesiod then laments that he lived during the Iron Age which is characterized by toil and hardship. He predicts that Zeus will destroy his race, too, when men are born gray-haired and all moral and religious standards are ignored.

Smith, in The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture, prefer to speak of an era of invention, proliferation, diversification, etc. Consideration of  comic strip s in the general history of comics has led some, including Steve Geppi, adding two periods before the Golden Age: the Victorian period (from the beginning, from 1828 to 1882) and the Platinum Age (the period of comic strips). In fact, originally only the golden age and the silver age had a right of citizenship since the terms Golden Age and Silver Age had appeared in a letter from a reader published in the n\u00ba 42 of  Justice League of America  in February 1966 that stated: \"If you guys keep bringing back the heroes from the Golden Age, people 20 years from now will be calling this decade the Silver Sixties!\"", "qas": [{"id": "question_1044", "question": "What did this do", "answers": [{"text": "In A Complete History of American Comic Books,  Shirrel Rhoades  resumes the canonical division but cites  ", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1045", "question": "What did Steve Geppi propose?", "answers": [{"text": "Ken Quattro, who proposes three heroic periods (from 1938 to 1955, from 1956 to 1986 and from 1986 until today)", "answer_start": 107}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1046", "question": "What did Randy Duncan cite", "answers": [{"text": "Rhoades also cites  Steve Geppi  who, taking into account comic strips, divides the history of comics in ages  ", "answer_start": 219}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1047", "question": "What era is the article about?", "answers": [{"text": "Victorian  ", "answer_start": 330}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1048", "question": "What else did Steve Geppi cite", "answers": [{"text": "(Victorian Age, from 1828 to 1882), of platinum (Platinum Age, from 1882 to 1938), of gold (Golden Age, from 1938 to 1945)", "answer_start": 341}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1049", "question": "What is one of the areas that Steve Geppi noted?", "answers": [{"text": ",  atomic  (Atom Age, from 1946 to 1956), of silver (Silver Age, from 1956 to 1971), of bronze (Bronze Age, from 1971 to 1985), of copper (Copper Age, from 1986 to 1992), of  chrome  ", "answer_start": 463}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_1050", "question": "What did Randy Duncan and Matthew J.
