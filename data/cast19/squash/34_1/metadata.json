{"input_text": "With the death of Tiglath-Pileser I Assyria entered a period of decline during what is referred to as the Ancient Dark Ages (1075-912 BC)in the region that corresponded to the  collapse of the Bronze Age . The last 300 years of the Assyrian Empire (Neo-Assyrian Empire) from 911-627 BC saw a renewed expansion including attacks on the Neo-Hittite states to its north and west.  Ashurnasirpal II  (883\u2013859 BC) extracted tribute from Phrygia while his successor  Shalmaneser III  (858\u2013823 BC) also attacked Urartu forcing his Anatolian neighbours to pay tribute. After his death the land was torn by civil war. Assyrian power continued to wax and wane with periodic incursions into the Anatolian lands.  Sennacherib  (705-681 BC) encountered and drove back a new force in the region, the  Greeks  who attempted to settle Cilicia. His successor  Esarhaddon  (680-669 BC) was responsible for the final destruction of  Urartu . Ashurbanipal (669-627 BC) then extended Assyrian influence still further placing Caria, Cilicia, Lydia and  Cappadocia  into  vasselage .\nBronze Age Britain  had large reserves of  tin  in  Cornwall  and  Devon , and tin is necessary to  smelt   bronze . At that time the sea level was much lower, and so tin for export could be brought across the  Solent  at low tide on carts, or possibly on boats such as those found at  Ferriby . A shortage of tin during the  Bronze Age collapse  and trade disruptions in the  Mediterranean  around 1300 BCE may have forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze.\nDespite the loss of territory, military weakness, and evident reduction in literacy and culture, the Kassite dynasty was the longest-lived dynasty of Babylon, lasting until 1155 BC, when Babylon was conquered by Shutruk-Nakhunte of Elam, and reconquered a few years later by the  Nebuchadnezzar I , part of the larger Late Bronze Age collapse.\nGaza enjoyed demographic and economic growth again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle Tell as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization and all of the cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd century BCE. In its place emerged semi-nomadic cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the  Early Bronze Age IV . An urban center known as  Tell al-Ajjul  began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the  Middle Bronze Age , Tell as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in  Canaan ite territory, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite  Hyksos , a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. This city was destroyed about a century later, when the Hyksos were routed from Egypt. Egypt settled Gaza once again and Tell al-Ajjul rose for the third time in the 15th century BCE. The city finally ceased to exist in the 14th century, at the end of the Bronze Age.\nIn the 13th century BCE, at the end of the  Bronze Age , seafaring invaders from  Europe  and the  Aegean  known as the  Sea Peoples  entered the  Eastern Mediterranean , invading  Anatolia ,  Syria ,  Canaan ,  Cyprus  and  Egypt . The invasions by the Sea Peoples ushered the  Bronze Age Collapse , which resulted in the cultural collapse of  Mycenean Greece , the  Hittite Empire , the  New Kingdom of Egypt  and the civilizations of Canaan and Syria. The Sea Peoples are regarded as being composed of various groups of  Indo-European  peoples.\nThe 12th century BC is the period from 1200 to 1101 BC. The  Late Bronze Age collapse  in the  ancient Near East  and  eastern Mediterranean  is often considered to begin in this century.\nThe first excavations at Tel \u2018Afula, carried out in 1948, found Late Chalcolithic\u2013Early Bronze Age remains. Tombs from the Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age II, Late Bronze Age\u2013Iron Age I and Roman period were discovered near the municipal water tower. Archaeologists discovered the Crusader-Mamluk fortress on the southern peak of the  tell , a Byzantine olive press and evidence of an Early Bronze Age settlement near the northern peak.\nParshatatar  of  Mitanni  conquered Aleppo, and the city became part of that kingdom until conquered by  Suppiluliuma I  of the Hittites in the 14th century BC. Suppiluliuma installed his son Telipinus as king of Aleppo. Not all the kings of this dynasty are known. The Hittite dynasty remained in power until the  Late Bronze Age collapse .\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age Tell es-Sultan was a small prominent city of the  Canaan  region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the  Maryannu , a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the  Mitanni te state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"...the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment... part of a complex system\" of defenses (pp. 213\u2013218). The Bronze-Age city fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617\u20131530 BCE. Notably this carbon dating  1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating  1550 by Kenyon.\nThe region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and  civilization . During the  Bronze Age , independent  Canaan ite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt,  Mesopotamia ,  Phoenicia ,  Minoan  Crete, and Syria. Between 1550\u20131400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian  New Kingdom  who held power until the 1178 BCE  Battle of Djahy (Canaan)  during the wider  Bronze Age collapse . The Israelites emerged from a dramatic social transformation that took place in the people of the central hill country of Canaan around 1200 BCE, with no signs of violent invasion or even of peaceful infiltration of a clearly defined ethnic group from elsewhere.\nUnlike many other neighboring states, the  Bronze Age collapse  had only a slight impact on Cyprus; in fact, the period immediately following the dramatic events of the collapse was the flourishing of the island culture, with visible increase of use of the script in such centers as  Enkomi . On the other hand, as a direct result of this collapse, the script ceased to exist in  Ugarit , together with the polis itself. Since then, the number of Greek artifacts gradually  increases in the Cypriot context, and around 950 BC the Cypro-Minoan script suddenly disappears, being soon substituted by the new  Cypriot syllabary , whose inscriptions represent mainly the  Greek language , with just a few short texts in  Eteocypriot language .\nThe  Bronze Age Collapse  from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a  dark age  for the entire  Near East ,  North Africa ,  Asia Minor ,  Caucasus ,  Mediterranean , and  Balkan  regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.\nThe end of the Ottom\u00e1ny culture is connected with turbulent events at the end of Old Bronze Age in Central Europe, where there was a collapse of the whole \"Old Bronze Age world\" with its highly advanced culture of mighty hill-forts, rich burials, and trade over wast distances. The gradual decline in the number of fortified settlements, change of burial rites, and the decision of people to desert fortified settlements could have had several reasons, including the collapse of trade and exchange networks, the attacks of enemies, the internal collapse of society or environmental causes. The following Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age cultures are very different in their burial rites (cremation, erecting of barrows) as well as in their handling of bronze - there is an \"explosion\" in bronze working, and many bronze hoards found across all of Europe illustrate this change in quantity and quality of produced bronze objects. We see not only bronze ornaments and arms (including first examples of  sword s), but also bronze tools ( sickle s,  axe s,  adze s), which changed the everyday life of prehistoric man.\nBronze Age collapse theories have described aspects of the end of the Age in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean region, the  Mycenaean  administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy. Several Minoan  client states  lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the  breadbasket  of the Minoan empire, the area north of the  Black Sea , also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some capacity to cultivate crops.\nTell Sukas was located at the center of the fertile plain of Jableh on a hill with access to two natural harbors. There is evidence of an earlier  Neolithic  settlement at the site dating back to the seventh or sixth millennium BC.  The site was identified as ancient Suksi, which was mentioned in the  Ugarit  tablets and was probably the southernmost port of the Kingdom of Ugarit. The  Bronze Age  settlement was probably destroyed along with the capital, Ugarit, during the  Bronze Age collapse . The site was reused shortly thereafter and commercial activity at the  Iron Age  settlement can be traced again to at least the tenth century BC, when it became the port of  Luhuti , A  Phoenician  settlement was established in the eighth century BC and the town thrived as a  Greek  trading outpost between c. 850 BC and c. 550 BC, when it was destroyed by the  Babylonians . Recent excavations reveal that the site was inhabited again by the Phoenicians between 380 and 69 BC until it was destroyed again, possibly by an earthquake. It was later re-occupied for a short period by the  Crusaders .\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the name given by those historians who see the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age  as violent, sudden and culturally disruptive, expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Middle East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the  Dark Age  that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite  and  Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nIncreasingly, the Iron Age in Europe is being seen as a part of the  Bronze Age collapse  in the  ancient Near East , in   ancient India  (with the post- Rigvedic   Vedic civilization ),  ancient Iran , and  ancient Greece  (with the  Greek Dark Ages ). In other regions of  Europe , the Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in  Central Europe  and the 6th century BC in  Northern Europe . The Near Eastern Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200\u20131000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous  Late Bronze Age . There is no definitive cultural break between the 13th and 12th century BC throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country,  Transjordan , and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the  Aramaean  and  Sea People  groups. There is evidence, however, that shows strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late 2nd millennium.\nThis  Bronze Age  civilisation collapsed around the middle of the second millennium BCE. Around this time,  Indo-Iranian-speaking pastoralists  from Central Asia migrated to the region. They brought the  Indo-Aryan languages  with them and established the  Iron Age   Vedic Civilisation , which extended over much of the  Indo-Gangetic plain  and which witnessed the rise of major polities known as the  Mahajanapadas . In one of these kingdoms,  Magadha ,  Mahavira  and  Gautama Buddha  were born in the 6th or 5th century BCE and propagated their  Shramanic  philosophies.\nAfter 1180s BCE, amid general turmoil in the  Levant  associated with the sudden arrival of the  Sea Peoples , and the  collapse of the Bronze Age  the empire disintegrated into several independent  Syro-Hittite  (Neo-Hittite) city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BCE. In the West, Greeks were arriving on the Anatolian coast, and the  Kaskas  along the northern Black Sea coast. Eventually  Hattusha  itself was destroyed around 1200 BCE and the age of Empires shifted to that of regional states as the Bronze Age transitioned into the Iron Age.\nThe historical backdrop of the poem is the time of the  Late Bronze Age collapse , in the early 12th century BC. Homer is thus separated from his subject matter by about 400 years, the period known as the  Greek Dark Ages . Intense scholarly debate has surrounded the question of which portions of the poem preserve genuine traditions from the  Mycenaean period . The  Catalogue of Ships  in particular has the striking feature that its geography does not portray Greece in the  Iron Age , the time of Homer, but as it was before the  Dorian invasion .\nThe  Thera eruption  occurred around the Aegean Collapse,  north of Crete. Speculation include a  tsunami  from Thera (more commonly known today as Santorini) destroyed Cretan cities. A tsunami may have destroyed the Cretan  navy  in its home harbour, which then lost crucial naval battles; so that in the  LMIB/LMII  event (c. 1450 BC) the cities of  Crete  burned and the  Mycenaean civilization  took over  Knossos . If the eruption occurred in the late 17th century BC (as most chronologists now think) then its immediate effects belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition, and not to the end of the Late Bronze Age; but it could have triggered the instability that led to the collapse first of Knossos and then of Bronze Age society overall. One such theory looks to the role of Cretan expertise in administering the empire, post-Thera. If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, then the Mycenaeans may have made political and commercial mistakes in administering the Cretan empire.\nNorthwest Semitic is a division of the  Semitic language family  comprising the indigenous languages of the  Levant .It would have emerged from  Common Semitic  in the  Early Bronze Age . It is first attested in proper names identified as  Amorite  in the  Middle Bronze Age . The oldest coherent texts are in  Ugaritic , dating to the   Late Bronze Age , which by the time of the  Bronze Age collapse  are joined by  Old Aramaic , and by the  Iron Age  by the  Canaanite languages  ( Phoenician  and  Hebrew ).\nThe 10th century BC started the first day of  1000 BC  and ended the last day of  901 BC . This period followed the  Bronze Age collapse  in the  Near East , and the century saw the  Early Iron Age  take hold there. The  Greek Dark Ages  which had come about in 1200 BC continued. The  Neo-Assyrian Empire  is established towards the end of the 10th century BC. In  Iron Age India , the  Vedic period  is ongoing. In  China , the  Zhou Dynasty  is in power. The  European Bronze Age  continued with  Urnfield culture .  Japan  was inhabited by an evolving  hunter-gatherer  society during the  Jomon period .\nThe area of Kabri was first settled during the PN by members of the  Yarmoukian  culture. In the early  Chalcolithic  period (4500\u20133500 BC), Kabri was a major centre of the  Wadi Raba  culture. In the Early Bronze (EB) Age (3500-2100 BC), there was a town on the side of the tel that was destroyed as part of the region-wide  systems collapse  that characterised the EB collapse.  In the early and middle MB I, Tel Kabri \u2013 along with  Megiddo ,  Aphek , and  Akko  \u2013 was one of the earliest cities in the Levant to rebuild its fortifications following the EB collapse. The new city was confined to the northern part of the earlier EB tel.\nIndus Valley Civilization  is considered as  Bronze Age   Civilization  (3300\u20131300 BCE; mature period 2600\u20131900 BCE)with  Mesopotamia  and  Ancient Egypt  as its contemporaries. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of well over five million. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley, Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving), and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin. The civilization is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multi-storey houses. The mature phase of this civilization is known as the Harappan Civilization which overlapped the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age; thus it is difficult to date this transition accurately. The declining period of the IVC from about 1,900 BC and most widely accepted factor of this decline is ecological change due to which migrations occurred. Shaffer & Lichtenstein (in ) stated that: \"This shift by Harappan and, perhaps, other Indus Valley cultural mosaic groups, is the only archaeologically documented west-to-east movement of human populations in South Asia before the first half of the first millennium B.C..\" This could have been caused by ecological factors, such as the drying up of the  Ghaggar-Hakra River  and increased aridity in  Rajasthan  and other places. The Indus River also began to flow east and floodings occurred. Shaffer (as cited in ) contends: \"There were no invasions from central or western South Asia. Rather there were several internal cultural adjustments reflecting altered ecological, social and economic conditions affecting northwestern and north-central South Asia\". However, Indo-Aryan migration into this region is noted as approximately contemporaneous to the final phase of the decline of the  Indus-Valley civilization  (IVC).\nThe Hittites () were an  Ancient Anatolian people  who established an empire centered on  Hattusa  in north-central  Anatolia  around 1600 BC. This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under  Suppiluliuma I , when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern  Levant  and  Upper Mesopotamia . Between the 15th and 13th centuries BC the  Hittite Empire  came into conflict with the  Egyptian Empire ,  Middle Assyrian Empire  and the empire of the  Mitanni  for control of the  Near East . The  Assyrians  eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire, while the remainder was sacked by  Phrygian  newcomers to the region. After c. 1180 BC, during the  Bronze Age collapse , the Hittites splintered into several independent \" Neo-Hittite \" city-states, some of which survived until the 8th century BC before succumbing to the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nThe Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of  ironworking  technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in the present  Bulgaria  and  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.\nRobert Drews describes the collapse as \"the worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\" A number of people have spoken of the cultural memories of the disaster as stories of a \"lost  golden age \".  Hesiod  for example spoke of Ages of Gold, Silver, and Bronze, separated from the modern harsh cruel world of the Age of Iron by the  Age of Heroes . Rodney Castledon even suggests that memories of the Bronze Age collapse even influenced  Plato 's story of  Atlantis  in  Timaeus  and the  Critias .\nTowards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist  Chalcolithic  civilizations began to rise in various  \"cradles\"  from around 3300 BCE. Chalcolithic civilizations, as defined above, also developed in  Pre-Columbian Americas  and, despite an early start in Egypt,  Axum  and  Kush , much later in  Iron Age   sub-Saharan Africa . The  Bronze Age collapse  was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which German psychiatrist and philosopher  Karl Jaspers  termed the  Axial Age , and which he claimed was a critical  transitional phase leading to  Classical civilization . A major technological and cultural transition to  modernity  began approximately 1500 CE in  Western Europe , and from this beginning new approaches to  science  and  law  spread rapidly around the world, incorporating earlier cultures into the industrial and technological civilization of the present.\nArchaeologists believe that the community was destroyed by a fire at the end of the Bronze Age, which damaged the posts that held the homes above the waterlogged earth, causing the dwellings to collapse into the river and forcing the inhabitants to hastily flee. The effects of the fire then carbonized the remains of the collapsed buildings, helping to preserve them.\nThe  Bronze Age collapse  is the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age , expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Near East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a \"catastrophe\". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BCE. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled  Neo-Hittite   Aramaean  kingdoms of the mid-10th century BCE, and the rise of the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nThe  Late Bronze Age collapse  saw methodical invasion and destruction of cities, populations, wealth and means of production by competing tribal groups, states and empires in the eastern Mediterranean. Although cities had been sacked before, the systematic nature and scale of these campaigns stand out.\nUsing the  Palmer Drought Index  for 35 Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern weather stations, it was shown that a drought of the kind that persisted from January 1972 would have affected all of the sites associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse. Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socioeconomic problems and led to wars.\nThe site of Sz\u00e1zhalombatta is 200 m by 100 m in area. It is estimated that up to two thirds of the original area was destroyed during clay extraction by a local brick factory and by  erosion  from the River Danube.The Bronze Age settlement was built on a bluff with valleys to north and south, the  River Danube  to the east and it was fortified with a ditch to the west, a feature common to other  Vatya   tell s. It was strategically positioned at the end of the  Benta valley , potentially controlling access to other sites including smaller settlements within the valley. It overlooks a long stretch of the River Danube and may have been involved in river-borne trade and communication.The settlement was first occupied at the end of the  Early Bronze Age  (the transition from the classic Nagyr\u00e9v (Szigetszentmikl\u00f3s) to the late Nagyr\u00e9v (Kulcs). It was continuously inhabited through the Middle Bronze Age Vatya and  Vatya-Koszider  period. This was followed by a hiatus in occupation until the  Urnfield  phase of the  Late Bronze Age  from which there are only a few traces. Occupation layers at the site are up to 6 m deep. Finds from the site include pottery, daub, plaster, metalwork, moulds, loom weights,  bone tool s,  antler  objects, ground stone,  lithics ,  amber , animal and occasional human bones. Many of the Bronze Age houses were burnt. This has resulted in outstanding preservation of organic material including botanical remains such as  thatch  from house roofs and Bronze Age food like  crabapple s, peas, beans and lentils. There is also worked wood and basketry. Thin section soil micromorphology,  phytolith s,  charcoal  and  coprolite s add to the data from the site.\nTablet RS 18.38 from  Ugarit  also mentions grain to the Hittites, suggesting a long period of famine, connected further, in the full theory, to drought. Barry Weiss, using the  Palmer Drought Index  for 35 Greek, Turkish, and Middle Eastern weather stations, showed that a drought of the kinds that persisted from January 1972 would have affected all of the sites associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse. Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socio-economic problems and led to wars. More recently,  Brian Fagan  has shown how mid-winter storms from the Atlantic were diverted to travel north of the Pyrenees and the Alps, bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe, but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean.  More recent  paleoclimatological research  has also shown climatic disruption and increasing aridity in the Eastern Mediterranean, associated with the  North Atlantic Oscillation  at this time (See  Bronze Age Collapse ).\nHayasa-Azzi or Azzi-Hayasa () was a  Late Bronze Age  confederation formed between two kingdoms of  Armenian Highlands , Hayasa located South of  Trabzon  and Azzi, located north of the  Euphrates  and to the south of Hayasa. The Hayasa-Azzi confederation was in conflict with the  Hittite Empire  in the 14th century BC, leading up to the  collapse of Hatti  around 1190 BC.\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to  Tell es-Sakan , an  Ancient Egyptian  fortress built in  Canaan ite territory to the south of present-day Gaza. The site went into decline throughout the  Early Bronze Age II  as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased. Another urban center known as  Tell al-Ajjul  began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the  Middle Bronze Age , a revived  Tell es-Sakan  became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort. In 1650 BCE, when the Canaanite  Hyksos  occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BCE, at the end of the Bronze Age.\nThe  Myth of the Ages  follows. In the Hesiodic scheme there were five ages of mankind: the  Golden Age ,  Silver Age , Bronze Age,  Heroic Age  and the present age, that of Iron. Race of gold man lived in the time of  Cronus , an age of plenty and peace, for the earth gave for all their needs of its own accord and rivalries of any kind were thus unknown. Golden Age man never aged, and when they died they went as though to sleep. When this age came to an end, its population became guardians of mankind, protecting them from evils and granting them wealth. The Silver Age was much worse than the Golden, both in stature and temperament. They lived as children with their mothers for a hundred years. Once they came of age, they lived but a brief time, suffering because of their foolishness. They fought with one another and did not mind the gods. Angry at their impiety, Zeus destroyed the race; still, they are granted the honor of being called \" chthonic  blessed mortals\". The Bronze Race was fearsome and warlike. Their weapons were bronze, they lived in bronze houses and worked in bronze: black iron did not exist yet. They fell at each other's hands and came to an inglorious end. The race of  hero es was more just and noble. Though  demigods , they too fell in war, most notably those at  Thebes  and  Troy . After death they were transported to the  Isles of the Blessed  where they lived a post mortum life of plenty similar to the Golden Age. Hesiod then laments that he lived during the Iron Age which is characterized by toil and hardship. He predicts that Zeus will destroy his race, too, when men are born gray-haired and all moral and religious standards are ignored.  Aidos  and  Nemesis  will depart the earth, leaving behind ills against which there will be no bulwark.\nThe archaeological evidence shows a widespread  collapse of Bronze Age civilization  in the Eastern Mediterranean world at the outset of the period, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. Around then, the  Hittite  civilization suffered serious disruption and cities from  Troy  to  Gaza  were destroyed. Following the collapse, fewer and smaller settlements suggest famine and depopulation. In Greece, the  Linear B  writing of the  Greek language  used by Mycenaean bureaucrats ceased. The decoration on  Greek pottery  after about 1100 BC lacks the figurative decoration of Mycenaean ware and is restricted to simpler, generally geometric styles (1000\u2013700 BC).\nThe development of iron smelting was once attributed to the  Hittites  of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. It was believed that they maintained a monopoly on ironworking, and that their empire had been based on that advantage. Accordingly, the invading  Sea Peoples  were responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. This theory is no longer held in the common current thought of the majority of scholarship, since there is no archaeological evidence of the alleged Hittite monopoly. While there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period; and only a small number of these objects are weapons. As part of the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age, the  Bronze Age collapse  saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region. The  Ugaritic script  was in use during this time, around 1300 BC.  Ugarit  was one of the centres of the literate world.\nIn Egypt, Ramesses III was fighting to save his country and Empire in the midst of the Bronze Age collapse, a prolonged period of region-wide droughts, crop failures, depopulation, and collapse of urban centers.  It is likely that the Nile irrigated lands remained fruitful and would have been highly desirable to Egypt\u2019s neighbors. During this chaotic time, a new warlike group of people from the north, the Sea People, repeatedly attacked and plundered various Near Eastern powers.\nThere are some objections to the interpretation of the structure as being a road at all, including the fact that several burial  cist s along the structure's course protrude through its surface by up to 0.4m, highly unusual for a road surface. Since 1997, authorities including English Heritage have accepted the possibility that the structure may not be a road. Archaeological consultant Blaise Vyner suggested in 1997 that the structure may be the collapsed and heavily robbed remains of a  Neolithic  or  Bronze Age  boundary wall or dyke. There are other Neolithic remains on the North York Moors, including boundary dikes, although Knight et al. report that the later Neolithic is very poorly represented archaeologically in the North York Moors area and neolithic use of the moors was likely very limited in extent. Bronze Age presence in the moors, including earthworks, is well represented generally in the archaeology of the area, and therefore is a more plausible origin. Evidence against the identification of the causeway as an early Neolithic structure includes the statement by Elgee in 1912 that the causeway had been identified as cutting across an earlier British earthwork just north of Julian Park, suggesting that it must post-date it. One possibility that could explain several of the anomalies in trying to definitively identify the site is the suggestion by Knight et al. that it was commonly observed practice in the area for dykes to be reused as trackways.\nThe Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the  Greek Dark Ages , that lasted for more than 400 years. Other cities like  Athens  continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover. These sites in Greece show evidence of the collapse:\nIn A Complete History of American Comic Books,  Shirrel Rhoades  resumes the canonical division but cites  Ken Quattro , who proposes three heroic periods (from 1938 to 1955, from 1956 to 1986 and from 1986 until today) Rhoades also cites  Steve Geppi  who, taking into account comic strips, divides the history of comics in ages  Victorian  (Victorian Age, from 1828 to 1882), of platinum (Platinum Age, from 1882 to 1938), of gold (Golden Age, from 1938 to 1945),  atomic  (Atom Age, from 1946 to 1956), of silver (Silver Age, from 1956 to 1971), of bronze (Bronze Age, from 1971 to 1985), of copper (Copper Age, from 1986 to 1992), of  chrome  (Chrome Age, from 1992 to 1999), and modern (Modern Age, since 2000).  Randy Duncan  and  Matthew J. Smith , in The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture, prefer to speak of an era of invention, proliferation, diversification, etc. Consideration of  comic strip s in the general history of comics has led some, including Steve Geppi, adding two periods before the Golden Age: the Victorian period (from the beginning, from 1828 to 1882) and the Platinum Age (the period of comic strips). In fact, originally only the golden age and the silver age had a right of citizenship since the terms Golden Age and Silver Age had appeared in a letter from a reader published in the n\u00ba 42 of  Justice League of America  in February 1966 that stated: \"If you guys keep bringing back the heroes from the Golden Age, people 20 years from now will be calling this decade the Silver Sixties!\"\nAn archaeological mound situated near the village of Wadi al-Far'a, Tell el-Far'ah (North), has been identified as the location of  biblical   Tirzah . The tell has occupation layers from the  Neolithic ,  Chalcolithic ,  Bronze Age , and  Iron Age . It is called Tell el-Far'ah (North) in order to distinguish it from  Tell el-Far'ah (South) , an archaeological site south of  Gaza .\nFurthermore, in some cases, later Bronze-age peoples built their own sites over the Neolithic temples, thus adding an element of confusion to early researchers who did not have modern dating technology.  Sir Temi \u017bammit , an eminent Maltese archaeologist of the late nineteenth century, had dated the Neolithic temples to 2800 BC and the Tarxien  Bronze Age  culture to 2000 BC. These dates were considered \"considerably too high\" by scholars, who proposed a reduction of half a millennium each. However, radiocarbon testing favoured \u017bammit\u2019s dating. A theory that the temple art was connected with an  Aegean -derived culture collapsed with this proof of the temples' elder origins.\nThe Mycenaean civilization perished with the  collapse of Bronze-Age civilization  on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the  Dorian invasion , although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well. Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after  LH III C , when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the  Greek Dark Ages  of traditional historiography.\nThe growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include interruption of maritime trade by piracy by the  Sea Peoples , as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the Dorian migration or invasion.\nThe history of India begins with evidence of human activity of Homo sapiens, as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier hominids including Homo erectus from about 500,000 years ago. The Indus Valley Civilisation, which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent from c. 3300 to 1300 BC in present-day Pakistan and northwest India, was the first major civilisation in South Asia. A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BC.This Bronze Age civilisation collapsed before the end of the second millennium BC and was followed by the Iron Age Vedic Civilisation, which extended over much of the Indo-Gangetic plain and which witnessed the rise of major polities known as the Mahajanapadas. In one of these kingdoms, (Magadha), Mahavira and Gautama Buddha were born in the 6th or 5th century BC and propagated their Shramanic philosophies.Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Various parts of India ruled by numerous Middle kingdoms for the next 1,500 years, among which the Gupta Empire stands out. Southern India saw the rule of the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas, Pandyas and Cheras. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or \"Golden Age of India\". During this period, aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 AD.\nOut of the  Late Bronze Age   Urnfield culture  of the 12th century BCE developed the Early Iron Age  Hallstatt culture  of Central Europe from the eighth to sixth centuries BCE, which was followed by the  La T\u00e8ne culture  of Central Europe (450 BCE to 1st century BCE). Albeit the metal iron came into wider use by  metalsmith s in the Mediterranean as far back as c. 1300 BCE due to the  Late Bronze Age collapse , the Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe started only as early as the 5th/4th to the 1st century BCE.\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse was a  Dark Age  transition period in the  Aegean Region ,  Southwestern Asia  and the  Eastern Mediterranean  from the Late  Bronze Age  to the Early  Iron Age  that historians believe was violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. The  palace economy  of the Aegean Region and  Anatolia  that characterised the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the  Greek Dark Ages .\nA more recent theory claims that the development of iron technology was driven by the disruption of the  copper  and  tin  trade routes, due to the collapse of the empires at the end of the Late Bronze Age.  These metals, especially tin, were not widely available and metal workers had to transport them over long distances, whereas iron ores were widely available. However, no known archaeological evidence suggests a shortage of bronze or tin in the Early Iron Age.  Bronze objects remained abundant, and these objects have the same percentage of tin as those from the Late Bronze Age.\nThe collapse of the Hittite Empire is usually associated with the gradual decline of Eastern Mediterranean trade networks and the resulting  collapse of major Late Bronze Age cities  in the Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean.At the beginning of the 12th century BC,  Wilusa  ( Troy ) was destroyed and the  Hittite Empire  suffered a sudden devastating attack from the  Kaskas , who occupied the coasts around the  Black Sea , and who joined with the  Mysians . They proceeded to destroy almost all Hittite sites but  were finally defeated by the  Assyria ns beyond the southern borders near the  Tigris .   Hatti ,  Arzawa  ( Lydia ),  Alashiya  ( Cyprus ),  Ugarit  and  Alalakh  were destroyed.\nGower is also home to  menhir s or standing stones from the  Bronze Age . Of the nine stones, eight remain today. One of the most notable of the stones is Arthur's stone near  Cefn Bryn . Its 25-ton capstone was most likely a glacial erratic (a piece of rock/conglomerate carried by glacial ice some distance from the rock outcrop from which it came): the builders dug under it and supported it with upright stones to create a burial chamber. The remains of Sweyne Howes on Rhossili Down, Penmaen Burrows Tomb (Pen-y-Crug) and Nicholaston Long Cairn are three other well-known Neolithic chambered tombs. During the Bronze Age, people continued to use local caves for shelter and for burying their dead. Bronze Age evidence, such as funeral urns, pottery and human remains, has been found in  Tooth Cave  at Llethryd,  Culver Hole  (Port Eynon) and  Cat Hole Cave . With the transition into the Iron Age, hill forts (timber fortifications on hill tops and coastal promontories) and earthworks began to appear. The largest example of this type of Iron Age settlement in the Gower Peninsula is  Cilifor Top  near Llanrhidian.\nThe earliest migrations we can reconstruct from historical sources are those of the 2nd millennium BC. The  Proto-Indo-Iranians  began their expansion from c. 2000 BC, the  Rigveda  documenting the presence of early  Indo-Aryans  in the  Punjab  from the late 2nd millennium BC, and  Iranian tribes  being attested in Assyrian sources as in the  Iranian plateau  from the 9th century BC. In the  Late Bronze Age , the  Aegean  and  Anatolia  were overrun by moving populations, summarized as the \" Sea Peoples \", leading to the collapse of the  Hittite Empire  and ushering in the  Iron Age .\nThis lecture covers the history of Mesopotamia from the disintegration of the Sumerian Empire to the great Bronze Age collapse. We'll explore the destructive force of the Elamites and the Hittites as well as the imperial ambitions of the Babylonians, the Mittani and the Assyrians.\nAt the end of the Bronze Age, the tin needed to make bronze could no longer be acquired With the collapse of the Bronze Age around 1200 B.C.E., trade networks fell apart. This had many consequences for Bronze Age civilizations. One of the most catastrophic was that they could no longer acquire the tin they needed to make bronze. Differences Between Iron and Bronze\nThe history of Greece went through these stages: 1  Mycenaean culture (c.1600\u00e2\u0080\u0093c.1100 BC) was an early Greek culture during the Bronze Age, on the Greek mainland and on Crete. 2  The bronze age collapse or Greek dark ages (c.1100\u00e2\u0080\u0093c.750 BC). 3  The archaic period (c.750\u00e2\u0080\u0093c.500 BC).\nCoordinator: Prof Irene Lemos. The period between the collapse of the Bronze Age civilisations of Crete and mainland Greece and the society based on city states ('poleis') which emerges from the earliest Greek historical sources is a complex one.\nWith the mysterious end of the Mycenaean civilization during the Bronze Age Collapse around 1200 BCE (possibly through earthquake, invasion or in-fighting) came the so-called Dark Ages and it would be many centuries before Greek culture would finally regain the heights of the late Bronze Age.\nThe decline of Bronze-Age civilizations in Egypt, Greece and Mesopotamia has been attributed to a long-term drought that began around 2000 bc. Now palaeoclimatologists propose that a similar fate was followed by the enigmatic Indus Valley Civilization, at about the same time.\nMycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze-Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean. Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Sea People \u00e2\u0080\u009d.he Late Helladic period is further divided into LHI, LHII, both of which coincide with the early period of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1650\u00e2\u0080\u00931425 BC), and LHIII (c. 1425\u00e2\u0080\u00931050 BC), the period of expansion, decline and collapse of the Mycenaean civilization.\nLinear B, found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos, Cydonia, Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae, disappeared with the fall of Mycenaean civilization during the Late Bronze Age collapse. The succeeding period, known as the Greek Dark Ages, provides no evidence of the use of writing.\nMain articles: Bronze Age and Iron Age. The Bronze Age is part of the three-age system (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age) that for some parts of the world describes effectively the early history of civilization.\nThe two events have traditionally been causally linked, but this is by no means certain. With the Bronze Age collapse, Greece entered into a period of obscurity or 'dark age'. The so-called Mycenaean civilization culminated in this period, which features in the famous epics of Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey.\nGenerally its agreed it started around 3000BC and ended at various time for various regions: Near East: 1200BC. South Asia: 1200BC. Europe: 600BC. China: 700BC. It was followed by the Iron Age (with some transitional periods like the Bronze Age Collapse in the Near East). Views \u00c2\u00b7 View Upvotes.\nThe Bronze Age lasted until the beginning of the Iron Age.    The Bronze Age did not occur all at once in every place. Some cultures never had a Bronze Age at all, jumping directly from mixed copper and stone tools and ornaments (a Chalcolithic Period) to using and/or producing iron tools. Timeline of the Bronze Age The Bronze Age is the middle era of the three early phases in the development of civilization: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.\nIn the Archaeology Odyssey article \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Civilization Collapsed: Death of the Bronze Age,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William H. Stiebing describes the Late Bronze Age collapse: It was a cataclysm of immense proportions: Near the end of the 13th century B.C.E., the great Bronze Age civilizations of the Aegean and Near East suddenly collapsed. In the latter part of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1400\u00e2\u0080\u00931200 B.C.E.), Mycenaean civilization flourished in Greece and Crete.\nSpecial Feature: Read \u00e2\u0080\u009cCity by City: Death of the Bronze Age\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it appeared in the September/October 2001 issue of Archaeology Odyssey below.

The Sea Peoples, a range of groups including the Philistines, led raids on the Eastern Mediterranean during the period of the Bronze Age collapse and are often cited as the reason for the collapse.\nthe iron age was between BC 700 and AD 300 Classically, the Iron Age is taken to begin in the 12th century BC Bronze Age collapse in the ancient Near East, ancient India (with\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the post-Rigvedic Vedic civilization), ancient Iran, and ancient Greece (with the Greek Dark Ages).", "key": "34_1", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.022458", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
