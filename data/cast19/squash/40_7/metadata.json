{"input_text": "James Christopher Monger of  Allmusic  remarked that Wrecktrospective \"sums up the record company\u2019s devotion to all things punk, as in  classic ,  pop , and  skatepunk , alternative  folk ,  post-punk , and  screamo . A decent balance of the old guard and the new (from the  Descendents  to  Against Me! ) keeps things fresh and fun, while the relative brevity of punk songs in general makes for a truly stocked jukebox of high-energy, high-quality, classically minded modern punk.\"\nNew Found Glory are widely recognized for their fast and energetic  pop punk  music. They have since developed a more rounded  rock  sound, including  alternative rock , and  melodic hardcore  styles. The band's traditional sound has been described as \"chunky and melodic\", with  Rolling Stone  noting their penchant for \"catchy, riffy punk-rock.\"  Consequence of Sound  writer Megan Ritt called the band \"paragons\" of the pop punk genre and noted how \"the seasoned Floridian rockers are renowned for their heartfelt guitar anthems.\" The band's music typically builds upon  verse-chorus  song structures, combining pop-influenced  melodies  with fast  punk rock  tempos,  hardcore -tinged  breakdowns , and often  gang vocals . The quintets fifth studio album,  Coming Home  was however marked as a change in direction for the band. It's more layered and mid-tempo sound is regarded as their most mature work and has been described as a \"somber, honest, polished and alternative record.\"\nMany New Pop artists created technologically oriented music that sweetened less commercial and experimental aspects with a  pop  coating.   Entryism  became a popular concept for groups at the time. New Music acts were danceable, had an  androgynous  look, emphasized the  synthesizer  and  drum machine s, wrote about the darker side of romance, and were  British . They rediscovered  rockabilly ,  Motown ,  ska ,  reggae  and merged it with African rhythms to produce what was described as a \"fertile, stylistic cross-pollination\". Author  Simon Reynolds  noted that the New Pop movement \"involved a conscious and brave attempt to bridge the separation between  'progressive' pop  and mass/chart pop \u2013 a divide which has existed since 1967, and is also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.\"\nAmong the fifteen bands and artists contributing to the record are the regionally successful  X-15  and  The Pudz  with their respective tracks Vaporized and Take Me to Your (Leader) as well as post punk acts such as  The Blackouts  and  The Beakers  who were considered very influential on certain bands of the later grunge scene such as  The U-Men ,  Soundgarden  or  The Young Fresh Fellows . Hardcore punk bands  The Fartz  (who would later evolve into  Ten Minute Warning , also of considerable influence on the following generation of Seattle underground rock bands) and  The Refuzors  contribute songs as well as long-lasting  pop punk s,  The Fastbacks  (then with a teenaged  Duff McKagan  on drums who would later join the Fartz and then be a formative member of  Guns N' Roses ).  Jim Basnight  of punk pioneers  The Meyce  and later of power poppers  The Moberlys  is featured with his solo song We'll Always Be in Love. Finally, electronic and avant garde projects like  Savant , Danny Eskenazi's own  K7SS  or  Audio Leter  side project  Body Falling Downstairs  were also included to present a comprehensive picture of the Seattle underground music scene. On the other hand, popular and also commercially successful Seattle  power pop  bands like  The Heats  or  The Cowboys  had been consciously omitted from the record because, according to Neil Hubbard as quoted by Stephen Tow, \"[they] were not a part of the creative scene that later blossomed into the  grunge  scene.\"\nAccording to music critic  David Fricke , \u00a1Uno! is a  power pop  album less polemic and conceptual than American Idiot or 21st Century Breakdown, and  Stephen Thomas Erlewine  said that its music is exclusively power pop and  three-chord  rock songs. It was also characterized as  pop punk  by Scott Kara of  The New Zealand Herald  and Robert Cooke of  The Fly , while Scott Heisel of the  Alternative Press  said that \u00a1Uno! is a  punk rock  album.\nThe American band  Bad Religion , formed in 1979, also helped to lay the groundwork for contemporary pop punk. Bad Religion and some of the other leading bands in Southern California's  hardcore punk  scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist  Ben Myers , Bad Religion \"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\". Meyers wrote that  Descendents  \"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys\u2013inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\". Their positive yet sarcastic approach began to separate them from the more serious hardcore scene. The Descendents' 1982 debut LP  Milo Goes to College  provided the template for the United States' take on the more melodic strains of first wave punk. In addition to the California scene, the band  H\u00fcsker D\u00fc , formed in 1979, in Minnesota. Music writer  Michael Azerrad  asserted in his book  Our Band Could Be Your Life  (2001) that \"H\u00fcsker D\u00fc played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren't antithetical.\" In the 1980s, the term pop punk was used in publications such as  Maximum RocknRoll  to describe bands similar to  Social Distortion ,  Agent Orange ,  The Nip Drivers  and  T.S.O.L. . Bands such as  The Vandals  and  Guttermouth  also contributed to the development of pop punk by creating a style that blended pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics.\nPop punk bands that achieve minimal mainstream success have seen a return to grassroots form, \"the micro-operation style that yielded the results that caught the mainstream\u2019s attention in the first place.\" New Found Glory has continued to tour on the Warped Tour, and had their own  Pop Punks Not Dead Tour , a reworking of an \"old, defiant punk rock battle cry.\"  Chad Gilbert , the band's guitarist, wrote in an op-ed for Alternative Press entitled \"Why Pop-Punk's Not Dead\u2014And Why It Still Matters Today\": \"This isn't a dead genre, and just because there isn't a song on the radio to clarify that shouldn't matter. ... Pop-punk means something to a lot of people and to me, having success as a band in our genre is about longevity, touring a lot and staying true to your fans. It's about us putting our lives on a plate for our fans to take what they want and not jeopardizing our integrity for any reason.\"\nThe Rock n Roll Rats are a  Canadian punk rock  group formed in 2009 in  Calgary ,  Alberta .  The Rock n Roll Rats are influenced by punk rock bands including  The Ramones , The  Forgotten Rebels ,  Teenage Head  and  The Misfits . This pop-punk trio plays three and four chord songs in a medium tempo and often puts the \"hook\" to their songs out front and centre.  The Rock n Roll Rats do not align themselves with any specific ideologies or political views, instead writing songs about such topics as past girlfriends, unreliable cars, or deceased pets.\nThis album marked a sharp and conscious departure from Refused's earlier work. The philosophy of the album, expounded in the ample liner notes and encapsulated in the song \"New Noise\", was that punk and hardcore music could not be anti-establishment by continuing to package revolutionary lyrics in sounds which had been increasingly co-opted into the mainstream. The sound of the record challenged existing punk sensibilities; it can be seen as \"punk\" at a fundamental level and includes experimental combinations of  post-hardcore ,  post-punk ,  techno , and  jazz  sounds. The album reveals musical differences to  pop punk  bands such as  Green Day  and  Blink-182 , and also to even more traditional  punk rock  bands such as  Bad Religion  and  Pennywise .\n\"Kiss & Tell\" is the album's opening number, which sees Gomez experimenting with the use of  drum and bass  and  jungle music . The song is backed by \"punkish\" guitars, hand claps, and shouts of \"Hey!\" It was described as featuring \"attitude\" and \"borrows equally from punk attitude and pop melody.\" \"I Won't Apologize\" lyrically sees Gomez refusing to apologize for the person that she is, and has been described as featuring an \" emo pop \" composition. \"Falling Down\" is an upbeat pop rock and  dance-pop  track which contains a strong use of  drums  and  electric guitar s mixed with predominant \"bloopy  synths \". Gomez claimed the song was \"about Hollywood and what people think about it and essentially how plastic it is sometimes.\" \"I Promise You\" is a mid-tempo  soft rock -inspired song which focuses mainly on the use of a guitar and drums. Lyrically the song sees Gomez promising a lover they will stay together. \"Crush\" is a pop punk song that is also described as having an emo pop tone, and lyrically sees Gomez getting over a former lover. \"Naturally\" is an  electropop  song that features a \"juicy and instantly memorable vocal hook.\" On the song, Gomez sings about how easily feelings for a lover come to her.\nRolling Stone  described the band's sound as \"anthemic, emo-inflected rock\".  A Lesson in Romantics  has been described as  pop punk .  Anywhere but Here  has been described as pop punk and  pop rock .  Mayday Parade  has been described as pop punk and pop rock.  Monsters in the Closet  has been described as pop punk, pop rock and  rock .  Black Lines  has been described as  emo ,  emo pop , pop punk, and rock.\nUp All Night is predominately a  pop music  album which orientates into elements of the  dance-pop ,  teen pop ,  pop rock  and  power pop  genres, with  electropop  and  rock music  influences. Instrumentation throughout the record is provided by guitar strings, drums and a piano. The album opens with lead single \" What Makes You Beautiful \", an uptempo teen pop and power pop song. The opening guitar riff has been noted as similar to that of  Grease  single \" Summer Nights \". \"What Makes You Beautiful\" has a guitar-based chorus;  Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey likened it to a cross between  Pink 's \" Raise Your Glass \" and  McFly 's \" All About You \". It also contains  cowbell  instrumentation, and the  middle eight  consists of an \"oh na na na\" hook. The second song on the album, as well as the second single, \" Gotta Be You \", is a mid-tempo pop rock  ballad . Set in an  orchestral  arrangement, its  instrumentation  includes a guitar, piano lines, and abundant  strings . The  chorus  of the song opens with  falsetto s that are followed by vocal harmonies.\nPower pop  music (as defined by groups such as  Badfinger ,  Cheap Trick ,  The Knack , and  The Romantics ) emerged in mostly the same time-frame and geographical area as punk rock, and they shared a great deal musically in terms of playing short songs loud and fast while trying to emphasize catchy feelings. More melodic and pop-influenced punk music have also often been wrapped alongside power pop bands under the general \" new wave music \" label. A good example of a genre-straddling 'power pop punk' band is the popular  Northern Ireland  group  Protex . However, stylistically and lyrically, power pop bands have tended to have a very not-punk top 40 commercial pop influence and a flashier, heavily teen-pop sense of fashion, especially modern power pop groups such as  Stereo Skyline  and  All Time Low .\nA Loss for Words' music has been described by critics as  pop punk .\nStylistically, \"That's What You Get\" has been labeled as  pop rock ,  pop punk  and  power pop , as well as having influences from  funk  and  disco music . Jonathan Bradley from  Stylus Magazine  described the song as containing a \"relentless assault of sugar-sweet riffs and soaring choruses\".\nPop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a  punk rock  music genre and a  fusion  genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of  pop music . Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock  tempo s,  power chord  changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.\n\"Behind Closed Doors\" is a  rock song  written and performed by British recording artist  Matt Fishel . It incorporates elements of  alternative rock ,  power pop  and  pop punk . The song was released as a single on 9 April 2012 and appears on Fishel's 2013 debut album  Not Thinking Straight .\nFuse said, My Own Worst Enemy' is self-deprecating and catchy, like all good sad  boy band  music. The opening line, 'Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk? / I didn\u2019t mean to call you that' might be the most pop-punk verse ever written\". Lit appeared on Fuse's \"Spin 14 of Pop-Punk's Best One-Hit Wonders\" list.  Consequence of Sound  included Lit on its \"100 Best Pop Punk Bands\" list, calling \"My Own Worst Enemy\" the band's essential track. Zack Ruskin of Consequence of Sound called the song \"an anthemic earworm\".  Spectrum Culture  placed \"My Own Worst Enemy\" sixth on its \"Top 10 Pop Punk and Power Pop Songs of the Modern Era\" list. According to Spectrum Culture, with \"My Own Worst Enemy\" Lit \"demonstrates the adolescent fallouts [sic] that can occur from a post-high school life\". In  CMJ New Music Report  review of A Place in the Sun, \"My Own Worst Enemy\" was on its recommended-tracks list. Becky Kirsch of  PopSugar  called the song an \"awesome '90s\" hit.\nPunk Goes Pop is a  compilation album  part of the Punk Goes Pop series created by  Fearless Records . It contains a collection of songs by various artists performing covers of pop songs. It was released on April 2, 2002. Its success caused Fearless to release more pop cover albums.  there have been five other  Punk Goes Pop albums , more than any other in the franchise.\nJesse & The Rockers was an American  Christian punk / pop punk  group.\nJames Oldham of  NME  called \"My Own Worst Enemy\" \"totally loathsome, poisonous stuff, but quite addictive.\" The song was a late inclusion on NME \"20 Essential Pop Punk Tracks Everyone Should Know\" list. It was featured on  Fuse 's \"14 Best Pop-Punk One-Hit Wonders\", and the channel called the song \"self-deprecating and catchy\". \"My Own Worst Enemy\" appeared on the  Phoenix New Times  \"10 Best Pop-Punk Songs of All Time\" list. Daniel J. Katz of  The Tech  criticized the song's parent album: \"Recipe for a one-hit wonder: Start with  Eve 6 / Harvey Danger  style  power pop  that\u2019s already been done to death. Turn the guitars way up and turn the creativity way down. What you\u2019re left with is a weak collection of songs that are listenable, but bland. This particular collection is from a band called Lit, and it\u2019s called A Place In The Sun (RCA).\" Katz continued, \"The aforementioned one hit on the album is 'My Own Worst Enemy. A week earlier, Katz wrote that \"My Own Worst Enemy\" \"is a great song because of its simplicity and short duration\". According to Liz Tracy of the  New Times Broward-Palm Beach , My Own Worst Enemy' was so incredibly radio-friendly that it was hard not to get sucked into that punchy tune and sort of pathetic lyrics\".\nThe compilation  Punk Goes Pop 4 , one of many albums in the  Punk Goes...  series, \"features some of the hottest pop songs in music today being performed by various metalcore, post-hardcore and electronicore artists.\" Altsounds, an independent music journal, noted that there has been a \"sudden rise in the amount of bands combining electronic and metal styles of music.\" The article noted that many of the bands who created cover songs for Punk Goes Pop 4 incorporated characteristics of electronicore, specifically referencing  I See Stars  and  Woe, Is Me .\nWhile emo originated in  hardcore punk  and has been considered a subgenre of  post-hardcore , it has also been associated with  indie rock  and  pop punk . The fusion of emo with pop punk is also known as  emo pop . According to  AllMusic , \"some emo leans toward the  progressive  side, full of complex guitar work, unorthodox song structures, arty noise, and extreme dynamic shifts; some emo is much closer to punk-pop, though it's a bit more intricate\". Lyrics, which are a key focus in the genre, are typically emotional and often personal, dealing with topics such as failed romance; AllMusic described emo lyrics as \"usually either free-associative poetry or intimate confessionals\". According to AllMusic, early emo bands were hardcore bands that \"favored expressive vocals over the typical barking rants\" of regular hardcore and most 1990s emo bands \"borrowed from some combination of  Fugazi ,  Sunny Day Real Estate , and  Weezer \".  The New York Times  described as emo as \"emotional  punk  or post-hardcore or pop-punk. That is, punk that wears its heart on its sleeve and tries a little tenderness to leaven its sonic attack. If it helps, imagine  Ricky Nelson  singing in the  Sex Pistols .\" Author Matt Diehl described emo as a \"more sensitive interpolation of punk's mission\".\nPop punk typically merges upbeat  pop  melodies with catchy hooks, catchy choruses, harmonies, speedy  tempo s,  punk rock  power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars.  About.com  has described second-wave pop punk bands as having \"a radio friendly sheen to their music, but still maintaining much of the speed and attitude of classic punk rock\". According to The A.V. Club, pop punk often pits \"sweet harmonies against bratty, rowdy riffs\". Lyrical topics that are common in pop punk include love, lust, drunkenness, adolescence, cartoonish violence and drugs. Some pop punk lyrics focus on jokes and humor. Some pop punk music features elements of  power pop ,  emo  or  skate punk .\nAlternative Press  writer Colin McGuire noted that Through Being Cool influenced a new wave of pop-punk bands, such as  Fall Out Boy ,  My Chemical Romance , and  Taking Back Sunday . Alternative Press also included the album on their list of the most influential albums of 1999. Tris McCall of  NJ.com  listed the album as \"every third-wave emo band's inspiration [...] [sending] a shockwave through the pop-punk underground.\"  NME  listed the album was one of 20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic.  BuzzFeed  included it at number 5 on its list of 36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F\u2014\u2014ing Die. The album was included in  Rock Sound s 101 Modern Classics list at number 60, with the notation that \"pop-punk has not been the same since [1999], and this record plays a major role in that change.\" Fall Out Boy vocalist  Patrick Stump  listed the album at number 10 on his list of 10 Records That Changed My Life. Stumped revealed that he wouldn't \"have been in Fall Out Boy if it weren't for this record\". The album's artwork was included by  Fuse.tv  as one of 20 Iconic Pop Punk Album Covers.  Stereogum  listed \"Rocks Tonic Juice Magic\" as one of 30 Essential Songs From The Golden Era of Emo.\nThe Hollywood Reporter  Mischa Pearlman, in a review a 2013 concert by the group, wrote that the song \"visibly infects every member of the audience. Because it's a song that recalls the reckless abandon of youth, and the carelessness of growing up.\" Although the magazine gave the song a scathing review upon its initial release,  NME placed it at number 117 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\" nearly thirteen years later, writing, \"Few songs capture the urge of wanting to act stupid and be immature as well as this 2000 single does. [...] This is everything pop punk does well. Its guitar riffs seem to have been soaked in Relentless and its chorus makes you want to jump around the room. It's been imitated thousands of times since, but nothing's come close to this...\"\nEmo pop (short for emo pop punk) is a  fusion genre  that combines elements of  emo  with  pop punk  influences, such as more concise songs and  hook -filled  chorus es.\nFix Me  has been described as  hard rock  and  pop punk .  Masterpiece Theatre  has been described as pop punk and  symphonic rock .  Ever After  has been described as pop punk and symphonic rock.  Astoria  has been described as  funk ,  pop , and pop punk.\nThe record proved very influential on the  pop punk  genre. With the release of the record, Blink-182 became celebrities and the biggest pop punk act of the era. The glossy production instantly set Blink-182 apart from the other crossover punk acts, such as Green Day. Scott Russo of  Unwritten Law  remarked that he would receive CDs from fans that mimicked the \"pop punk\" sound the album made famous. \"It was revolutionary, it was equally as revolutionary as Green Day when it hit, they just didn't get the credit,\" Russo remarked in 2009. Matt Diehl, author of My So-Called Punk, writes that mainstream acolytes of their sound led to profound effects on the \"pop punk\" genre, such as the deracination of regional scene identity\u2014due to its wide popularity, pop punk bands became commonplace outside its origins. Jon Blisten of  Beats Per Minute  writes that \"Enema success perpetuated pop-punk\u2019s viability on mainstream radio, which is where Blink\u2019s progeny \u2014 bands like  Fall Out Boy ,  Simple Plan , and  New Found Glory  \u2014 would receive a decent amount of airplay.\"  Rolling Stone  Nicole Frehs\u00e9e wrote that the album influenced  emo  fans, while  MTV News  credited the album, alongside  The Get Up Kids '  Something to Write Home About  (1999) as pioneering  emo pop , calling them \"some of the scene\u2019s most influential records.\"\nBleached are an American  punk rock  and  pop punk  band consisting of sisters Jennifer Clavin and Jessica Clavin, formerly of  Mika Miko , and Micayla Grace formerly of a Leopold & His Fiction. The band plays a style of punk rock, pop punk,  alternative rock ,  rock and roll ,  indie pop ,  indie rock , and  pop rock  music. Bleached was established in  Los Angeles ,  California  in 2011. The group have released two  studio album s, Ride Your Heart (2013) and Welcome the Worms (2016), both with  Dead Oceans , and charting on the  Billboard magazine  charts.\nPunk rock continued to be popular in the 1990s with the appearance the bands  Atheist Rap  and  Zbogom Brus Li  from  Novi Sad ,  Goblini  from  \u0160abac ,  D\u017eukele  from  Subotica  and  Novembar  from  Ni\u0161 . Atheist Rap's sound, a combination of punk rock with humorous lyrics found on their studio albums  Maori i Crni Gonzales  (1992),  Ja eventualno bih ako njega elimini\u0161ete  (1996) and  II liga zapad  (1998), was described by the band themselves as \"happy punk\". Zbogom Brus Li combined punk rock and  folk music  of  Vojvodina  into a style the band describes as \"tambura\u0161ki punk\" (\" tamburitza  punk\") on their albums Penk Punk Pink Pank Ponk (1995) and Zlobro (1997). The band Goblini was formed in 1992, and with the release of their first two studio albums,  Goblini  (1994) and  Istinite pri\u010de I deo  (1994), the band had become a live attraction, performing in Serbia and abroad. On their third studio album  U magnovenju  (1996), the band was joined by  Leonid Pilipovi\u0107  from the band D\u017eukele. After the album release, Pilipovi\u0107 returned to his own band, which, having released their debut  Gledaju\u0107i u mrak  in 1994 and the second album  Zubato Sunce  in 1998, disbanded. Punk rock band Novembar released three studio albums, Deguelo (1994), Blues ju\u017ene pruge (1997), and Licem prema zemlji in (2000) featuring the band's combination of  America n guitar oriented rock sound combined with punk rock,  pop punk  and  new wave  influences.\nIt is not clear when the term \"pop punk\" was first used, but pop-influenced punk rock had been around since the mid to late 1970s.  Protopunk  and  power pop  bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s helped lay the groundwork for the pop punk sound, which emerged at the onset of  punk rock  around 1974 with the  Ramones .  The Beatles ,  the Kinks  and  the Beach Boys  all paved the way for pop punk. With their love of  the Beach Boys  and late 1960s  bubblegum pop , the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. The Ramones' loud and fast melodic minimalism differentiated them from other bands in New York City's budding  art rock  scene, but pop punk was not considered a separate subgenre until later. An early use of the term \"pop punk\" appeared in a 1977  New York Times  article, \"Cabaret:  Tom Petty 's Pop Punk Rock Evokes Sounds of 60s\".\nThe band's style is mainly  skate punk  and  punk rock . Originally a punk rock band, by the rise of popularity of  pop punk  in the late 1990s and early 2000s the group leaned more towards a more pop punk sound. Albums like  The Ever Passing Moment  and  Before Everything and After  were criticized by some fans for its pop punk style. The group's 2005 album  Panic  returned to the band's roots.\nEvan Lucy of  Alternative Press  gave a mixed review of the album, feeling \"some songs feel ripped from Fall Out Boy's  Take This to Your Grave ,\" but praised songs which were less adherent to pop punk, namely \"Tigers and Sharks\" and \"Always Attract\".  AllMusic  reviewer Jon O'Brien criticised the album's sound, describing it as \"a potential stop-gap for those who feel like they've grown out of the schoolboy pop-punk of  Busted  but aren't quite ready yet to embrace the  post-hardcore  of  Fightstar ,\" complaining that the band followed a \"well-worn formula\" of  emo pop . However, AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier later regarded Take Off Your Colours as an \"impressive debut album\" which cemented the group \"as one of England's hottest up-and-coming rock bands\".\nPortman's musical style is generally characterized as  pop punk , heavily influenced by the  Ramones  and other melodic rock groups. This is the style most generally associated with The Mr. T Experience. His compositions cover a variety of topics but are concerned primarily with personal relationships; he is known to introduce much of his material with the throwaway line \"This is a song about a girl.\" Over the years his other musical tastes and interests have pushed the band to explore many styles, branching out from the Bay Area pop punk sound which he helped define. This change is evidenced on a number of solo acoustic songs interspersed between the pop punk standards on most of the band's late-1990s albums. Portman's solo recordings have further explored these other styles and influences, including  country ,  bossa nova ,  Rock & Roll , and 1960s  beat music .\nEnglish electropop singer  Little Boots  recorded a  cover version  of \"See You Again\" that surfaced the Internet in December 2008. In an interview with  Digital Spy , Little Boots said, \"That's a wicked song! The line 'My best friend Lesley said, \"Oh she's just being Miley\"' is awesome. Me and my friend have been obsessing over that lyrics for ages now, it's getting ridiculous!\"  Breathe Carolina 's act consisted of a balance of  pop punk  and  rock music , which stood out to their record label,  Fearless Records . Because of it, Fearless Records decided to reserve a spot for them on their upcoming compilation  Punk Goes Pop 2  (2009), where they performed a cover version of \"See You Again\", produced by Mike Green. Breathe Carolina included their version of \"See You Again\" in their set list for the  Warped Tour 2009 . The cover later appeared on the deluxe edition of the band's second studio album  Hello Fascination  (2010).\nThe popular music scene at the time included such teen-pop bands as the Allies (whose song \"Emma Peel\" received a good deal of local play, but never broke out nationally) and the Heaters (later \"the Heats\"). That same era saw the more sophisticated pop of the short-lived Visible Targets and the still-performing  Young Fresh Fellows  and  The Posies ; the pop-punk of  The Fastbacks ; and the outright punk of  the Fartz  (later Ten Minute Warning).\nAfter the breakthrough of  punk rock  in the 1990s, by the 2000s the genre had evolved more into  pop punk  due to major label records taking interest and signing on bands such as  Blink-182 .  Green Day  kick-started the 2000s with the release of their sixth studio album  Warning  in 2000 to lukewarm success. The following year,  Blink-182  released their fourth studio album  Take Off Your Pants And Jacket  in 2001 which went on to sell 14 million copies worldwide. It was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number one on the  Billboard 200  within its first week of release and securing the status of the pop punk trio as one of biggest bands of the genre.  Also in that year,  Canadian  band Sum 41 released their debut album  All Killer, No Filler , which went platinum in the United States. The second-wave bands dominated the pop punk genre in the early years with bands like  Good Charlotte ,  New Found Glory ,  Simple Plan  and  Sum 41  receiving platinum status and gaining a large fan bases worldwide. In 2002,  Avril Lavigne  became popular in the  pop punk  scene thanks to her pop punk based sound, and was arguably the most prominent artist to take this new direction in pop music, with hits such as \" Complicated \" and \" Sk8er Boi \". In 2003,  Blink-182  released their untitled album  blink-182 , which demonstrated a darker and more mature tone than previous albums. This was mainly due to the side-project  Box Car Racer . Even so, the album was yet another commercial and critical success. It was to be their last album released before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2005. The band would reunite four years later. After their 1994 breakthrough,  Green Day 's fame was fading, mainly due to rising popularity of other bands like  Good Charlotte  and  Sum 41 . Realising this, they retreated to the studio and produced their seventh studio album  American Idiot  released in 2004. It saw a significant sales boost, selling 14 million copies worldwide.  Fall Out Boy 's  From Under The Cork Tree  gained commercial success in 2005 and put the band on the pop punk map. The last successful pop punk album of the decade was  Green Day 's eighth studio album  21st Century Breakdown  released in 2009 which achieved their best chart performance to date by reaching number one on the album charts of various countries, including the  United States   Billboard 200 , the  European Top 100 Albums , and the  United Kingdom Albums Chart .\nIn the early 2000s, there was an astounding resurgence of interest in  pop rock  and  power pop . This was kickstarted in the year 2000 with the success of  Blink-182 's song \" All the Small Things \" and  Nine Days 's song \" Absolutely (Story of a Girl) \", both of which peaked at #6 on the  Billboard Hot 100 . The trend kicked off the brief musical careers of  Ryan Cabrera ,  Ashley Parker Angel ,  Teddy Geiger ,  Evan and Jaron ,  The Click Five ,  Jet , and  Snow Patrol throughout the early and mid 2000s. This also paved the way for a second wave of  pop punk  bands such as  Good Charlotte ,  New Found Glory , and  Sum 41 , who made use of humor in their videos and had a radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, attitude and even the look of 1970s punk. Later pop-punk bands such as  Simple Plan ,  The All-American Rejects  and  Fall Out Boy  had a sound that had been described as closer to late 1970s and early 1980s hardcore, with similarities to the band  Cheap Trick , while still achieving considerable commercial success. In addition, some of the most successful pop-punk bands of the 1990s, such as  Green Day ,  Blink-182 ,  Weezer  and  The Offspring  continued their success during the early 2000s.\nThe origins of 1990s punk pop can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like  The Buzzcocks  and  The Clash , commercially successful new wave acts such as  The Jam  and  The Undertones , and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s. Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars. Punk music provided the inspiration for some California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including  Rancid ,  Pennywise ,  Weezer  and  Green Day . In 1994 Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album  Dookie , which found a new, largely teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including two number ones in the US. They were soon followed by the eponymous d\u00e9but from Weezer, which spawned three top ten singles in the US. This success opened the door for the multi-platinum sales of metallic punk band  The Offspring  with  Smash  (1994). This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day's  Nimrod  (1997) and The Offspring's  Americana  (1998).\nThe fifth song on the album, \"Rylo Ken\", is an acoustic track which, lyrically, incorporates references to the character of \"Kylo Ren\", an antagonist from the 2015 film  Star Wars: The Force Awakens , into the angst-ridden, rebellious lyrics of many pop punk songs. Alonge has expressed on multiple occasions that he is an avid fan of the Star Wars series. The sixth track on the album, \"Trigger Warning\", satirizes the  social justice warrior  subculture frequently ridiculed on the Internet. While the song is primarily pop punk, the song's upbeat tone drastically changes as a  metalcore  and  deathcore -influenced section makes up the second half of the song.\nPignoise is described as a  pop punk  band. Even though they have been seen wearing  NOFX  shirts in music videos, their light  punk rock  characteristics and their predominant  pop music  sound makes them clearly a  pop punk  band. They may also be considered  pop rock . The band cites  blink-182 ,  Green Day  or  The Offspring  as some of their main influences.\nTim Cashmere of Undercover News reviewed their debut album, Standing Still (2003); he described them as a \"Christian-punk act\" and felt the album was \"none-too-shabby, albeit none-too-original either... The god-fearing punk beats of Wishful Thinking makes an interesting point of difference.\" Ben Seifu of vibewire.net noticed that \"the production is quite professional without being too smooth or processed. The drums in particular are captured reasonably well. But beyond that Standing Still is pretty standard pop punk stuff.\" Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project opined that it \"oozes of punk pop goodness that echoes heroes of said genre such as MXPX. The band's strength lies in their combination of consistent punk power chords with a lyrical depth underpinning their spiritual beliefs.\"\nDan Bennett claims the progression is also called the \"pop-punk progression\" because of its frequent use in  pop punk .\n\"Bang Bang Sexy\" is a song written, composed and performed by  Short Stack , an Australian  pop punk  band from  Budgewoi . This song is from their third album,  Art Vandelay .\n\"Adam's Song\" was a departure from the content of the band's previous singles, in favor of a slower tempo and more depressing lyrics. Brian Wallace of  MTV  wrote that Blink-182 \"explores new ground on \u201cAdam\u2019s Song,\u201d setting aside their normal pop-punk punch for a more  emo -influenced approach.\" The song is a  pop punk  and  alternative rock  track composed in the  key  of  C major  and is set in  time signature  of  common time  with a  tempo  of 136  beats per minute . Hoppus' vocal range spans from G to G.\nThe song proved influential on the  pop punk  genre, with a host of young musicians emulating its sound. \"It blended punk attitude with pop songwriting so much better than other bands,\" said  Simple Plan  bassist  David Desrosiers .\nPop punk (also known as punk pop and other names) is a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with  pop music , to varying degrees. It is not clear when the term pop punk was first used, but pop-influenced punk rock had been around since the mid- to late-1970s. Examples of commercially successful pop punk bands include  Green Day ,  the Offspring ,  Blink-182 ,  Sum 41 ,  My Chemical Romance  and  Simple Plan .\nEmo pop was influenced by  emo  and  pop punk . Bands such as  The Wrens ,  Weezer ,  Sense Field  and  Jawbreaker  were emo bands who influenced and set the blueprints for the emo pop genre.  The Get Up Kids  even made a major emo pop album called  Something to Write Home About . They also influenced many newer emo pop bands like  Fall Out Boy  who were also influenced by bands like  New Found Glory ,  Green Day ,  Screeching Weasel ,  Lifetime ,  Earth Crisis ,  Gorilla Biscuits  and  The Ramones . Pop punk band  Blink-182  have been a very big influence on emo pop. The new generation of pop punk, emo pop and alternative rock fans view the Blink-182 sound as \"hugely influential,\" with even Montgomery writing, \"... without them, there'd be no Fall Out Boy, no  Paramore , or no  Fueled by Ramen Records .\" The  emo / punk rock  band Jawbreaker has influenced bands like  Fall Out Boy  and  My Chemical Romance .\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave  punk rock  bands such as the  Ramones ,  The Clash ,  Sex Pistols ,  The Jam , and the  Buzzcocks . Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock,  pop punk  and  alternative rock .  Stephen Thomas Erlewine  of  AllMusic  described Green Day as \" punk revival ists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands  H\u00fcsker D\u00fc  and  The Replacements , and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's \" Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely \" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in the group's song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited  The Kinks ,  The Who  and  power pop  pioneers  Cheap Trick . English rock musician  Noel Gallagher  of  Oasis  complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song \" Wonderwall \" with its song \" Boulevard of Broken Dreams \".\nForever the Sickest Kids' main genres consist of  pop punk ,  pop rock , and  power pop . Many of the band's songs feature  synthesizer s and have  dance  and  electronic  based influences, along with the  piano  and  keyboard  often being included.  Acoustic  and  hip hop  have also been utilized in the group's music. The band mainly has positive, upbeat sounds in its songs, which are typically structured with  pop  based hooks, both electronic and regular drum beats, and catchy guitar  riff s that still maintain  rock  and  punk  elements to the music. A primary example that displays the band's structure, sound, and vocal arrangement is the song \"I Don't Know About You, But I Came to Dance\", found on the band's first release, Television Off, Party On.\nThe Wonder Years has been described as  pop punk .  Get Stoked on It!  has been described as pop punk.  The Upsides  has been described as  emo pop  and pop punk.  Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing  has been described as  melodic hardcore  and pop punk.  The Greatest Generation  has been described as pop punk.  No Closer to Heaven  has been described as  alternative rock  and pop punk.\nSome rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band  Dropkick Murphys . In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional  Celtic music , including mandolin,  tin whistle , and  Great Highland bagpipes . The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991  R.E.M.  hit \" Losing My Religion \" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist  Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts),  Luther Dickinson  of  North Mississippi Allstars  and  the Black Crowes  has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\"  Armenian American  rock group  System of A Down  makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album  Mezmerize / Hypnotize .  Pop punk  band  Green Day  has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album,  Warning .  Boyd Tinsley , violin player of the  Dave Matthews Band  has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman  Colin Meloy  and guitarist  Chris Funk  of  the Decemberists  regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music.  Nancy Wilson , rhythm guitarist of  Heart , uses a mandolin in Heart's song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album  Little Queen , as well as in Heart's cover of  Led Zeppelin 's song \" The Battle of Evermore .\" \"Show Me Heaven\" by  Maria McKee , the theme song to the film  Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin. The popular alt rock group  Imagine Dragons  feature the mandolin on a few of their songs, most prominently being \" It's Time \". Folk rock band  the Lumineers  use a mandolin in the background of their 2012 hit \" Ho Hey \".\nThe Violets were a  post punk / indie / pop  band from the  New Cross  area of  London . Formed initially as a bassless garage punk trio, The Violets early gigs saw them playing stark, spiky and minimalist punk that evoked early art-school punk bands such as  Delta 5 ,  Prag Vec , and  Siouxsie and the Banshees , as well as more contemporary acts such as  Yeah Yeah Yeahs .\nEven though their main musical style is never revealed in the show, it is presumed that their main genres are  power pop  (as evidenced in the song \"The Girl Next Door\"),  alternative rock  (as evidenced in the song \"Hollywood Girl\"),  pop rock  (as evidenced in the song \"Makes Me Happy\"),  blues rock  (as evidenced in \"Old, Cranky Josh\"),  pop punk  (as evidenced in the song \"I Found a Way\"), and  post-grunge  (as evidenced in the song \"Don't Preach\"). Possible influences for the band are  Sparks  (mentioned frequently in the series),  Zero Gravity , and  Aerosmith  (the  Just Push Play  album sleeve is seen frequently in the series).\n\"Makes No Sense At All\" is a song by  H\u00fcsker D\u00fc  from the album  Flip Your Wig . The song was the only  single  from the album. The release of the single, along with the flip side track \"Love Is All Around\"\u2014the theme song to  The Mary Tyler Moore Show \u2014demonstrated H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's continued move away from their  hardcore punk  roots to a more melodic synthesis of pop and punk.\nThe second and ninth tracks on the album, \"The Catchy One\" and \"Nothing Special\", satirize the generic lyrical themes and song structures commonly found in local, unsigned pop punk bands. \"Nothing Special\" in particular makes references to the diminished creative efforts that usually tend to occur in \"filler\" songs towards the end of albums, with less time and resources being allocated to said songs. The final track on the album, \"Mother's Milk\", is lyrically described as addressing the issue of growing up, a common theme in pop-punk music.\nPop-influenced punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s with a music style that was stylistically similar to  power pop . By the mid-1980s, several bands merged  hardcore punk  with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as  Dag Nasty ,  the Nip Drivers ,  T.S.O.L. ,  Social Distortion , and the  Descendents . Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid to late 1980s. Pop punk particularly  thrived in California , where  independent record label s adopted a  do it yourself  (DIY) approach to releasing music. By the mid 1990s, a few pop punk bands had started to sell millions of records and receive extensive radio and television airplay, such as  Green Day . By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of  Blink-182 's  Enema of the State , represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s. In the mid-2000s,  emo pop , a fusion genre combining  emo  and pop punk, became popular. By the end of the 2000s, the pop punk sound of the 1990s had largely waned in mainstream popularity.\nThe band's style has been disputed by fans because of the complex combination of different musical styles and the more mature, serious, and heavy sound in later albums. The band's EP  Half Hour of Power  is described as punk rock, skate punk and pop punk.  All Killer, No Filler  was described as pop punk and skate punk. Does This Look Infected? has been described as punk rock, pop punk and  melodic hardcore . Chuck was getting heavier opting out the original pop punk sound with strong metal influences and an alternative rock sound, but the band kept in touch with its punk rock and melodic hardcore roots, which created an even more mature side than the group's previous effort. Critics have described Underclass Hero as a revival of the band's pop punk style. Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; \"The Jester\" is an \"anti-Bush screed\", \"Underclass Hero\" is a song about class struggle, and \"Dear Father\" is about Deryck's absent father. The band's next effort,  Screaming Bloody Murder , marks a return to the direction of Chuck, with songs such as the title track or the Grammy-nominated Blood in my Eyes featuring heavier guitar riffs. Opposite to the heavier direction, there are also tracks such as the second single Baby You Don't Wanna Know whose style leans more towards a garage rock approach. The album furthermore features more experimental song structures, mostly evident in the piece A Dark Road Out Of Hell consisting of three tracks of the record.\n\"What's My Age Again?\" is a song by American  rock  band  Blink-182 . It was released in April 1999 as the  lead single  from the group's third studio album,  Enema of the State  (1999). The song, written primarily by bassist and vocalist  Mark Hoppus , lyrically revolves around the onset of age and maturity, and the lack of implementing changes in behavior. A mid-tempo  pop punk  song, it was written by Hoppus based on personal experience. It was originally titled \" Peter Pan Complex \", an allusion to the  pop-psychology  concept, but  MCA Records  forced the band to retitle the song, as the label found it too obscure a reference. It was the first Blink-182 single to feature drummer  Travis Barker .\nOverall, Breakout is dominant on  pop rock  but explores a variety of other musical genres. The opening track, \"Breakout\", is a  dance-pop  number that begins with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progresses to \"the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer\"; \"ecstatic beats\" pummel throughout. The song's lyrics are \"a girls-only call to fun\" that anecdote on feelings about coming of age and the desire to be school-free. The uptempo refrains of \"7 Things\" are  pop punk  influenced. The song is \"a three- tempo  patchwork quilt\", transitioning \"from sensitive breakup song in the strummy verses to punky-pop kiss-off in the double-time choruses.\" \"7 Things\"' lyrics list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend. \"The Driveway\" is a  power ballad  whose lyrics regard a breakup, insisting \"nothing hurts like losing when you know it's really gone.\" The cover of Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" replaces the subtle  reggae  undercurrent in the original version with a more rock music driven sound that includes pop punk beats and string stabs. The lyrics of \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" primarily discuss the \"desire to let loose with one's friends\", touching upon details of the life of an overworked child star. The song \"Full Circle\" is composed of a several pop rock  hook s; in one of the hooks, Cyrus finishes various words with \"Oh, oh, oh!\". The lyrics describe not quitting a relationship.\nGuitarist Neil Westfall said in a 2010 interview with Alter the Press!: \"We've written a few jams, we're always constantly writing, like I think we wrote some parts the other day.\" Westfall also said once the band return home from touring, they were \"going to drop everything and start writing and doing pre-production full time.\" At this point, the band had ten songs and were trying to condense them into five, then planning to write five more. Westfall said the band completed the final \"few songs when we were back home with Tom (Denney) and Chad (Gilbert).\" On the pace of writing, McKinnon said: \"It seems like a really fast thing that has happened but we've been constantly working on it the entire time.\" On the songs themselves, he said: \"the pop-punk stuff has a darker edge to it. I wrote it like that, it's still pop-punk but with a darker edge\". The album was influenced by  Finch 's  What It Is to Burn  (2002). The album \"came together song by song\" as McKinnon mentioned, with the band coming up with 15\u201316 song ideas. McKinnon stated in an interview with  Rocksound  that there's songs \"that didn't make this record that we're saving.\" There is a track on the album that was previously written for Homesick.\nWith their love of  the Beach Boys  and late 1960s  bubblegum pop , the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as  Buzzcocks  and  the Undertones  combined  pop -style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist  Ben Myers ,  Bad Religion  \"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\";  Descendents  \"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys\u2013inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\".  Epitaph Records , founded by  Brett Gurewitz  of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as  the Queers  and  Screeching Weasel , began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like  Green Day  and  the Offspring , who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as  the Vandals  and  Guttermouth  developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like  Dillinger Four  who would talk a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as  Blink-182  is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"\nUnlike previous albums by the band, Modern makes prominent use of numerous  electronic  instruments and drum machines, particularly on Steve Diggle's material, although Shelley's songs are more akin to the band's usual \"catchy, tightly written punk and pop songs.\" Michael Sandlin of  Pitchfork  saw it as an attempt from the band to sound \"current\" and compared its programmed drums and \"sputtering synth blips\" to  techno . Shelley said that the band were \"trying not to make a rock album. So, instead of trying to make it sound like we were a rock band, we tried a more studio based approach. And, more control over what was going on. Also, we felt uncomfortable with trying to be a rock band, when everybody's trying to be one. We though, why bother...be more modern.\" Ear Candy Mag told him that Modern \"is contemporary, but it is definitely Buzzcocks,\" noting that his \"voice is very distinctive.\" Antek Gun of Ox Fanzine said that instead of being a punk rock album, Modern sees the band \"work with strange, rapidly alternating sounds, sizzling guitars, synthesizers from a forgotten time.\" However, Wilson Neate of Westnet played down the electronic influence of the album, saying that the album continues the \"pretty much\" same approach as the band's 1970s albums: \"short, sharp-edged, anxious and angst ridden, irritable and irritated  punk pop .\n...Is a Real Boy has received almost universally positive reviews from music critics.  AbsolutePunk.net  reviewer Jason Tate awarded the album a 99% rating and praised the band's writing, saying \"By the second song it is perceptible that the band has a grasp on crafting songs that do not follow a formula, or insult the listener by maintaining a hold on one particular style or sound.\"  Allmusic 's Corey Apar also gave the album a glowing review, writing \"...Is a Real Boy comes off as an impressively well-done, multifaceted effort that deserves multiple spins and makes Say Anything truly a band to watch.\"  Punk News  noted that the album seems to be commenting in the over-use of  irony  in the  emo   scene , writing \"Yes, this album is highly ironic in that it's critical of the scene it's categorized in and it's an album about a band and there are songs in here that are about songs. But, Bemis's overall quirkiness makes it work.\"  Entertainment Weekly  wrote that, \"Say Anything, an emo act based in L.A., has a new disc that proves that the genre can be artful and intriguing.\"  BuzzFeed  included the album at number 19 on their \"36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F\u2014\u2014ing Die\" list.\nPerhaps the most important change in the 1990s in American popular music was the rise of  alternative rock  through the popularity of  grunge . This was previously an explicitly anti-mainstream grouping of genres that rose to great fame beginning in the early 1990s. The genre in its early stages was largely situated on  Sub Pop Records , a company founded by  Bruce Pavitt and John Poneman . Significant grunge bands signed to the label were  Green River  (half of the members from this band would later become founding members of  Pearl Jam ),  Sonic Youth  (although not a grunge band they were influential on grunge bands and in fact it was upon the insistence of  Kim Gordon  that the  David Geffen Company  signed  Nirvana ) and Nirvana. Grunge is an alternative rock subgenre with a \"dark, brooding guitar-based sludge\" sound, drawing on heavy metal, punk, and elements of bands like Sonic Youth and their use of \"unconventional tunings to bend otherwise standard pop songs completely out of shape.\" With the addition of a \"melodic, Beatlesque element\" to the sound of bands like Nirvana, grunge became wildly popular across the United States. Grunge became commercially successful in the early 1990s, peaking between 1991 and 1994. Bands from cities in the U.S.  Pacific Northwest  especially  Seattle ,  Washington , were responsible for creating grunge and later made it popular with mainstream audiences. The supposed  Generation X , who had just reached adulthood as grunge's popularity peaked, were closely associated with grunge, the sound which helped \"define the desperation of (that) generation.\" Later Post Grunge bands such as  Foo Fighters  and  Creed  became popular form of Alternative rock because it was and still is very radio friendly unlike the Grunge band of which they were musically influenced by.  Pop punk  bands like  Green Day  and  Blink 182  also gained popularity. In the second half of the 1990s  nu metal  arose with bands such as  Linkin Park ,  Korn ,  Limp Bizkit  and  Slipknot . The independent culture slumbered in the underground scenes with new genres such as  lo-fi  ( Beck ,  Sparklehorse ,  Guided By Voices ),  math rock  ( Slint ,  Shellac ) and  post-rock  ( Mogwai ,  Explosions in the Sky ).  Emocore  and  Post-hardcore  became more known with bands such as  At the Drive-In  and  Fugazi .\nA Short Collection of Short Songs is an EP by  Ohio  based  Pop Punk  band  Mixtapes (band) . It is literally a short collection of 6 short songs.\n\"Pop Punk Pizza Party\" by Sunrise Skater Kids embodies many well-known stereotypes and characteristics surrounding  pop punk  subcultures, such as the love of pizza, glorification of friendship, and desires to leave home and tour. A demo version of the song was released in mid-2014, and it was professionally re-recorded for the album.\nThe Prozacs play a fast, short, high energy,and bratty style of Pop-Punk. They have often been compared to Early 90s Pop-Punk bands like  Screeching Weasel  and  The Queers . They've also often been compared to  The Ramones .Their songs are full of harmonies and sing along choruses. They often sing about love, being fed-up, friendship, punk rock shows, and their hatred of Emo.\nMan Overboard received favourable reviews.  AllMusic  reviewer William Ruhlmann opened his review with mentioning how the group released several releases in the preceding 18 months. Calling this decision \"indicative of Man Overboard's youthful drive; this is a band that is in a hurry.\" This \"rush\" was \"expressed in the breakneck tempos of the short (none over three and a half minutes) songs\" on the group's self-titled album. Ruhlmann classified the album's sound as being \"standard-issue\"  pop punk  in the vein of  Green Day  and  Blink-182 , with \"an echo\" of  Jimmy Eat World , in terms of the \"contrasting vocals\" of Bruzzese and Eisenstein. Kaj Roth of  Melodic  noted that how Man Overboard's name was taken from the Blink-182  song of the same name , \"it makes sense when I listen to their new album which is a major flirt with B812's early sound\". He went on further to say \"this is pop punk how it sounded back around 1999-2002 with faster songs and more focus on punk rock than pop.\" Roth closed with calling the release \"a solid album\". Writing for  Rock Sound , Andy Ritchie wrote that the album \"reveals little reinvention, but the nuts and bolts of what makes them so affable have only been tightened and polished further\". He considered the band as having \"a formula that just works\", concluding with: \"there really isn\u2019t a dud track here.\"\nPop punk generally waned in mainstream popularity by the late 2000s. The genre has fallen out of mainstream radio success, with rock bands and guitars becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio. While  Blink-182  and  Green Day  continue to headline arenas and sell out their concerts, others, such as  New Found Glory  and  Yellowcard , have seen attendance decrease steadily. Devon Maloney of  MTV  wrote that \"Pop punk and emo bands don\u2019t headline  Coachella  or  Bonnaroo ; they rarely, if ever, are even billed on mainstream festival stages,\" and notes that it has similarly disappeared from the press. The only magazines that feature pop punk bands are niche publications like  Alternative Press  (AP) and the occasional teen magazine, while influential pop punk magazine AMP ceased publication in 2013.\nPunk rock is a rock music genre that developed in the mid-1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as proto-punk music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically produced short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics.

Pop music is a genre of popular music which originated in its modern form in the 1950s, deriving from rock and roll. The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, even though the former is a description of music which is popular while the latter is a specific genre containing qualities of mass appeal.\nPop Punk.
