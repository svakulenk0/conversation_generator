Green Day  kick-started the 2000s with the release of their sixth studio album  Warning  in 2000 to lukewarm success. The following year,  Blink-182  released their fourth studio album  Take Off Your Pants And Jacket  in 2001 which went on to sell 14 million copies worldwide. It was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number one on the  Billboard 200  within its first week of release and securing the status of the pop punk trio as one of biggest bands of the genre.  Also in that year,  Canadian  band Sum 41 released their debut album  All Killer, No Filler, which went platinum in the United States. The second-wave bands dominated the pop punk genre in the early years with bands like  Good Charlotte,  New Found Glory,  Simple Plan  and  Sum 41  receiving platinum status and gaining a large fan bases worldwide. In 2002,  Avril Lavigne  became popular in the  pop punk  scene thanks to her pop punk based sound, and was arguably the most prominent artist to take this new direction in pop music, with hits such as \" Complicated \" and \" Sk8er Boi \". In 2003,  Blink-182  released their untitled album  blink-182, which demonstrated a darker and more mature tone than previous albums. This was mainly due to the side-project  Box Car Racer. Even so, the album was yet another commercial and critical success. It was to be their last album released before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2005. The band would reunite four years later. After their 1994 breakthrough,  Green Day's fame was fading, mainly due to rising popularity of other bands like  Good Charlotte  and  Sum 41. Realising this, they retreated to the studio and produced their seventh studio album  American Idiot  released in 2004. It saw a significant sales boost, selling 14 million copies worldwide.  Fall Out Boy's  From Under The Cork Tree  gained commercial success in 2005 and put the band on the pop punk map. The last successful pop punk album of the decade was  Green Day's eighth studio album  21st Century Breakdown  released in 2009 which achieved their best chart performance to date by reaching number one on the album charts of various countries, including the  United States   Billboard 200, the  European Top 100 Albums, and the  United Kingdom Albums Chart.", "qas": [{"id": "question_950", "question": "What is the next step", "answers": [{"text": "After the breakthrough of  punk rock  in the 1990s, by the 2000s the genre had evolved more into  pop punk  ", "answer_start": 0}], "class": "general", "algorithm": "general_sent", "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "question_951", "question": "Why did they leave?", "answers": [{"text": "due to major label records taking interest and signing on bands such as  Blink-182.

One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band  Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional  Celtic music, including mandolin,  tin whistle, and  Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991  R.E.M.  hit \" Losing My Religion \" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist  Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts),  Luther Dickinson  of  North Mississippi Allstars  and  the Black Crowes  has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\"  Armenian American  rock group  System of A Down  makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album  Mezmerize / Hypnotize.  Pop punk  band  Green Day  has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album,  Warning.  Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the  Dave Matthews Band  has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman  Colin Meloy  and guitarist  Chris Funk  of  the Decemberists  regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music.

Does This Look Infected? has been described as punk rock, pop punk and  melodic hardcore. Chuck was getting heavier opting out the original pop punk sound with strong metal influences and an alternative rock sound, but the band kept in touch with its punk rock and melodic hardcore roots, which created an even more mature side than the group's previous effort. Critics have described Underclass Hero as a revival of the band's pop punk style. Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; \"The Jester\" is an \"anti-Bush screed\", \"Underclass Hero\" is a song about class struggle, and \"Dear Father\" is about Deryck's absent father. The band's next effort,  Screaming Bloody Murder, marks a return to the direction of Chuck, with songs such as the title track or the Grammy-nominated Blood in my Eyes featuring heavier guitar riffs.

In the late 1970s, UK bands such as  Buzzcocks  and  the Undertones  combined  pop -style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist  Ben Myers,  Bad Religion  \"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\";  Descendents  \"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys\u2013inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\".  Epitaph Records, founded by  Brett Gurewitz  of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as  the Queers  and  Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like  Green Day  and  the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as  the Vandals  and  Guttermouth  developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics.

1990s in American popular music was the rise of  alternative rock  through the popularity of  grunge. This was previously an explicitly anti-mainstream grouping of genres that rose to great fame beginning in the early 1990s. The genre in its early stages was largely situated on  Sub Pop Records, a company founded by  Bruce Pavitt and John Poneman. Significant grunge bands signed to the label were  Green River  (half of the members from this band would later become founding members of  Pearl Jam ),  Sonic Youth  (although not a grunge band they were influential on grunge bands and in fact it was upon the insistence of  Kim Gordon  that the  David Geffen Company  signed  Nirvana ) and Nirvana. Grunge is an alternative rock subgenre with a \"dark, brooding guitar-based sludge\" sound, drawing on heavy metal, punk, and elements of bands like Sonic Youth and their use of \"unconventional tunings to bend otherwise standard pop songs completely out of shape.\" With the addition of a \"melodic, Beatlesque element\" to the sound of bands like Nirvana, grunge became wildly popular across the United States. Grunge became commercially successful in the early 1990s, peaking between 1991 and 1994. Bands from cities in the U.S.  Pacific Northwest  especially  Seattle,  Washington, were responsible for creating grunge and later made it popular with mainstream audiences. The supposed  Generation X, who had just reached adulthood as grunge's popularity peaked, were closely associated with grunge, the sound which helped \"define the desperation of (that) generation.\" Later Post Grunge bands such as  Foo Fighters  and  Creed  became popular form of Alternative rock because it was and still is very radio friendly unlike the Grunge band of which they were musically influenced by.  Pop punk  bands like  Green Day  and  Blink 182  also gained popularity. In the second half of the 1990s  nu metal  arose with bands such as  Linkin Park,  Korn,  Limp Bizkit  and  Slipknot. The independent culture slumbered in the underground scenes with new genres such as  lo-fi  ( Beck,  Sparklehorse,  Guided By Voices ),  math rock  ( Slint,  Shellac ) and  post-rock  ( Mogwai,  Explosions in the Sky ).

Ruhlmann classified the album's sound as being \"standard-issue\"  pop punk  in the vein of  Green Day  and  Blink-182, with \"an echo\" of  Jimmy Eat World, in terms of the \"contrasting vocals\" of Bruzzese and Eisenstein. Kaj Roth of  Melodic  noted that how Man Overboard's name was taken from the Blink-182  song of the same name, \"it makes sense when I listen to their new album which is a major flirt with B812's early sound\". He went on further to say \"this is pop punk how it sounded back around 1999-2002 with faster songs and more focus on punk rock than pop.\" Roth closed with calling the release \"a solid album\". Writing for  Rock Sound, Andy Ritchie wrote that the album \"reveals little reinvention, but the nuts and bolts of what makes them so affable have only been tightened and polished further\".
