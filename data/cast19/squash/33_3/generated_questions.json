It covered only the first half of the book, ending at the point where Bastian enters Fantasia (Fantastica).

Since the original speed was unknown this choice was controversial. Known as the \"Moroder version\", it sparked debate among film buffs, with outspoken critics and supporters of the film falling into equal camps. In 1984, Moroder worked with  Philip Oakey  of  The Human League  to make the album  Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder, which was a UK singles chart hit with \" Together in Electric Dreams \", title track to the 1984 film  Electric Dreams.
