The film was originally to be directed by  Wolfgang Petersen  having initially impressed Paramount executives with his family-targeted  The NeverEnding Story . Petersen wanted to film it in his native Germany. The studio decided to settle in the States with an American director and Petersen was not long after commissioned by  20th Century Fox  to take over the production of  Enemy Mine . \"The funny thing about it is that when I was first given the script, I was coming off  Gremlins  and in a rare point in my career I was like 'hey, let's get this guy,'\"  said Dante during a Q&A and screening of the film in 2008. Dante liked what he read but didn't feel there was a third act. \"At the end when the kids went to the planet, they go and play baseball. That was the plot. It seemed that wasn't quite enough.\" While discussing the script with Paramount executives, they said \"we can work on it while we're making the picture.\" Dante and the writer,  Eric Luke , were \"improvising what they were going to do\" while the film was being made.\nThe NeverEnding Story II had a negative critical reception, finding it an inferior sequel. The film has a 0% score on  Rotten Tomatoes  based on six reviews; the average rating is 3.3/10. Richard Harrington of  The Washington Post  wrote, \"Unlike its predecessor, there are few effects in II worthy of being called special, and events unfold with uniform flatness. Silver City feels like Diet Oz, the sorceress's castle is more hinted at than realized and several new creatures are right out of late-night comedy sketches\". Chris Hicks, writing for the  Deseret News , was more kind in his review, writing that it would be enjoyable to children, whereas the first film was enjoyable to the entire family.\nThe NeverEnding Story  was the first film adaptation of the novel. It was released in 1984, directed by  Wolfgang Petersen  and starring  Barret Oliver  as Bastian,  Noah Hathaway  as Atreyu, and  Tami Stronach  as the Childlike Empress. It covered only the first half of the book, ending at the point where Bastian enters Fantasia (Fantastica). Ende, who was reportedly \"revolted\" by the movie, requested they halt production or change the movie's name, as he felt it had drastically deviated from his novel; when they did neither, he sued them and subsequently lost the case.  The music was composed by  Klaus Doldinger . Some electronic tracks by  Giorgio Moroder  were added to the US version of the movie, as well as the titlesong Never Ending Story composed by  Giorgio Moroder  and  Keith Forsey  becoming a chart success for  Limahl , the former singer of  Kajagoogoo .\nThis film was an Italian/German production in which Michael Ende himself played the role of the passenger in the train (who is told the story by Master Hora and writes it down). It appears that Ende, unhappy with how the film based on  The Neverending Story  did not follow the spirit of the book faithfully enough, requested that he was involved more directly in filming Momo.\nThe  film score  of The NeverEnding Story was composed by  Klaus Doldinger  of the German jazz group  Passport . The  theme song of the North American release  of the film was composed by  Giorgio Moroder  with lyrics by  Keith Forsey , and performed by  Limahl  (lead singer of  Kajagoogoo ) and  Beth Anderson .

The song has been covered by  The Birthday Massacre ,  Creamy ,  Dragonland ,  Kenji Haga , and  New Found Glory . More recent covers were done by  Norwegian   synthpop  group  Echo Image  on their  2001   maxi-single  Skulk and by  German   techno  group  Scooter  on their  2007  album  Jumping All Over the World . This Limahl song, along with other \"techno-pop\" treatments to the soundtrack, is not present in the German version of the film, which features Doldinger's orchestral score exclusively.\nIn 1984, Moroder compiled a new restoration and edit of the  silent film   Metropolis  (1927) and provided it with a contemporary soundtrack. This soundtrack includes seven pop music tracks from  Pat Benatar ,  Jon Anderson ,  Adam Ant ,  Billy Squier ,  Loverboy ,  Bonnie Tyler  and  Freddie Mercury . He also integrated the old-fashioned  intertitle s into the film as  subtitle s as a means of improving continuity, and he also increased the film's framerate to 24 frames a second. Since the original speed was unknown this choice was controversial. Known as the \"Moroder version\", it sparked debate among film buffs, with outspoken critics and supporters of the film falling into equal camps. In 1984, Moroder worked with  Philip Oakey  of  The Human League  to make the album  Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder , which was a UK singles chart hit with \" Together in Electric Dreams \", title track to the 1984 film  Electric Dreams . The same year saw him collaborating with Kajagoogoo frontman Limahl for their worldwide hit \" The NeverEnding Story \".\n\"The NeverEnding Story\" is the title song from the English version of the 1984 film  The NeverEnding Story . It was performed by  Limahl . Limahl released two versions of the song, one in English and one in French. The English version featured vocals by  Beth Anderson , and the French version featured vocals by Ann Calvert. It was a success in many countries, reaching No. 1 in  Norway  and  Sweden , No. 2 in  Austria ,  Germany  and  Italy , No. 4 in the UK. No. 6 in Australia and No. 6 in the US Billboard  Adult Contemporary chart .\nAmong the commercial successes for German films of the 1980s were the Otto film series beginning in 1985 starring comedian  Otto Waalkes ,  Wolfgang Petersen 's adaptation of  The NeverEnding Story  (1984), and the internationally successful  Das Boot  (1981), which still holds the record for most  Academy Award  nominations for a German film (six).
