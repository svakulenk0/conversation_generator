It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data.  Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard  SQL language, using the  ANSI  standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional  RDBMS  SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries don't exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored.  Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement.  For example, partitioning by a customer id would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer.  This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution.   SQLstream Blaze also allows changes to be made to the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications.  This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application.  Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules.  In this way, it provides an effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data.  SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally.  Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases.  SQLstream is able to execute its queries in an optimized C++ multi-threaded dataflow engine which operates lock-free.
