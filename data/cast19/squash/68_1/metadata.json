{"input_text": "Ciccioli are pressed cakes of fatty pork. They are known under this name in  Emilia Romagna , being popular in  Modena ,  Reggio Emilia ,  Bologna ,  Parma  and  Romagna . In Naples they are called cicoli. In Lazio and Umbria they are called sfrizzoli. In  Calabria  they are called risimugli.\nEmilia-Romagna's intensive farming economy in the northern region of Italy results in plentiful dairy and meat products, and their commonality in regional cooking \u2013 more so than the olive oil found in southern regions of Italy. Pastas from Emilia-Romagna and its capital, Bologna, are almost always served with a  rag\u00f9 , a thick sauce made from ingredients such as onions, carrots, finely ground pork and beef, celery, butter, and tomatoes.\nTerrano wine is primarily grown in Western  Istria  wine region of  Croatia  (called \"Istarski Teran\" or \"Terrano D'Istria\" in Italian), as well as on the  Karst Plateau  within the  Slovene Littoral  wine region (where it is called Kra\u0161ki teran) and Italian  Carso DOC  (with two main varieties called Terrano del Carso and Carso Rosso (red Carso)). Teran is the principal red wine grape in these regions. In Croatia, Teran is considered one of its noblest red grape varieties. Its production in Istria spans over 700 years. In the Carso DOC, the grape is sometimes blended with  Piccola nera . In Italy it is also used in the DOC  Cagnina di Romagna  in  Emilia-Romagna .\nGnocco fritto , a widespread recipe all over the Emilia Romagna region, is mixed flour stripe fried in boiling oil, enjoyed in combination with ham or salami. In  Bologna  district gnocco fritto is also called crescentina.\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's  prosciutto ,  culatello  and  Felino salami , Piacenza's  pancetta ,  coppa  and salami, Bologna's  mortadella  and  salame rosa , Modena's  zampone ,  cotechino  and  cappello del prete   and  Ferrara 's  salama da sugo .  Reggio Emilia  is famous for its fresh egg-made pasta  cappelletti  (similar to Bologna's tortellini but differing in size), the typical  erbazzone  a spinach and  Parmigiano Reggiano  salted cake and its  Gnocco Fritto  some kind of mixed flour stripes fried in boiling oil, enjoyed in combination with ham or salami.  Crescentina  best known as  tigella  is the typical thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena and it is usually filled in with the typical cunza (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include  zuppa inglese  (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and  Alchermes  liqueur) and  panpepato  (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include  Sangiovese  from Romagna,  Lambrusco  from  Reggio Emilia  or  Modena ,  Cagnina di Romagna ,  Gutturnio  and  Trebbiano  from  Piacenza .\nAlmost half of Novello production comes from the northern  Veneto  region. It is followed by  Trentino ,  Tuscany ,  Sardinia ,  Emilia Romagna ,  Puglia , and  Friuli .\nItalian cuisine  has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy  did not unite until the 19th century , the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BCE. Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval and the discovery of the New World have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after the fall of the Roman Empire, when different cities began to separate and form their own traditions. Many different types of bread and pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. For example, the North of Italy ( Milan ) is known for its risottos, the central/middle of the country ( Bologna ) is known for its tortellini and the South ( Naples ) is famous for its  pizza s.\nAs  San Marino  is a  microstate  completely  landlocked  by Italy, Sammarinese cuisine is strongly similar to the  Italian cuisine , especially that of the adjoining  Emilia-Romagna  and  Marche  regions.\nEtymologically speaking, the term comes from the French  rago\u00fbt s and reached the region of  Emilia-Romagna  in the late 18th century, perhaps following  Napoleon 's 1796 invasion and occupation of those northern regions. Prior to that time, peninsula cuisine  had a long history of meat stews going back to the  Renaissance  period. However, they were neither known as 'rag\u00f9' nor is there any record of pairing them with pasta. Since the 16th century, it was not uncommon for pasta to be cooked in and served with a meat broth, often like a simple soup, from which the meat was removed and served separately, if eaten at all.\nJim Fiala\u2019s Italian restaurant is Acero in suburban  Maplewood, Missouri  (7266 Manchester Road). Acero\u2019s opening on March 2, 2007, was followed by an overwhelming number of positive reviews. In a city famous for Italian restaurants, Acero stands out. Acero is distinctive because it features the regional cuisine of  Tuscany  and  Emilia Romagna  in Northern Italy. Acero is the Italian word for maple.\nNorthern Italy, mountainous in many parts, is notable for the alpine cheeses of the Valle d'Aosta, the  pesto  of Liguria, and, in Piedmonte, the Alba truffle. In the Alto Adige, the influence of neighboring Austria may be found in a regional repertoire that includes speck and dumplings. In the north,  risotto  and  polenta  have tended to serve the staple function taken by pasta across the rest of the country. Italy's center includes the celebrated culinary regions of Tuscany \u2014 famous for its olive oil and bean dishes \u2014 and Emilia-Romagna \u2014 home of  prosciutto di Parma ,  parmigiano-reggiano , and  rag\u00f9  \u2014 the latter now produced (and traduced) worldwide as spaghetti alla bolognese. Southern Italy includes the hearty food of Lazio in which meat and offal frequently figure, but also the vegetable-focused fare of Basilicata, historically one of Italy's poorest regions. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia have distinctively different foodways. The former is notable for its many sweet dishes, seafood, and citrus fruit, while Sardinian cuisine has traditionally looked to its hilly interior with a cuisine centered on lamb, sucking pig, breads, and  pecorino sardo . It is in the food of Naples and Campania, however, that many visitors would recognize the foods that have come to be regarded as quintessentially Italian:  pizza , spaghetti with  tomato sauce , aubergine  parmigiana  (but the origins of the two last dishes are claimed by Sicily).\nBologna is renowned for its culinary tradition. It has given its name to the well-known  Bolognese sauce , a meat based pasta sauce called in Italy  rag\u00f9  alla bolognese but in the city itself just rag\u00f9 as in  Tagliatelle  al rag\u00f9. Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured  pork  meats such as  prosciutto ,  mortadella  and  salumi  is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include  Pignoletto  dei Colli Bolognesi,  Lambrusco  di Modena and  Sangioves e di Romagna.  Tagliatelle  with  rag\u00f9 ,  lasagne ,  tortellini  served in broth, and mortadella, the original  Bologna sausage , are among the local specialties. Traditional Bolognese desserts are often linked to holidays, such as fave dei morti, multi-coloured almond paste cookies made for  All Saints' Day , jam-filled raviole cookies that are served on  Saint Joseph's Day , and carnival sweets known as sfrappole, a light and delicate fried pastry topped with powder sugar. Torta di riso, a custard-like cake made of almonds, rice and amaretto, is made throughout the year.\nTraditional cuisine remains a strong part of Cadelbosco's identity, which takes its influence from Emilia-Romagna's authentic dishes such as tortelli di zucca, erbazzone, gnocco fritto, homemade pasta,  zampone  and  cotechino  with beans, pork and rabbit meat.  Parmigiano-Reggiano  cheese and  Lambrusco  wine are also a major part of the cuisine.\nEmilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regards to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour.  Bologna  is notable for pasta dishes like  tortellini ,  lasagne ,  gramigna  and  tagliatelle  which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations.  The  Romagna  subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like,  garganelli ,  strozzapreti ,  sfoglia lorda  and  tortelli alla lastra . In the  Emilia  subregion, except  Piacenza  which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of  Lombardy , rice is eaten to a lesser extent.  Polenta , a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated  balsamic vinegar  is made only in the Emilian cities of  Modena  and  Reggio Emilia , following legally binding traditional procedures.  Parmigiano Reggiano  (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while  Grana Padano  variety is produced in the rest of the region.\nIn the  Emilia  subregion, except  Piacenza  which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of  Lombardy , rice is eaten to a lesser extent.  Polenta , a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna.\nEmilia-Romagna  is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. The  Romagna  subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like  cappelletti ,  garganelli ,  strozzapreti , sfoglia lorda and tortelli alla lastra or very peculiar cheese like  squacquerone ,  piada  snacks are famous worldwide.\nCrescentina  is a bread in  Italian cuisine  from the  Emilia-Romagna  region of Italy. It is prepared using flour, water and lard as primary ingredients.  Cracklings  are sometimes used in its preparation. In Emilia-Romagna, it is typically sliced into diamond shapes and then fried, and may be accompanied with cheese and  salumi . When it is fried, the bread puffs up. Versions prepared with milk are softer than those prepared with water, and it may include yeast or baking soda to leaven it. It may be served as an appetizer or as a main dish. In Italy, crescentina is sometimes referred to as a kind of gnocchi, although it is not technically  gnocchi . In Emilia-Romagna, crescentina is referred to as gnocco fritto.\nIn 1993 Rosetto Kasper won the James Beard Cookbook of the Year Award for her book The Splendid Table: Recipes from Emilia Romagna, The Heartland of Northern Italian Food.  Her radio show has won the prestigious James Beard Award on two occasions: in 1998 for Best National Radio Show and 2008 for Best Radio Food Show.\nA key factor in the success of Italian cuisine is its heavy reliance on traditional products; Italy has the most  traditional specialities  protected under  EU law .  Cheese ,  cold cuts  and  wine  are a major part of Italian cuisine, with many regional declinations and  Protected Designation of Origin  or  Protected Geographical Indication  labels, and along with  coffee  (especially  espresso ) make up a very important part of the Italian  gastronomic  culture. Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as  citrus fruits ,  pistachio  and  almonds  with sweet cheeses like  mascarpone  and  ricotta  or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon.  Gelato ,  tiramis\u00f9  and  cassata  are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.\nRicotta  tortelli, served with butter and herbs, is a popular dish in  Romagna . Other typical dishes include tortelli with  pumpkin  (common in  Mantua ,  Reggio Emilia ,  Piacenza , and  Cremona ) and tortelli di parma (from  Parma ), with ricotta and herbs, spinach, potatoes, or pumpkin.\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to  Italian , especially that of the adjoining  Emilia-Romagna  and  Marche  regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the  Torta Tre Monti  (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the  Three Towers of San Marino . The country also has a small  wine  industry.\nIt is named after the producing areas, which comprise the  provinces  of  Parma ,  Reggio Emilia ,  Bologna  (only the area to the west of the river Reno),  Modena  (all in  Emilia-Romagna ), and  Mantua  (in  Lombardy , but only the area to the south of river Po),  Italy . Under Italian law, only cheese produced in these provinces may be labelled \"Parmigiano-Reggiano\", and European law classifies the name, as well as the translation \"Parmesan\", as a  protected designation of origin . Parmigiano is the  Italian  adjective for Parma and Reggiano is the adjective for Reggio Emilia. Outside the EU, the name \"Parmesan\" can legally be used for  cheeses similar to Parmigiano-Reggiano , with only the full Italian name unambiguously referring to Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It has been called the \"King of Cheeses\".\nPasta is generally served with some type of sauce; the sauce and the type of pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs. In Northern Italy  white sauce  is more common. However Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in  Trentino-Alto Adige  and  Emilia Romagna . In Bologna, the meat-based  Bolognese sauce  incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called  pesto  originates from Genoa. In  Central Italy , there are sauces such as  tomato sauce ,  amatriciana ,  arrabbiata  and the egg-based  carbonara .Tomato sauces are also present in  Southern Italian  cuisine, where they originated. In Southern Italy more complex variations include pasta paired with fresh vegetables, olives, capers or seafood. Varieties include  puttanesca , pasta alla norma (tomatoes, eggplant and fresh or baked cheese),  pasta con le sarde  (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil), spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino (literally with garlic, [olive] oil and hot chili peppers).\nEmilia-Romagna is the home region of world famous Italian director Federico Fellini-a true Piada lover-whose movies inspired the names of our Piadas. Piada (also known as Piadina) is a very popular Italian flat bread sandwich that is a specialty of the Emilia-Romagna region.Ogni donna fa la Piada a modo suo (Every woman makes piada in her own special way).With these words, mocking an old Italian saying, Maddalena Fellini (sister of Federico) perfectly describes the variety of ways in which a piada can be made.gni donna fa la Piada a modo suo (Every woman makes piada in her own special way). With these words, mocking an old Italian saying, Maddalena Fellini (sister of Federico) perfectly describes the variety of ways in which a piada can be made.\nIn Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham (prosciutto), sausage (cotechino), different sorts of salami, truffles, grana, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and tomatoes (Bolognese sauce or rag\u00c3\u00b9). Traditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In Tuscany pasta (especially pappardelle) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat).\nAnswer by GeordieSteve. Confidence votes 7.5K.
