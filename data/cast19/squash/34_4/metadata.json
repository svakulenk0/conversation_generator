{"input_text": "In the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series.  In Peoples of the Sea he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt.   Manetho 's  20th dynasty  here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and  Nectanebo I  is a ghost double of  Rameses III .  Rameses III fought invasions by the  Sea Peoples , including the \"Peleset\", conventionally identified with the  Philistines .  According to Velikovsky, the \"Peleset\" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries.  The  21st dynasty  then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the  oases  simultaneously with the Persians.\nGroups of the Sea Peoples mentioned in Egyptian documents are the Ekwesh, a group of Bronze Age  Greeks  (Achaeans; Ahhiyawa in Hittite texts);  Teresh ,  Tyrrhenians  (Tyrsenoi), known to later Greeks as sailors and pirates from Anatolia, ancestors of the Etruscans;  Luka , an  Anatolians  coastal people of western Anatolia, also known from Hittite sources (their name survives in classical  Lycia  on the southwest coast of Anatolia);  Sherden , probably  Sardinians  (the Sherden acted as mercenaries of the Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh, 1299 BCE);  Shekelesh , probably identical with the  Italic  tribe called  Siculi ; and  Peleset , generally believed to refer to the  Philistines , who perhaps came from Crete and were the only major tribe of the Sea Peoples to settle permanently in  Palestine .\nMuch earlier, the  Sea Peoples  was a  confederacy  of seafaring raiders who sailed into the eastern shores of the  Mediterranean , caused political unrest, and attempted to enter or control  Egypt ian territory during the late  19th dynasty , and especially during Year 8 of  Ramesses III  of the  20th Dynasty . The Egyptian Pharaoh  Merneptah  explicitly refers to them by the term \"the foreign-countries (or 'peoples') of the sea\" in his  Great Karnak Inscription .  Although some scholars believe that they \"invaded\"  Cyprus  and the  Levant , this hypothesis is disputed.\nIn the 13th century BCE, at the end of the  Bronze Age , seafaring invaders from  Europe  and the  Aegean  known as the  Sea Peoples  entered the  Eastern Mediterranean , invading  Anatolia ,  Syria ,  Canaan ,  Cyprus  and  Egypt . The invasions by the Sea Peoples ushered the  Bronze Age Collapse , which resulted in the cultural collapse of  Mycenean Greece , the  Hittite Empire , the  New Kingdom of Egypt  and the civilizations of Canaan and Syria. The Sea Peoples are regarded as being composed of various groups of  Indo-European  peoples.\nIn 1178 BCE, the  Battle of Djahy (Canaan)  between  Ramesses III  and the  Sea Peoples  marked the beginning of the decline in power of the  New Kingdom  in the  Levant  during the wider  Bronze Age collapse .\nThe inscriptions at Medinet Habu consist of images depicting a coalition of Sea Peoples, among them the Peleset, who are said in the accompanying text to have been defeated by Ramesses III during his Year 8 campaign. In about 1175 BC, Egypt was threatened with a massive land and sea invasion by the \"Sea Peoples,\" a coalition of foreign enemies which included the  Tjeker , the Shekelesh, the Deyen, the Weshesh, the Teresh, the  Sherden , and the PRST. They were comprehensively defeated by Ramesses III, who fought them in \" Djahy \" (the eastern Mediterranean coast) and at \"the mouths of the rivers\" (the  Nile Delta ), recording his victories in a series of inscriptions in his mortuary temple at  Medinet Habu . Scholars have been unable to conclusively determine which images match what peoples described in the  reliefs  depicting two major battle scenes. A separate relief on one of the bases of the Osirid  pillar s with an accompanying hieroglyphic text clearly identifying the person depicted as a captive Peleset chief is of a bearded man without headdress. This has led to the interpretation that Ramesses III defeated the  Sea Peoples  including Philistines and settled their captives in fortresses in southern Canaan; another related theory suggests that Philistines invaded and settled the coastal plain for themselves. The soldiers were quite tall and clean shaven. They wore  breastplate s and short  kilt s, and their superior weapons included  chariot s drawn by two horses. They carried small shields and fought with straight swords and spears.\nThe  Eurasian Grass-Steppe  of the  temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands  had a role in the spread of  the horse, the wheel , and the  Indo-European languages . The  Indo-European expansion  and diverse invasions of  horse archer civilizations  of the steppe eventually led to, e.g., the rise of  Mycenaean Greece  by amalgamation of Indo-Europeans with the autochthonous pre-Greek population and also its destruction during the  Dorian invasion  in the  Late Bronze Age collapse , followed by the demise of the  Achaeans , the spread of the  Sea Peoples , and eventually the rise of  Archaic  and ultimately  Classical Greece .\nThe Mycenaean civilization started to collapse from 1200 BC. Archaeology suggests that, around 1100 BC, the palace centres and outlying settlements of the Mycenaeans' highly organized culture began to be abandoned or destroyed, and by 1050 BC, the recognizable features of Mycenaean culture had disappeared, and the population had decreased significantly. Many explanations attribute the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and the  Bronze Age collapse  to climatic or environmental catastrophe, combined with an invasion by  Dorians  or by the  Sea Peoples , or to the widespread availability of edged weapons of iron, but no single explanation fits the available  archaeological evidence .\nThis theory suggests that the Sea Peoples were populations from the city states of the Greek  Mycenaean civilization , who destroyed each other in a disastrous series of conflicts lasting several decades. There would have been few or no external invaders and just a few excursions outside the Greek-speaking part of the  Aegean civilization .\nMichael Wood has  suggested that their raids contributed greatly to the collapse of the  Mycenaean  civilization. However, while some Aegean attributes can be seen in the material culture of the  Philistines , one of the  Sea Peoples  who established cities on the southern coastal plain of  Canaan  at the beginning of the  Iron Age , the association of the Sherden with this geographic area is based entirely on their association with this group and the Sea Peoples phenomenon writ large, rather than on physical or literary evidence (of which almost all testifies to their presence in Egypt rather than their port of origin).\nThe Sea Peoples  are a purported seafaring  confederation  of groups known to have attacked  ancient Egypt  prior to the  Late Bronze Age collapse . Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of  Wilhelm Max M\u00fcller : \"the most important questions of  ethnography  and the primitive history of classic nations\".\nDuring the late 13th century BC the peoples of the  Aegean Sea  took to marauding and resettling as a way of life and were called by the Egyptians the  Sea Peoples . Mycenaean Greeks must have been among them. They settled lightly on the shores of  Luwian  Anatolia often by invitation. In the background was the stabilizing influence of the Hittites, who monitored maritime movement and suppressed piracy. When that power was gone the Luwian people remained in the vacuum as a number of coastal splinter states that were scarcely able now to defend themselves. Ionian Greeks took advantage of opportunities for coastal raiding: an inscription of  Sargon II  (ca 709\u201307,recording a naval expedition of 715) boasts \"in the midst of the sea\" he had \"caught the Ionians like fish and brought peace to the land of Que  Cilicia  and the city of  Tyre \". For a full generation earlier Assyrian inscriptions had recorded troubles with the Ionians, who escaped on their boats.\nThe various Sea Peoples have been proposed to have originated either from western  Anatolia  or from  Southern Europe . Although the archaeological inscriptions do not include reference to a migration, the Sea Peoples are conjectured to have sailed around the  eastern Mediterranean  and invaded Anatolia,  Syria ,  Canaan ,  Cyprus , and Egypt toward the end of the  Bronze Age .\nWhile the battle ended with a great Egyptian victory, Egypt's war with the Sea Peoples was not yet over. The Sea Peoples would attack Egypt proper with their naval fleet, around the mouth of the Nile river. These invaders were defeated  in a great sea battle  during which many were either killed by hails of Egyptian arrows, or dragged from their boats and killed on the banks of the Nile river by Ramesses III's well prepared forces.\nThe  Linear B  Tablets of  Pylos  in the  Late Bronze Age  in the  Aegean  demonstrate increased slave raiding and the spread of mercenaries and migratory peoples and their subsequent resettlement. Despite this, the actual identity of the Sea Peoples has remained enigmatic and modern scholars have only the scattered records of ancient civilizations and archaeological analysis to inform them. Evidence shows that the identities and motives of these peoples were known to the Egyptians. In fact, many had sought employment with the Egyptians or were in a diplomatic relationship for a few centuries before the Late  Bronze Age Collapse . For example, select groups, or members of groups, of the Sea People, such as the Sherden or  Shardana , were used as mercenaries by Egyptian Pharaohs such as  Ramesses II .\nThe Tjeker or Tjekker were one of the  Sea Peoples .\nIn the 13th century BC, however, invasions from the  Balkans  (the so-called  sea people ) destroyed Troy VII, and Central and Western Anatolia as a whole fell into what is generally called the period of \"Anatolian\" and \"Greek\"  Dark Ages  of the  Bronze Age collapse .\nIncreasingly, the Iron Age in Europe is being seen as a part of the  Bronze Age collapse  in the  ancient Near East , in   ancient India  (with the post- Rigvedic   Vedic civilization ),  ancient Iran , and  ancient Greece  (with the  Greek Dark Ages ). In other regions of  Europe , the Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in  Central Europe  and the 6th century BC in  Northern Europe . The Near Eastern Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200\u20131000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous  Late Bronze Age . There is no definitive cultural break between the 13th and 12th century BC throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country,  Transjordan , and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the  Aramaean  and  Sea People  groups. There is evidence, however, that shows strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late 2nd millennium.\nAround this time large-scale revolts took place in several parts of the eastern Mediterranean, and attempts to overthrow existing kingdoms were made as a result of economic and political instability by surrounding people, who were already plagued with famine and hardship. Part of the  Hittite  kingdom was invaded and conquered by the so-called  Sea Peoples , whose origins, perhaps from different parts of the Mediterranean such as the  Black Sea , the Aegean and Anatolian regions, remain obscured. The 13th- and 12th-century inscriptions and carvings at  Karnak  and  Luxor  are the only sources for \"Sea Peoples\", a term invented by the Egyptians themselves and recorded in boastful accounts of Egyptian military successes: For these so called \"Sea People\", there is little more evidence than these inscriptions.\nSubsequent critical analysis focused on the fact that the destructions were not simultaneous and that all the evidence of  Dorians  comes from later times.  John Chadwick  championed a Sea Peoples hypothesis, which asserted that, since the Pylians had retreated to the northeast, the attack must have come from the southwest, the Sea Peoples being, in his view, the most likely candidates. He suggests that they were based in  Anatolia  and, although doubting that the Mycenaeans would have called themselves \"Achaeans\", speculates that \"... it is very tempting to bring them into connexion.\" He does not assign a Greek identity to all of the Sea Peoples.\nThere is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural patterns which some scholars think may indicate an invasion (or at least a migration) into Southern Great Britain around the 12th century BC. This disruption was felt far beyond Britain, even beyond Europe, as most of the great  Near East ern empires collapsed (or experienced severe difficulties) and the  Sea Peoples  harried the entire  Mediterranean  basin around this time.  Cremation  was adopted as a burial practice, with  cemeteries  of  urns  containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record. According to  John T. Koch  and others, the Celtic languages developed during this Late Bronze Age period in an intensely trading-networked culture called the  Atlantic Bronze Age  that included  Britain, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal, but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the  Hallstatt culture .\nAfter 1180s BCE, amid general turmoil in the  Levant  associated with the sudden arrival of the  Sea Peoples , and the  collapse of the Bronze Age  the empire disintegrated into several independent  Syro-Hittite  (Neo-Hittite) city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BCE. In the West, Greeks were arriving on the Anatolian coast, and the  Kaskas  along the northern Black Sea coast. Eventually  Hattusha  itself was destroyed around 1200 BCE and the age of Empires shifted to that of regional states as the Bronze Age transitioned into the Iron Age.\nEmily Vermeule  suggests that the disruption of commercial networks at the end of the 13th century BC was disastrous for Greece and this was followed by the coming of the mysterious \" Sea People s\", who caused chaos in the Aegean. According to Egyptian records, the \"Sea Peoples\" destroyed the  Hittite Empire  then attacked the 19th and the 20th dynasties of Egypt, (circa 1300\u20131164). They may be related with the destruction of the Mycenaean centers (the records of  Pylos  mention sea-attack). However at the end of LHIIIB period, the Mycenaeans undertook an expedition against Troy, which meant that the sea was safe with no indication of destruction in the Aegean islands.\nWhen the Middle Assyrian Empire began to deteriorate in the late 11th century BC,  Canaan ites and  Phoenicia ns came to the fore and occupied the coast, and  Arameans  and  Suteans  supplanted the  Amorites  in the interior, as part of the general disruptions and exchanges associated with the  Bronze Age Collapse  and the  Sea Peoples . During this period the bulk of Syria became known as  Eber Nari  and  Aramea .\nThe power of the Egyptians in the region began to decline in the 12th century BCE, during the  Bronze Age collapse . The  Battle of Djahy  ( Djahy  being the Egyptian name for  Canaan ) in 1178 BCE between  Ramesses III  and the  Sea Peoples  marked the beginning of this decline. The gradual loss of a central power gave rise to independent kingdoms in the region. According to the Bible, Jerusalem at this time was known as  Jebus  and its independent  Canaanite  inhabitants at this time were known as  Jebusites .\nSome scholars have theorized that such a migration could have occurred more recently than classical sources suggest, and have sought to fit the Phrygian arrival into a narrative explaining the downfall of the  Hittite Empire  and the end of the high Bronze Age in Anatolia. According to this \"recent migration\" theory, the Phrygians invaded just before or after the collapse of the Hittite Empire at the beginning of the 12th century BC, filling the political vacuum in central-western Anatolia, and may have been counted among the \" Sea Peoples \" that Egyptian records credit with bringing about the Hittite collapse. The so-called Handmade Knobbed Ware found in Western Anatolia during this period has been tentatively identified as an import connected to this invasion.\nThe Harris Papyrus which was found in a tomb at Medinet Habu also recalls Ramesses III's battles with the Sea Peoples, declaring that the Peleset were \"reduced to ashes.\" The  Papyrus Harris I , records how the defeated foe were brought in captivity to Egypt and settled in fortresses. The Harris papyrus can be interpreted in two ways: either the captives were settled in Egypt and the rest of the Philistines/Sea Peoples carved out a territory for themselves in Canaan, or else it was Ramesses himself who settled the Sea Peoples (mainly Philistines) in  Canaan  as mercenaries. Egyptian strongholds in Canaan are also mentioned, including a temple dedicated to  Amun , which some scholars place in  Gaza ; however, the lack of detail indicating the precise location of these strongholds means that it is unknown what impact these had, if any, on Philistine settlement along the coast.\nIn the  South China Sea  area, the ethnic group name is called as  Orang Laut , which literally means \"the sea people\" in  Malay . These  Malay people s of Southeast Asia trace their forbears to  Yunnan  (now a province of  China ) some 5000\u201310000 years ago. They were seafarers that migrated along rivers such as  Mekong  and  Irrawady  to the  Andaman Sea ,  South China Sea  and various locations in the  Malay archipelago . In the 15th century, large numbers of Malay Seafarers converted to  Islam .\nThe city became one of the most important centres in the Hittite Empire, during the Late Bronze Age, and reached its apogee around the 11th century BC.  While the Hittite empire fell to the  Sea Peoples  during the  Bronze Age collapse , Carchemish survived the Sea People's attacks to continue to be  the capital of an important  Neo-Hittite  kingdom in the  Iron Age , and a trading center. Although Ramesses III states in an inscription dating to his 8th Year from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple that Carchemish was destroyed by the Sea Peoples, the city evidently survived the onslaught. King Kuzi-Tesup I is attested in power here and was the son of  Talmi-Teshub  who was a contemporary of the last Hittite king,  Suppiluliuma II . He and his successors ruled a \"mini-empire\" stretching from Southeast Asia Minor to Northern Syria and the West bend of the Euphrates under the title \"Great King\". This suggests that Kuzi-Tesub saw himself as the true heir of the line of the great Suppiliuma I and that the central dynasty at Hattusa was now defunct. This powerful polity lasted from c.1175 to 975 BC when it began losing control of its farther possessions and became gradually a more local city state centered around Carchemish.\nThe  Arameans  and  Phrygians  were subjected, and Assyria and its colonies were not threatened by the  Sea Peoples . However, after the death of Tiglath-Pileser I in 1076 BC, Assyria withdrew to its natural borders in northern Mesopotamia. Assyria retained a stable monarchy, the best army in the world and an efficient civil administration, thus enabling it to survive the Bronze Age Collapse intact and, from the late 10th century BC, it once more began to assert itself internationally.\nThe development of iron smelting was once attributed to the  Hittites  of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. It was believed that they maintained a monopoly on ironworking, and that their empire had been based on that advantage. Accordingly, the invading  Sea Peoples  were responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. This theory is no longer held in the common current thought of the majority of scholarship, since there is no archaeological evidence of the alleged Hittite monopoly. While there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period; and only a small number of these objects are weapons. As part of the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age, the  Bronze Age collapse  saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region. The  Ugaritic script  was in use during this time, around 1300 BC.  Ugarit  was one of the centres of the literate world.\nIn Egypt, Ramesses III was fighting to save his country and Empire in the midst of the Bronze Age collapse, a prolonged period of region-wide droughts, crop failures, depopulation, and collapse of urban centers.  It is likely that the Nile irrigated lands remained fruitful and would have been highly desirable to Egypt\u2019s neighbors. During this chaotic time, a new warlike group of people from the north, the Sea People, repeatedly attacked and plundered various Near Eastern powers.\nAfter defeating the Sea Peoples on land in Syria, Ramesses rushed back to Egypt where preparations for the invaders' assault had already been completed. According to the Medinet Habu inscriptions, Ramesses looked towards the sea and stared at a force of thousands of enemies and, with them, the threat of the end of the Egyptian empire. Ramesses lined the shores of the  Nile Delta  with ranks of archers who were ready to release volleys of arrows into the enemy ships if they attempted to land. Knowing that he would be defeated in the battle at sea, Ramesses enticed the  Sea Peoples  and their ships into the mouth of the  Nile , where he had assembled a fleet in ambush. This Egyptian fleet worked the Sea Peoples' boats towards shore.  Then archers both on land and on the ships devastated the enemy.  The Sea People's ships were overturned, many were killed and captured and some even dragged to the shore where they were killed.  In the inscriptions, Ramesses proclaims:\nThe  Sea peoples  is the term used for a confederacy of seafaring raiders of the second millennium BC who sailed into the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, caused political unrest, and attempted to enter or control  Egypt ian territory during the late  19th dynasty , and especially during Year 8 of  Ramesses III  of the  20th Dynasty . The Egyptian Pharaoh  Merneptah  explicitly refers to them by the term \"the foreign-countries (or 'peoples') of the sea\" in his  Great Karnak Inscription . Although some scholars believe that they \"invaded\"  Cyprus ,  Hatti  and the  Levant , this hypothesis is disputed.\nMycenaean Greece perished with the  collapse of Bronze Age culture  in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called  Greek Dark Ages , a recordless transitional period leading to  Archaic Greece  where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio-economic organization (including the extensive use of iron). Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the  Dorian invasion  or activities connected to the \u201c Sea Peoples \u201d. Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have been also suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient  Greek literature  and  mythology , including the  Trojan Epic Cycle .\nThe Sea People invasions are often listed among the causes or symptoms of the  Bronze Age collapse .  Ramesses had fought the Sea Peoples in southern  Lebanon , at the  Battle of Djahy . Ramesses III describes a great movement of peoples in the East from the Mediterranean, which caused a massive destruction of the former great powers of the Levant, Cyprus and Anatolia:\nAmong the Sea Peoples were the first ethnic Greeks to migrate to the Levant. At least three of the nine tribes of the Sea Peoples are believed to have been ethnic Greeks; the  Denyen ,  Ekwesh , and the Peleset, although some also include the  Tjeker . According to scholars, the Peleset were allowed to settle the coastal strip from Gaza to Joppa becoming the  Philistines . While the Denyen settled from Joppa to Acre, and the Tjeker in Acre. The political vacuum, which resulted from the collapse of the Hittite and Egyptian Empire's saw the rise of the  Syro-Hittite states , the Philistine, and  Phoenicia n Civilizations, and eventually the  Neo-Assyrian Empire .\nAround approximately the fourteenth century BC, the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas exhibited the development of perhaps one of the first populations of seamen suffering from the effects of poverty and terrain unsuitable for agriculture cultivation. The  \"notorious Sea Peoples\"  were a population of individuals of humble means who resorted to piracy when fishing could not sustain the population.By the end of the War of Spanish succession, \"as working conditions in the merchant industry rapidly deteriorated, seamen turned to the black flag by the thousands.\"  John Jessup detailed the \"jovial life among the pirates\" that was perceived and experienced as \"better than working at the big slave-trading fort of Cape Coast castle.\"\nThey were raiders associated with the Eastern  Mediterranean   Dark Ages  who attacked Egypt in 1207 BC in alliance with the Libyans and other Sea Peoples, as well as during the reign of  Rameses III . The  20th Egyptian Dynasty  allowed them to settle in  Canaan , which was largely controlled by the Sea Peoples into the 11th century BC.\nRamesses III had previously defeated an attack by the  Libyans  on the Egyptian Empire's western frontier, in his fifth year.  A greater threat was posed by a group of migrating peoples called the Sea Peoples.  These were times of crisis in the Mediterranean, as many 12th century BC  civilizations were destroyed by the Sea Peoples and other migrating nations . The great  Hittite Empire  fell, as did the  Mycenaean civilization , the kingdom of Cyprus and Ugarit, and other great cultures.\nPrior to and during the Bronze Age Collapse, Syria became a battle ground between the empires of the  Hittites ,  Assyrians ,  Mitanni  and  Egyptians , and the coastal regions came under attack from the  Sea Peoples . From the 13th century BC, the  Arameans  came to prominence in Syria, and the region outside of the  Phoenicia n coastal areas eventually spoke  Aramaic .\nIn the thirteenth century BC, invasions from the west by the Hittites and the south by the  Assyria ns brought the end of the Mitanni empire, which was divided between the two conquering powers. In the following century, attacks by the  Sea Peoples  brought a swift end to the last vestiges of the Hurrian language. It is around this time that other languages, such as the  Hittite language  and the  Ugaritic language  also became extinct, in what is known as the  Bronze Age collapse . In the texts of these languages, as well as those of  Akkadian  or Urartian, many Hurrian names and places can be found.\nDuring his long tenure in the midst of the surrounding political chaos of the  Greek Dark Ages , Egypt was beset by foreign invaders (including the so-called  Sea Peoples  and the  Libyans ) and experienced the beginnings of increasing economic difficulties and internal strife which would eventually lead to the collapse of the Twentieth Dynasty. In Year 8 of his reign, the Sea Peoples, including  Peleset ,  Denyen ,  Shardana ,  Meshwesh  of the sea, and  Tjekker , invaded Egypt by land and sea. Ramesses III defeated them in two great land and sea battles. Although the Egyptians had a reputation as poor seamen, they fought tenaciously. Rameses lined the shores with ranks of archers who kept up a continuous volley of arrows into the enemy ships when they attempted to land on the banks of the Nile. Then, the Egyptian navy attacked using grappling hooks to haul in the enemy ships. In the brutal hand-to-hand fighting which ensued, the Sea People were utterly defeated. The  Harris Papyrus  states:\nThe diverse group known collectively as the \" Sea Peoples \", a term used by  Ramesses III  on his mortuary temple at Medinet Habu as well as on numerous obelisks and stelae, may have also been pirates. It was there he recorded the accounts of attacks by named enemies of the Peleset ( Philistines ), and even the  Hittites , but several of the enemies he is shown to be subjugating are only given the uncertain epithet \"of the sea\". Ramesses III describes how he defeated them by drawing them inland, \"like the sand on the shore\". Possible members of the \"Sea Peoples\" include the Tjeker people of Crete, who left to settle Anatolia, the seat of the Hittite Empire, which is known to have clashed with the Egyptians.\nThe earliest migrations we can reconstruct from historical sources are those of the 2nd millennium BC. The  Proto-Indo-Iranians  began their expansion from c. 2000 BC, the  Rigveda  documenting the presence of early  Indo-Aryans  in the  Punjab  from the late 2nd millennium BC, and  Iranian tribes  being attested in Assyrian sources as in the  Iranian plateau  from the 9th century BC. In the  Late Bronze Age , the  Aegean  and  Anatolia  were overrun by moving populations, summarized as the \" Sea Peoples \", leading to the collapse of the  Hittite Empire  and ushering in the  Iron Age .\nThe late Bronze Age (14th-13th-12th centuries BC) saw a vast migration of the so-called  Sea Peoples , described in ancient Egyptian sources. They destroyed Mycenaean and  Hittite  sites and also attacked  Egypt . According to Giovanni Ugas the  Sherden , one of the most important tribes of the sea peoples, are to be identified with the Nuragic  Sardinians . Another hypothesis is that they arrived to the island around the 13th or 12th century after the failed invasion of Egypt. However, these theories remain controversial. Simonides of Ceos  and  Plutarch  spoke of raids by  Sardinians  against the island of  Crete , in the same period in which the Sea People invaded Egypt. This would at least confirm that Nuragic  Sardinians  frequented the eastern Mediterranean Sea.Further proofs come from 13th-century Nuragic ceramics found at  Tiryns ,  Kommos ,  Kokkinokremnos    and in  Sicily , at  Lipari   and the  Agrigento  area, along the sea route linking western to eastern Mediterranean.\nIt is thought that the increase in piracy and raiding associated with the  Bronze Age collapse , possibly produced by the  Peoples of the Sea , brought the trading system of oxhide ingots to an end. It was only with the recovery of Phoenician trade in the 10th and 9th centuries BC that saw a return to prosperity, and the appearance of real coinage, possibly first in Anatolia with  Croesus  of  Lydia  and subsequently with the Greeks and Persians. In Africa, many forms of value store have been used, including beads, ingots,  ivory , various forms of weapons, livestock, the  manilla currency , and ochre and other earth oxides. The manilla rings of  West Africa  were one of the currencies used from the 15th century onwards to sell slaves.  African currency  is still notable for its variety, and in many places various forms of  barter  still apply.\nMycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze-Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean. Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Sea People \u00e2\u0080\u009d.he Late Helladic period is further divided into LHI, LHII, both of which coincide with the early period of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1650\u00e2\u0080\u00931425 BC), and LHIII (c. 1425\u00e2\u0080\u00931050 BC), the period of expansion, decline and collapse of the Mycenaean civilization.\nPhoenician material culture shows so many elements from the Sea Peoples. The Phoenicians learned from them how to build harbors, moorings, docks, and piers. The Sea Peoples, like the Phoenicians, were excellent navigators\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they knew the routes west to the rich sources of metals.. Spencer Wells suspects that the Sea Peoples also introduced their genes into the DNA of the Canaanites.\nA 12th-century inscription describes Ramesses III\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defeat of the Sea Peoples. The Sea Peoples, a range of groups including the Philistines, led raids on the Eastern Mediterranean during the period of the Bronze Age collapse and are often cited as the reason for the collapse.\nIn the 12th century the Hittite empire suddenly collapses - overwhelmed, it is thought, by the onrush of the Sea Peoples. These terrifying intruders are described in Egyptian chronicles as raging down the coast to threaten the frontiers of Egypt in about 1218 and again in 1182 BC.\nIt was also believed that it was spread thought the Middle East by the Sea People, a confederacy of seafaring raiders whose provenance is unknown and who invaded Anatolia, Syria, Canaan (the Levant, modern-day Lebanon, Israel, the western part of Jordan and south-western Syria), Cyprus, and Egypt toward the end of the Bronze Age.", "key": "34_4", "timestamp": "2020-06-23 21:18:59.029441", "settings": {"top_p": 0.9, "gen_frac": 0.5, "spec_frac": 0.8}}
