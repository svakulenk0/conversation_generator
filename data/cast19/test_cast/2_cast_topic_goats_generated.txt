Although Boer goats raised specifically for show purposes may seem to have little in common with pastured commercial goats, the difference is superficial. They are bred to be larger than normal goats, and meet specific visual appearances, but these very characteristics are valuable genes to add to the commercial herd. Boer goats were originally imported into the US and other countries for this very reason. Their value to ranchers lies in the improvement the addition of their unique genes can offer any breed of goats being raised for meat. Few producers could afford to maintain a herd of essentially useless animals. Show goats are bred to represent the most desirable characteristics of the Boer goat, and their main purpose is to introduce these animals to the public. It is also a method of recognizing the best of the best, although some really superior goats are not shown.                 preference.

The Boer goat was probably bred from the indigenous goats (they originated from South Africa) of the  Namaqua,  San  and the  Fooku  tribes, with some crossing of Indian and European  bloodline s being possible. They were selected for  meat  rather than  milk  production; due to  selective breeding  and improvement, the Boer goat has a fast growth rate and excellent carcass qualities, making it one of the most popular breeds of meat goat in the world. Boer goats have a high resistance to disease and adapt well to hot, dry semi deserts. United States production is centered in west-central  Texas, and in Nebraska particularly in and around  San Angelo  and  Menard. The original US breeding stock came from herds located in New Zealand. Only later were they imported directly from South Africa.

Boer goats commonly have white bodies and distinctive brown heads. Some Boer goats can be completely brown or white or paint, which means large spots of a different color is on their bodies. Like the  Nubian goat, they possess long, pendulous ears. They are noted for being docile, fast-growing, and having high fertility rates. Does are reported to have superior mothering skills as compared to other breeds.. Boer goats tend to gain weight at about the same rate as their sire, so a buck from a proven fast-growing  bloodline  will command the highest price, as its offspring will tend to also be fast growers. The primary market for  slaughter  goats is a   kid ; kids should reach marketable size at weaning age. The kid of a proven fast-growing sire might weigh  at 90 days, while the kid of a poor-quality sire might weigh only  at 90 days. An average-quality buck will initially be less expensive to purchase; however, it can significantly undermine an operation's long-term  profitability.

The Pygmy goat is a breed of miniature domestic  goat. The pygmy goat can be used for many different things and that is why a pygmy goat is strictly classified as a multi purpose animal as stated on NPGA or national pygmy goat association. The pygmy goat is quite hardy, an asset in a wide variety of settings, and can adapt to virtually all  climate s. Castrated males are called wethers and can be shown in pet classes. There are also pedigree classes at shows for entire goats.  There are separate  pedigree  lineages in Europe and Africa (where they are sometimes called the African Pygmy) the United States. And this is because there were only a few hundred pygmy goats imported from Africa around 60 years ago.

What is the best for fiber production?
I don't know. But, I do know this-it is an animal fiber. This fine fiber actually comes from the Angora Goat. This goat is native to the Angora region of Turkey, but is now raised mainly in South Africa and the United States. The Angora goat grows beautiful long curly locks of fiber, as you can see in the photographs. This wonderful coat of fine fiber is sheared either once or twice a year, depending on the staple length (fiber length) required. These mohair fibers can be from 8 - 12 inches in length and come in a variety of shades. They used to be bred only in white so that the fiber could be dyed, though Angora goats are now bred in reds (apricot through to copper shades) or blacks (shades of grey through to black).
