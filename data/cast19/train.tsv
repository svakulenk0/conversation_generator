For details on choosing a goat breed, see âGet Your Goatâ in the November/December 2008 Grit (www.Grit.com/Animals/Get-Your-Goat.aspx).reating the goats as pets is made fun with a goat jungle gym. Raising goats can be fun, rewarding and frustrating â all at the same time. My first goat, Zygota, was a hellion. Milking was a battle where she performed a flamenco dance, often stomping her foot (triumphantly, it seemed) in the milk pail.	Can you milk Angora goats?
Their meat and milk production is not profitable enough like other goat breeds. Angora goats generally are of small sized, hardy, long-lived, requires minimal care and facilities and are relatively odor-free. This goat is available in almost all countries of the world.ike other goat breeds Angora goats are also browsers and love grazing and eating green grasses, corns, plants etc. They also generally eats a lots of roughage that includes weeds, bark, leaves or woody shrubs.	Can you milk Angora goats?
Land: How much land is available and what is its productivity? Poor ground may support 2-4 goats per acre while better pasture may be able to support 6-8 goats per acre. If you are adding goats to cattle, you can add 1-2 goats per head of cattle. Goats will eat the weeds cattle dislike, thus improving the grazing for the cattle.	How many goats can you have per acre?
Number of goats per acre is not relevant to raising meat goats. There is no formula of x many goats per acre that works with raising goats. The plant materials available to eat do not determine animal load. The defining factor for raising meat goats is how well you can control the worm load.	How many goats can you have per acre?
Land Requirements. Goats can be reared intensively on small acreage by using supplemental feed. If using an extensive system, 2 to 10 goats per acre is a rough guide depending on the supply of grass and brush. Goats are top down grazers and will select from weeds, leaves and grasses to meet their own requirements.	How many goats can you have per acre?
While browsing or grazing, they eat plants at their fullest nutritional value. A mixture of various types of grasses can meet up their needs. If you are planning for starting a profitable goat farming business, then you must have to learn what kind of grass do your goats like and the best grass for goats. Short description of some common grasses are listed below.	Are raising goats profitable?
So what are some of the benefits of raising goats? Raise your own meat. Raising goats for meat can be a great thing to do for your own family, to provide for your food needs, but it can also be a profitable small farm business - if thought through carefully and with an eye to where you will market it. Produce milk.	Are raising goats profitable?
Raising meat goats can be a profitable small farm venture. Currently in the United States, there is a higher demand for goat meat, also called chevon, than there is a supply. Many ethnic groups who live in the United States - from Hispanic to Eastern European to Southeastern Asian - rely on the lean, tasty meat as a protein staple.	Are raising goats profitable?
1 The term Neolithic Revolution was coined by an Australian archaeologist in the 1920s.

Early Neolithic farming was limited to a narrow range of plants, both wild and domesticated, which included  einkorn wheat ,  millet  and  spelt , and the keeping of  dogs ,  sheep  and  goats . By about 6,900–6,400 BC, it included domesticated  cattle  and  pig s, the establishment of permanently or seasonally inhabited settlements, and the use of  pottery . The Neolithic period saw the development of early  village s,  agriculture ,  animal   domestication ,  tool s and the onset of the earliest recorded incidents of  war fare. The Neolithic era commenced with the beginning of  farming , which produced the " Neolithic Revolution ". It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the  Copper Age  or  Bronze Age ; or, in some geographical regions, in the  Iron Age ).The term Neolithic is commonly used in the  Old World , as its application to cultures in the  Americas  and  Oceania  that did not fully develop metal-working technology raises problems.

New technologies developed in response to the need for better tools and weapons to go along with the new way of living. Neolithic farmers created a simple calendar to keep track of planting and harvesting. They also developed simple metal tools such as plows, to help with their work.uman beings lived in this manner from earliest times until about 10,000 BCE, when they started to cultivate crops and domesticate animals.

The Stone Age is divided by archaeologists (people who study relics) into three sections: Paleolithic (old stone), Mesolithic (middle stone) and Neolithic (new stone). Pottery was invented during the Neolithic Stone Age. Some people also believe the art of writing began in the Neolithic Stone Age.ome groups of people were still in the stone age into the 20th century. They also killed animals for food and clothing. The time after the Stone Age is the Bronze Age, named after the metal bronze. The Stone Age ended when people discovered the art of smelting (making metals).	What did the neolithic invent?

Neolithic, also known as the New Stone Age, was a time period roughly from 9000 BC to 5000 BC named because it was the last period of the age before wood working began. The tools available were made from natural materials including  bone , antler, hide,  stone , wood, grasses, animal fibers, and the use of water. These tools were used by people to cut such as with the  hand axe ,  chopper ,  adze , and  celt . Also to  scrape , chop such as with a  flake tool , pound, pierce, roll, pull, leaver, and carry. Building materials included bones such as  mammoth  ribs,  hide , stone, metal, bark, bamboo, clay,  lime plaster , and more.For example, the first  bridge s made by humans were probably just wooden logs placed across a stream and later  timber trackway s. In addition to  living in caves  and  rock shelter s, the first buildings were simple shelters,  tent s like the Inuit's  tupiq , and  huts  sometimes built as  pit-house s meant to suit the basic needs of protection from the elements and sometimes as fortifications for safety such as the  crannog . Built  self-sufficiently  by their inhabitants rather than by specialist builders, using locally available materials and traditional designs and methods which together are called  vernacular architecture . The very simplest shelters, tents, leave no traces. Because of this, what little we can say about very early construction is mostly conjecture and based on what we know about the way nomadic hunter-gatherers and herdsmen in remote areas build shelters today. The absence of metal tools placed limitations on the materials that could be worked, but it was still possible to build quite elaborate stone structures with ingenuity using  dry stone  walling techniques such as at  Skara Brae  in Scotland, Europe's most complete Neolithic village. The first  mud bricks , formed with the hands rather than wooden moulds, belong to the late Neolithic period and were found in  Jericho . One of the largest structures of this period was the  Neolithic long house . In all cases of  timber framed  and  log  structures in these very early cultures, only the very lowest parts of the walls and  post hole s are unearthed in archaeological excavations, making  reconstruction  of the upper parts of these buildings largely conjectural.

The rise of agriculture is one of the major changes of this era. In the Paleolithic age, humans used tools made out of stone and bones. These tools were used in hunting and fishing. In the Neolithic age, when people started agriculture, they used tools made up of copper.The prime innovation of this age was the development of pottery. The development of pottery products made it easier to cook and transport food.

The prime innovation of this age was the development of pottery. The development of pottery products made it easier to cook and transport food. People of the Paleolithic age had a simple technology. Gathering of food was their main objective. However, the people of the Neolithic age had a far developed and much more complex culture. They were farmers; they used to grow crops. These people had developed trade networks and made use of the barter system. They developed the basics of economy.	What tools were used during neolithic revolution?
Diverse images of what are believed to be mother goddesses have been discovered that also date from the  Neolithic  period, the New Stone Age, which ranges from about 10,000 BCE, when the use of wild cereals led to the beginning of farming and, eventually, to agriculture. The end of this Neolithic period is characterized by the introduction of  metal  tools as the skill appeared to spread from one culture to another, or arise independently as a new phase in an existing tool culture, and eventually, became widespread among humans. Regional differences in the development of this stage of tool development are quite varied. In other parts of the world, such as Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, independent domestication events led to their own patterns of development, while distinctive Neolithic cultures arose independently in Europe and Southwest Asia.

The site was one of the first  Neolithic   flint  mines in Britain and it was exploited throughout the period (the nearby Harrow Hill series of flint mines is slightly older). It is part of a group of flint mines in Sussex which followed a rich seam of flint-bearing chalk. Other examples include  Grimes Graves  in  Norfolk , and Harrow Hill nearby.Cissbury was one of several important mining industries in the UK during the Neolithic and is thought to have been used into the  Bronze age , and later the Iron Age though flint mining probably stopped during the late neolithic, but there is some evidence of re-use of flint for tools during later times. Axes and Blades (struck from cores) account for most of the tools produced at Cissbury and examples of Cissbury flint can be found as far as Italy. Axes were produced on site, as rough-outs, these were then traded or used off site. Many other types of stone were in demand for  stone axe s such as the  greenstone  of the  Langdale axe industry  in the  Lake District . The axes were essential for forest clearance for farming in the Neolithic period, and found many other uses, such as wood working.	What tools were used during neolithic revolution?
The Acheulean material was published by Fleisch in 1966 with the Neolithic remains studied by  Jacques Cauvin . Over three hundred Acheulean bifaces were collected along with various waste, used cores and rough-outs. It was mostly in brown, shiny flint, some with a grey film. The pieces were heavily patinated, sometimes with a number of different patinas. This allowed Fleisch to divide the tools into four groups, Early  Paleolithic ,  Middle Paleolithic , Middle/Late Paleolithic, and  Upper Paleolithic  with  Levallois technique  being used on cores in later periods. The Heavy Neolithic and Neolithic material was mostly in a creamy  chert  and consisted of  adze s,  chisel s, oval  axe s with retouch all over,  racloir s, cores and discs.  Lorraine Copeland  made a collection of similar materials in 1966 and noted the problems assigning material to specific periods. It seemed apparent that the Neolithic  flint  knappers had re-used older Acheulean tools and that the site had been a factory throughout numerous periods in a long and ancient history.	What tools were used during neolithic revolution?
The stone or  "lithic"  technology of the British Neolithic differed from that of Mesolithic and Palaeolithic Britain. Whereas Mesolithic hunter-gatherer tools were  microliths  – small, sharp shards of flint, Neolithic agriculturalists used larger lithic tools. Typically, these included  axe s, made out of either  flint  or hard  igneous rock  hafted on to wooden handles. While some of these were evidently used for chopping wood and other practical purposes, there are some axe heads from the period that appear never to have been used, some being too fragile to have been used in any case. These latter axes most likely had a decorative or ceremonial function.	What tools were used during neolithic revolution?
During the preceding  Mesolithic  period, the inhabitants of the British Isles had been Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers. Around 4000 BCE migrants began arriving from central Europe. Although the earliest indisputably acknowledged languages spoken in the British Isles belonged to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European family it is not known what language these early farming people spoke. These migrants brought new ideas, leading to a radical transformation of society and landscape that has been called the  Neolithic Revolution . The Neolithic period in the British Isles was characterised by the adoption of  agriculture  and sedentary living. To make room for the new farmland, these early agricultural communities undertook mass  deforestation  across the islands, dramatically and permanently transforming the landscape. At the same time, new types of stone tools requiring more skill began to be produced; new technologies included polishing.	When was neolithic revolution brought to the british isles?
The  classical age  (also the classical antiquity, classical period or classical era) is a broad term for a long period of cultural  history  generally centered on the  Mediterranean Sea  and  Near East , comprising the interlocking ancient civilizations, c. 600 BC to 200 AD. It is the period in which societies flourished and wielded great influence throughout East Asia, Europe, North Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. It is conventionally taken to begin with the earliest-recorded  Greek  poetry of  Homer  (8th–7th century BC), and continues through the  emergence of Christianity  and the  decline of the Roman Empire  (5th century AD). It ends with the dissolution of classical culture at the close of  Late Antiquity  and (AD 300–600), blending into the Dark Ages or Middle Age (AD 600–1000). Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. "Classical antiquity" may refer also to an idealised vision among later people of what was, in  Edgar Allan Poe 's words, "the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome!" The culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the  ancient Orient , prevailed throughout classical antiquity as the basis of art,the Bronze Age generally followed the  Neolithic  period. but in some parts of the world, the  Copper Age  served as a transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.

The metal period incorporates a long stretched timeline of over three millenniums, commencing from approximately 3500 BC up to middle of the 4th century BC. During the gradual evolution of the human society, from the usage of stone, the man advances to the usage of metals, namely, commencing primarily with the usage of copper since the second part of the fourth millennium BC. In fact, the new period is known as the  Copper Age  and chronologically commences with the end of the  Neolithic Period . Nevertheless, the Copper Age in the archaeological jargon is known as the Neolithic Period (eneus-copper and lithos-stone) or  Calcolithic , therefore, the binom Copper Age and Eneolithic mean the same distinguished metal emerging period, after the Neolithic and before the  Bronze Age .

Another significant development during this period was the migration of humans around the world, and the end of the last Ice Age period altering the climate.

The  Palaeolithic  period, literally the “ Old Stone Age ”, is an ancient cultural level of human development characterized by the use of unpolished chipped stone tools. The transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic is directly related to the development of behavioural modernity by hominids around 40,000 years BP. To denote the great significance and degree of change, this dramatic shift from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic is sometimes called the  Upper Palaeolithic Revolution .

Carbohydrates are made of building blocks called monosaccharides. Table sugar, called sucrose, is formed by the joining the two monosaccharides glucose and fructose.	What are the different types of macromolecules?
A macromolecule is a very large molecule made up of smaller units called monomers. The monomers may be the same or slightly different. Macromolecules are formed by dehydration reactions in which water molecules are removed from the formation of bonds. Four main types of macromolecules control all activities. They are proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and lipids. Their monomers are amino acids, sugars, nucleosides and glycerol and fatty acids.	What are the different types of macromolecules?
There are four basic kinds of biological macromolecules. They are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. These polymers are composed of different monomers and serve different functions.1  Carbohydrates-composed of sugar monomers and necessary for energy storage. 2  Lipids-include fats, phospholipids and steroids.3  Lipids help to store energy, cushion and protect organs, insulate the body and form cell membranes.here are four basic kinds of biological macromolecules.

What are lipids? Lipids are one of the four major groups of organic molecules; the other three being proteins, nucleic acids (DNA), and carbohydrates (sugars). Lipids are made up of the same elements as carbohydrates: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. However, lipids tend to contain many more hydrogen atoms than oxygen atoms. Lipids include fats, steroids, phospholipids, and waxes. One main characteristic of lipids is that they do not dissolve in water. What do they do? Lipids play an important role in living organisms. Some of their main functions include energy storage, hormones, and cell membranes. Types of Lipids Fats. What are fats? Fats are composed of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules. Just like all lipids, fat molecules are made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Fat is used as energy storage in our bodies.	Tell me about lipids.
An excess amount of blood lipids can cause fat deposits in your artery walls, increasing your risk for heart disease. What are blood lipids? Lipids are fat-like substances found in your blood and body tissues. Your body needs small amounts of lipids to work normally. How are my blood lipids measured? A blood test called a complete lipid profile is done. It is recommended that this test be done after an overnight fast. What happens if my lipids are too high? An excess amount of blood lipids can cause fat deposits in your artery walls, increasing your risk for heart disease. Are there different kinds of lipids? Cholesterol is the main lipid. It is made up of different parts such as: LDL cholesterol, or âbadâ cholesterol, is the main lipid that causes damaging buildup and blockage in your arteries. HDL cholesterol is actually a âgoodâ type of cholesterol that helps to prevent cholesterol from building up in your arteries. Triglyceride is another lipid that may increase your risk for heart disease.	Tell me about lipids.
Lipids are molecules that contain hydrocarbons and make up the building blocks of the structure and function of living cells. Examples of lipids include fats, oils, waxes, certain vitamins, hormones and most of the non-protein membrane of cells. What are lipids soluble in? Lipids are not soluble in water. They are non-polar and are thus soluble in nonpolar environments like in choloroform but not soluble in polar environments like water. What do lipids consist of? Lipids have mainly hydrocarbons in their composition and are highly reduced forms of carbon. When metabolized, lipids are oxidized to release large amounts of energy and thus are useful to living organisms.	Tell me about lipids.

What is the difference between lipids and carbohydrates?
Both carbohydrates and lipids have very many independent biological functions. The difference in function arises from their difference in chemistry. Here is the main distinction: Simple carbohydrates (sugar, glucose, fructose etc) are the main source of immediate energy. That is, they are metabolized easily and quickly. All our cells can use glucose for energy, so once it is metabolized and reaches the blood stream it can travel to other cells and tissues. However, lipids are good for storage. The fact that they are insoluble in water makes helps in this cause, and also they can provide twice as much energy (or more) as some carbohydrates. We don't fully understand many parts of lipid metabolism, for example, how we store fat and when and why we call it into action.	What is the difference between lipids and carbohydrates?

o Starch: alpha linkages, and branched The branching in glycogen allows for quick mobilization of glucose for energy. 11. Animals store energy as either a carbohydrate or a lipid. Why would an animal use both these molecules for energy storage? What structural differences facilitate their different uses? Carbohydrates: short term storage; branched for quick mobilization Lipids: long term storage; They are more reduced than carbohydrates yielding more energy per carbon, and they are hydrophobic, thus stored anhydrously, so there is more carbon per gram of lipids. Thus, they yield more energy/gram than carbohydrates. 12.	What is the difference between lipids and carbohydrates?

The International  Linguistics  Olympiad (IOL) is one of the newest in a group of thirteen  International Science Olympiad s. Its abbreviation IOL is deliberately chosen not to correspond to the name of the organization in any particular language, and member organizations are free to choose for themselves how to designate the competition in their own language. This olympiad furthers the fields of mathematical, theoretical, and descriptive linguistics.	Tell me about the International Linguistics Olympiad.
The first linguistic olympiad for secondary school students was organised in 1965 in  Moscow , Russia, on the initiative of  Alfred Zhurinsky  (1938–1991), eventually a prominent philologist but then only a fifth-year student of linguistics, in an organizing committee chaired by the mathematician  Vladimir Andreevich Uspensky  and with the participation of the linguists  Alexander Kibrik ,  Anna Polivanova  and  Andrey Zaliznyak . It was held regularly until 1982 and resumed again in 1988. Similar olympiads were founded in  Bulgaria  (1984),  Oregon , USA (1988) and  Saint Petersburg , Russia (1995). Since the foundation of the Bulgarian olympiad, teams of winners of the Moscow Linguistic Olympiad have successfully competed in Bulgaria and vice versa, demonstrating good potential for international cooperation in the field.

The setup differs from other Science Olympiads, in that the program contains both individual and team contests. The individual contest consists of 5 problems, covering the main fields of theoretical, mathematical and applied linguistics –  phonetics ,  morphology ,  semantics , etc. – which must be solved in six hours.	Tell me about the International Linguistics Olympiad.
The tasks used for the linguistics olympiad are generally stand-alone, i.e. for their solution, the contestant does not need to be familiar with the language on which the problem is set. Naturally, a basic knowledge in  linguistics ,  mathematics  and  general knowledge  is recommended.	How do I prepare for International Linguistics Olympiad?
An interesting experiment was olympiads in  linguistics  and mathematics, at which students were challenged to solve problems in both seemingly non-related domains. It was argued that problems in linguistics often require logical reasoning akin to that required in mathematics. After the olympiads, the problems (and solutions) were published in the  Science and Life   popular science  journal.	How do I prepare for International Linguistics Olympiad?

Like all  International Science Olympiad s, its problems are translated and completed in several languages and as such must be written free of any native language constraints. In practice, this is often difficult and competitors may gain some advantage if they are familiar with one or more of the language groups which are the subject of some of the assignments. However, the most helpful ability is analytic and deductive thinking, as all solutions must include clear reasoning and justification (as in solving mathematical problems).

Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as “linguistics-applied” at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment,  language policy , and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than  theoretical linguistics , including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to  "the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue."	Tell me about the history of linguistics as a field.
In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics—first to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The linguistics applied approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by  Leonard Bloomfield , who developed the foundation for the  Army Specialized Training Program , and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the  University of Michigan  in 1941. In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics, the first journal to bear the term applied linguistics. In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.	Tell me about the history of linguistics as a field.
Historical linguistics  emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century.  Sir William Jones  proposed that  Sanskrit ,  Persian ,  Greek ,  Latin ,  Gothic , and  Celtic languages  all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of  Ferdinand de Saussure 's  Cours de linguistique générale  created the development of  descriptive linguistics . Descriptive linguistics, and the related  structuralism  movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages.  Noam Chomsky  further diversified linguistics with the development of  generative linguistics  in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid  syntax . Additional specialties such as  sociolinguistics ,  cognitive linguistics , and  computational linguistics  have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.

A problem the energy analysis method cannot resolve is that different energy forms ( heat ,  electricity ,  chemical energy  etc.) have different quality and value even in natural sciences, as a consequence of the two main laws of  thermodynamics . A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is  exergy . According to the  first law of thermodynamics , all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the  second law  diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.

APP-ATP cycling supplies the  energy  needed to do work in a biological system, the  thermodynamic  process of transferring energy from one source to another. There are two types of energy:  potential energy  and  kinetic energy . Potential energy can be thought of as stored energy, or usable energy that is available to do work. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object as a result of its motion. The significance of ATP is in its ability to store potential energy within the phosphate bonds. The energy stored between these bonds can then be transferred to do work. For example, the transfer of energy from ATP to the protein  myosin  causes a conformational change when connecting to  actin  during  muscle contraction . It takes multiple reactions between myosin and actin to effectively produce one muscle contraction, and, therefore, the availability of large amounts of ATP is required to produce each muscle contraction. For this reason, biological processes have evolved to produce efficient ways to replenishment the potential energy of ATP from APP.	How can different forms of energy be stored?
Types of Energy. There are two types of energy: Potential (or stored energy) Kinetic (or energy in motion) Kinetic Energy is energy in motion. Moving water and wind are examples of kinetic energy. Electricity is kinetic energy because, even though you can't see it happen, electricity involves electrons moving in a conductor. Potential Energy is stored (or latent). Energy can be stored in many ways. A gallon of gasoline or a barrel of oil contains stored energy that can be released when we burn it.	How can different forms of energy be stored?

In the  physical science s, mechanical energy is the sum of  potential energy  and  kinetic energy . It is the  energy  associated with the motion and position of an object. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to  conservative force s the mechanical energy is constant. If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase and if the  speed  (not the  velocity ) of the object is changed, the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well. In all real systems, however,  non-conservative forces , like  frictional force s, will be present, but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation. In  elastic collision s, the mechanical energy is conserved but in  inelastic collision s, some mechanical energy is converted into heat.

Sound is a form of mechanical vibration which propagates through any mechanical medium. It is closely related to the ability of the human ear to perceive sound. The wide outer area of the ear is maximized to collect sound vibrations. It is amplified and passed through the outer ear, striking the eardrum, which transmits sounds into the inner ear. Auditory nerves fire according to the particular vibrations of the sound waves in the inner ear, which designate such things as the pitch and volume of the sound. The ear is set up in an optimal way to interpret sound energy in the form of vibrations.	Why is sound a form of mechanical energy?

In the  physical science s, mechanical energy is the sum of  potential energy  and  kinetic energy . It is the  energy  associated with the motion and position of an object. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to  conservative force s the mechanical energy is constant. If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase and if the  speed  (not the  velocity ) of the object is changed, the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well. In all real systems, however,  non-conservative forces , like  frictional force s, will be present, but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation. In  elastic collision s, the mechanical energy is conserved but in  inelastic collision s, some mechanical energy is converted into heat. The equivalence between lost mechanical energy ( dissipation ) and an increase in  temperature  was discovered by  James Prescott Joule .	How does mechanical energy differ from potential energy?

Potential Energy. Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. There are basically two main types of energy, kinetic and potential. Potential energy is energy that is stored. There are various types of stored, or potential energy. Chemical energy from a battery is a potential form of energy, elastic energy in a stretched rubber band is a form of potential energy, but the most commonly referred to form of potential energy in physics is that of gravitational potential energy. This is energy that is stored due to an object's position. It is dependent on the mass of the object, the height of the object above the ground or Earth, and the acceleration due to gravity. Examples of Potential Energy: 1. A rock sitting at the edge of a cliff has potential energy. If the rock falls, the potential energy will be converted to kinetic energy.

Though it is too far away from earth, one can see Uranus in night sky with naked eye. It looks like a pale star this way, but if you make use of a telescope, Uranus appears a small pale green disc in shape. The diameter of Uranus is almost 4 times that of earth (51100km). It is 15 times heavier than earth. One fact that is not only unusual, but also makes Uranus markedly different from earth is the angle of its spin axis. This spin axis is 98 degrees to the perpendicular and makes the planet lie almost on its sides. This is a mesmerizing sight and no one really knows the reason behind this phenomenon.	What makes Uranus so unusual?
Uranus is 14.5 times bigger than Earth, making it the third largest planet in the Solar System after Jupiter and Saturn; Uranusâs core alone is as large as our planet. The atmosphere of Uranus is composed of 83% helium, 15% methane and 2% methane plus trace amounts of other gases such as ethane. The average temperature of the surface of Uranus is 49Â° Kelvin or -224Â° Celsius. What makes the planet so cold is that it has a low internal temperature. At its core, Uranus is only 5000Â° K, compared to Jupiter, which as a core temperature of 30000Â° K. The reason for Uranusâs lack of internal warmth is unclear, although scientists speculate that it is related to its unusual axial tilt that is completely unlike the other planets of the Solar System; the planet rotates at an angle of 99 degrees.	What makes Uranus so unusual?
Uranus  is the third largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a distance of about 2.8 billion kilometers (1.7 billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the  plane of the ecliptic . This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought to be the result of a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were not at all sure what to expect when observing Uranus.

Uranus has a diameter of over 50,000 km-about 4 times that of the Earth and it is 3 billion km away from the sun. It takes Uranus 84 years for one single orbit around the sun and 17 hours for one rotation around its axis.he unusual thing about Uranus is that its poles are pointed directly at the sun. This means that it orbits the sun on its side. Each pole gets 42 years of sunlight and then 42 years of darkness. Uranus belongs to the gas giants.	What makes Uranus so unusual?
Uranus is unusual in that the obliquity of its ecliptic is 82° (angle between the orbital and rotational poles). The North Pole of Uranus points to somewhere near  η Ophiuchi  (in Earth's southern celestial hemisphere), about 15° northeast of  Antares , and its South Pole halfway between  Betelgeuse  and  Aldebaran . Uranus's "tropics" lie at 82° latitude and its "Arctic circles" at 8° latitude.

All eight planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in the direction that the Sun is rotating, which is  counterclockwise  when viewed from above the Sun's  north pole . Six of the planets also rotate about their axis in this same direction. The exceptions—the planets with retrograde rotation—are  Venus  and  Uranus . Venus's axial tilt is 177 degrees, which means it is spinning almost exactly in the opposite direction to its orbit. Uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77 degrees, so its axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized  protoplanet  collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.

The planet Uranus was discovered by William Herschel on March 13, 1781. He discoverd Uranus while surveying stars in the night sky using a telescope that he had built himself.Herschel noticed that one of these stars seemed different, and after observing it many more times, noticed that it orbited the Sun.He calculated that Uranus had an orbit that was about 18 times farther from the Sun than Earth. Herschel also discovered two of the moons of Uranus (Titania and Oberon).erschel noticed that one of these stars seemed different, and after observing it many more times, noticed that it orbited the Sun.

At an average distance of 3 billion km from the Sun, it takes Uranus roughly 84 years (or 30,687 days) to complete a single orbit of the Sun. The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes.As with all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation.ecause Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side, and the large moons all orbit around Uranusâ equatorial plane, the northern and southern hemispheres experience prolonged periods of daytime and nighttime (42 years at a time). As of 2008, Uranus is known to possess 13 inner moons whose orbits lie inside that of Miranda.	Tell me about the orbit of Uranus.

Uranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 3  billion  km (about 20  AU ). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of  dwarf planet   Pluto . The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth. Its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by  Pierre-Simon Laplace . With time, discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841,  John Couch Adams  first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845,  Urbain Le Verrier  began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On September 23, 1846,  Johann Gottfried Galle   located a new planet , later named  Neptune , at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.	Tell me about the orbit of Uranus.
Uranus  is the third largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a distance of about 2.8 billion kilometers (1.7 billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the  plane of the ecliptic . This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought to be the result of a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were not at all sure what to expect when observing Uranus.	Why is Uranus tilted?
In our solar system, the planet whose axis is most tilted to its orbit is Uranus, a distant, blue-green gas giant. Its extreme tilt of 97.86 degrees means that each pole of the planet faces the Sun directly for about one quarter of its 84-year orbit. No one knows how Uranus got tipped so far out of alignment with the rest of the solar system. One theory is that an encounter with another large planet twisted its spin billions of years ago. That other planet was, perhaps, flung out of the system in the encounter. Because of its extreme tilt, Uranus also has the most extreme seasons. It is now early spring in the northern hemisphere, and gigantic storms have just been seen for the first time in the planetâs thick atmosphere.	Why is Uranus tilted?
All eight planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in the direction that the Sun is rotating, which is  counterclockwise  when viewed from above the Sun's  north pole . Six of the planets also rotate about their axis in this same direction. The exceptions—the planets with retrograde rotation—are  Venus  and  Uranus . Venus's axial tilt is 177 degrees, which means it is spinning almost exactly in the opposite direction to its orbit. Uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77 degrees, so its axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized  protoplanet  collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.	Why is Uranus tilted?
But, Uranus and Venus have retrograde rotation where the axial rotation is opposite to the orbital motion; that is they have a clockwise axial rotation and a counter-clockwise orbital motion. This means that for Venus at least, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Uranus is a bit different still. Its axial tilt, which is the angle the rotational axis of a planet makes to its orbital plane, is 97.7 degree. This sideways tilt gives Uranus a unique position in which its axis of rotation is nearly in its orbital plane.	How is the rotation of Uranus different from other planets?
In the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available. Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible. An early explanation—that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them – was shown to be incorrect. Nevertheless there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter. They appear to lie at a higher altitude. The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the Voyager flyby. Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune. For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed  Uranus Dark Spot  was imaged. The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.	What is peculiar about the seasons of Uranus?
Unlike the other giant planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt that causes its seasons to be severely pronounced. The two planets also have other subtle but important differences. Uranus has more hydrogen and helium than Neptune despite being less massive overall. Neptune is therefore denser and has much more internal heat and a more active atmosphere. The  Nice model , in fact, suggests that Neptune formed closer to the  Sun  than Uranus did, and should therefore have more heavy elements.	What is peculiar about the seasons of Uranus?
For starters, each season on Uranus lasts 21 (Earth) years. Uranus, like Earth, has four seasons. But thatâs where the similarity between our seasons ends. For starters, the length of Uranusâ seasons are different from ours. It takes Earth 365 days to orbit around the sun, but it takes Uranus 84 years, more or less. So, each season on Uranus lasts 21 (Earth) years. Uranusâ seasons are also different from Earthâs because the tilts of our planets are different. Uranus, like Earth, has a nearly circular orbit, so it remains at the same distance from the sun throughout its long year.	What is peculiar about the seasons of Uranus?

That is the case for half of Uranusâ orbit. For two 21-year seasons out of its 84 year orbit around the sun, the poles are pointed more or less at the sun.

Uranus, like Earth, has four seasons. But the seasons on Earth and Uranus are very different. For starters, the length of Uranusâ seasons are different from ours. It takes Earth 365 days to orbit around the sun, but it takes Uranus 84 Earth-years, more or less. So Uranus year is 84 Earth-years along, and each season on Uranus lasts 21 earthly years.

Why are Uranus and Neptune the twin planets? Uranus and Neptune are sometimes called the twin ice giants: they are of similar size, composition, and relative distance from the sun.By comparison, Earth and Venus are al â¦ so often referred to as twins, for many of the same reasons.he outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Uranus is the seventh  planet  from the  Sun . It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the  Solar System . Uranus is similar in composition to  Neptune , and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger  gas giant s  Jupiter  and  Saturn . For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as " ice giant s" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of  hydrogen  and  helium , but it contains more " ices " such as water,  ammonia , and  methane , along with traces of other  hydrocarbon s. It is the coldest planetary  atmosphere  in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of , and has a complex, layered  cloud  structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.	Are there any other planets similar to Uranus?
At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80%  hydrogen  and 19%  helium . A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the  atmospheric methane  is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,although Neptune's vivid azure differs from Uranus's milder  cyan . Because Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.	Describe the characteristics of Neptune.
Neptune's mass of 1.0243 kg is intermediate between Earth and the larger  gas giant s: it is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of  Jupiter . Its  gravity  at 1 bar is 11.15 m/s, 1.14 times the  surface gravity  of Earth, and surpassed only by Jupiter. Neptune's  equator ial radius of 24,764 km is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune, like  Uranus , is an  ice giant , a subclass of  giant planet , due to their smaller size and higher concentrations of  volatiles  relative to Jupiter and  Saturn . In the search for  extrasolar planet s, Neptune has been used as a  metonym : discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as "Neptunes", just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as "Jupiters".	Describe the characteristics of Neptune.
The dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14  microteslas  (0.14  G ). The dipole  magnetic moment  of Neptune is about 2.2 T·m (14 μT·R, where R is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong  quadrupole  moment that may exceed the  dipole moment  in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.	Describe the characteristics of Neptune.
Neptune's  spectra  suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet  photolysis  of methane, such as  ethane  and  ethyne . The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of  carbon monoxide  and  hydrogen cyanide . The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.	Describe the characteristics of Neptune.
Why do Uranus and Neptune have a characteristic blue-green color? Methane in their atmosphere absorbs red and yellow light. Neptune emits more energy into space than it receives from the Sun, whereas Uranus does not. What visible effect does this have on the appearance of Neptune compared to that of Uranus?	Describe the characteristics of Neptune.
The largest visible feature on  Neptune  is the recurring  Great Dark Spot . It forms and dissipates every few years, as opposed to the similarly sized  Great Red Spot  of  Jupiter , which has persisted for centuries. Of all known giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune emits the most internal heat per unit of absorbed sunlight, a ratio of approximately 2.6.  Saturn , the next-highest emitter, only has a ratio of about 1.8.  Uranus  emits the least heat, one-tenth as much as Neptune. It is suspected that this may be related to its extreme 98˚  axial tilt . This causes its seasonal patterns to be very different from those of any other planet in the Solar System.	Describe the characteristics of Neptune.
High-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck. These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. Unlike Uranus, Neptune's composition has a higher volume of ocean, whereas Uranus has a smaller mantle.	Describe the characteristics of Neptune.
Spice s were among the most luxurious products available in the Middle Ages, the most common being  black pepper ,  cinnamon  (and the cheaper alternative  cassia ),  cumin ,  nutmeg ,  ginger  and  clove s. They all had to be imported from plantations in  Asia  and  Africa , which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000  ton s of pepper and 1,000 tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was  saffron , used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities;  turmeric  provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that  Cardinal Riario  offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are  grains of paradise , a relative of  cardamom  which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking,  long pepper ,  mace ,  spikenard ,  galangal  and  cubeb .  Sugar , unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and  cloves  or pepper and ginger.

Thai dishes use a wide variety of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The characteristic flavor of  kaffir lime  leaves (bai makrut) appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour  tom yam ) or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai  lime  (manao) is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with  galangal  (kha) and  lemongrass  (takhrai), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh  Thai basil , redolent with a distinctive scent reminiscent of  clove s and stems which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as  green curry . Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include phak chi, ( coriander  or cilantro leaves), rak phak chi (cilantro/coriander roots),  spearmint  (saranae),  holy basil  (kraphao), ginger (khing),  turmeric  (khamin),  fingerroot  (krachai),  culantro  (phak chi farang),   pandanus  leaves (bai toei), and  Thai lemon basil  (maenglak). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include phong phalo ( five-spice powder ), phong kari ( curry powder ), and fresh and dried  peppercorn s (phrik thai).

Latin American cuisine refers to typical foods, beverages, and cooking styles common to many of the countries and cultures in  Latin America . Latin America is a highly diverse area of land that holds various cuisines that vary from nation to nation.Some items typical of Latin American cuisine include  maize -based dishes ( tortilla s,  tamale s,  taco s,  pupusa s,  arepa s) and various  salsas  and other condiments ( guacamole ,  pico de gallo ,  mole ,  chimichurri ,  chili ,  aji ,  pebre ). These spices are generally what give the Latin American cuisines a distinct flavor; yet, each country of Latin America tends to use a different spice and those that share spices tend to use them at different quantities. Thus, this leads for a variety across the land.  Sofrito , a culinary term that originally referred to a specific combination of sauteed or braised aromatics, exists in Latin American cuisine. It refers to a sauce of tomatoes, roasted bell peppers, garlic, onions and herbs.	What cuisines use spices heavily?
Unlike other North African cuisine, Tunisian food is quite spicy. A popular condiment and ingredient which is used extensively in Tunisian cooking,  harissa , is a mix of spices commonly sold together, a paste containing the same spices, or the most important ingredient in the sauce which takes its name from the spices used. Westernised harissa almost always uses red chilies because of the trouble obtaining "black cumin" which is significantly different from standard cumin. Black cumin is readily available in the mediterranean and middle east and there are many people that say harissa is only "real" if it contains black cumin rather than chilies, which are not native to the region. Other common spices include cumin or cumin seeds, garlic, caraway seeds, coriander seeds, and paprika or smoked paprika. A recipe for the sauce includes red  chili pepper s and  garlic , flavoured with  coriander ,  cumin ,  olive oil  and often  tomato es. There is an old wives' tale that says a husband can judge his wife's affections by the amount of hot peppers she uses when preparing his food. If the food becomes bland then a man may believe that his wife no longer loves him.

Hungarian cuisine has influenced the history of the  Magyar people . The importance of  livestock  and the nomadic lifestyle of the Magyar people is apparent in the prominence of meat in Hungarian food and may be reflected in traditional meat dishes cooked over the fire like  goulash  (in Hungarian "gulyás", lit. "herdsman's (meal)"),  pörkölt  stew and the spicy fisherman's soup called  halászlé  are all traditionally cooked over the open fire in a bogrács (or cauldron). In the 15th century, King  Matthias Corvinus  and his  Neopolitan  wife Beatrice, influenced by  Renaissance  culture, introduced new ingredients such as sweet chestnut and spices such as garlic, ginger, mace, saffron and nutmeg, onion and the use of fruits in stuffings or cooked with meat. Some of these spices such as ginger and saffron are no longer used in modern Hungarian cuisine. At that time and later, considerable numbers of  Saxons  (a German ethnic group), Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the  Ottoman era , in the form of sweets (for example different  nougat s, such as white nougat called törökméz,  quince  (birsalma) sweets,  Turkish delight ),  Turkish coffee  or rice dishes such as  pilaf  (in Transylvania), meat and vegetable dishes such as the  eggplant , used in  eggplant salads and appetizers , stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called  töltött káposzta . Hungarian cuisine was influenced by  Austrian cuisine  under the  Austro-Hungarian Empire ; dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa. Some cakes and sweets in Hungary show a strong German-Austrian influence. All told, modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine.	What cuisines use spices heavily?

Tillage farming involves planting crops of wheat, barley and maize to be harvested and sold to local feed mills and in turn sold back to the beef and dairy farmers .	What are the main types of cattle farming?
Certain breeds of cattle, such as the  Holstein-Friesian , are used to produce milk, which can be processed into dairy products such as  milk ,  cheese  or  yogurt . Dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production. Most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a dairy product. For dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year. If the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered at a young age to produce  veal . They will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth. Over the last fifty years, dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow. The  Holstein-Friesian  is the breed of dairy cow most common in the UK,  Europe  and the United States. It has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow. Around 22 litres per day is average in the UK.	What cattle breeds produce the most milk?

The Sahiwal Cattle breed is the best dairy breed of zebu or humped cattle (Bos Indicus), followed by the very similar Red Sindhi and Butana breeds. It originated in the dry Punjab region which lies along the Indian-Pakistani Border, and was once kept in large herds by professional herdsmen called "Jaanglees". With the introduction of irrigation to the region their numbers dripped, and farmers used them as draft and dairy animals. The Division Sahiwal has one of the best dairy breeds in India and Pakistan. It is thick-resistant, heat-tolerant and resistant to parasites, both internal and external. Cows average 2270 kilograms of milk while suckling a calf and much higher milk yields have been recorded. Due to their heat tolerance and high milk production they have been exported to other Asian countries, Africa, Caribbean and around the world. As oxen, they are docile but slow, making them more useful for slow work. Their colour can range from reddish brown to red, with varying amounts of white on the neck, and the underline. In males, the colour darkens towards the extremities, such as the head, legs and tails. Sahiwal breed arrived in Australia via New Guinea in the early 1950s. In Australia, the Sahiwal breed was initially selected as a dual-purpose breed. It played a valuable role in the development of the two Australian tropical dairy breeds, the Australian milking zebu and the Australian Fresian Sahiwal. Sahiwal breeds are now used in Australia for beef production, as crossing high-grade Sahiwal sires with Bos taurus animals produced a carcass of lean quality with desirable fat cover.

A cow will produce large amounts of milk over its lifetime. Certain breeds produce more milk than others; however, different breeds produce within a range of around 6,800 to 17,000 kg (15,000 to 37,500 lbs) of milk per lactation.  The Holstein Friesian is the main breed of dairy cattle in Australia, and said to have the "world's highest" productivity, at 10000L of milk per year.  The average for a single dairy cow in the US in 2007 was 9164.4 kg (20,204 lbs) per year, excluding milk consumed by her calves, whereas the same average value for a single cow in Israel was reported in the Philippine press to be 12,240 kg in 2009.  Production levels peak at around 40 to 60 days after calving.  The cow is then bred.  Production declines steadily afterwards, until, at about 305 days after calving, the cow is 'dried off', and milking ceases.  About sixty days later, one year after the birth of her previous calf, a cow will calve again.  High production cows are more difficult to breed at a one-year interval. Many farms take the view that 13 or even 14 month cycles are more appropriate for this type of cow.	What cattle breeds produce the most milk?

A Scottish breed of cattle. Formerly called Aberdeen Angus after their place of origin, Angus cattle are among the most commonly used breeds in American beef production. The Black Angus cattle that we see today originated from four Scottish bulls that were brought to Victoria, Kansas.ngus cattle are raised all over the world and generally come in two colors: black and red. Angus Beef standards were developed in 1978. They were brought about in order to indicate particular levels of marbling, tenderness, age and color for the meat that qualified for the Angus Beef label.	Where are angus beef from?

Q: How many acres do you need for a cow and calf? A: The acreage required for a cow-calf pair will depend on several things: mainly soil fertility, pasture quality and how much rain you get in your area. For example, most places in Missouri start with 3-4 acres per cow-calf pair for summer grazing.: Cows will eat 2% of their body weight in hay per day in the winter. You can figure that you are going to need to feed hay around 150 days per year. If your cow weighs 1,200 pounds, she will need 24 pounds of good quality hay for 150 days. So a good starting point would be to have 3,600 pounds of hay per cow per year.	How much space do cows need?
Smoking most commonly leads to diseases affecting the heart and  lungs  and will most commonly affect areas such as hands or feet with first signs of smoking related health issues showing up as numbness, with smoking being a major risk factor for  heart attacks ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD),  emphysema , and  cancer , particularly  lung cancer , cancers of the  larynx  and  mouth , and  pancreatic cancer . Overall life expectancy is also reduced in long term smokers, with estimates ranging from 10 to 17.9. years fewer than nonsmokers. About one half of long term male smokers will die of illness due to smoking. The association of smoking with lung cancer is strongest, both in the public perception and etiologically. Among male smokers, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 17.2%; among female smokers, the risk is 11.6%. This risk is significantly lower in nonsmokers: 1.3% in men and 1.4% in women. Historically, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease prior to  World War I  and was perceived as something most physicians would never see during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking came a virtual epidemic of lung cancer.	What are the long term effects of smoking?
Longer term effects of smoking on the breathing system. Some of the chemicals in cigarette smoke can cause serious damage to the delicate tissues of the breathing system. There is clear scientific evidence linking tobacco smoking to a greatly increased risk of suffering from a number of serious and even fatal diseases.Here are three examples:mmediate effects of smoking on the breathing system. Smoking is bad for your health from the very first cigarette, because some of the chemicals in the smoke have an immediate effect on your body. 1  Carbon monoxide from the smoke is taken into your blood instead of oxygen.

Researchers and statisticians began to suspect a link between smoking and lung cancer as early as 1900. The first medical studies linking smoking to this and other illnesses began to appear in the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1960 over 7,000 studies established a link between smoking and health problems. In 1962, with this ever-expanding body of medical research as a backdrop, Dr. Luther L. Terry, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, convened an advisory committee to examine the issue of the link between smoking and illness. Though there were a few restrictions during the 17th century, significant anti-smoking legislation was not enforced until later in the 19th century. According to the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health published in 1964, the  Surgeon General  reported not only that the nicotine and tar in cigarettes caused lung cancer, but also that smoking was the most important cause of chronic bronchitis, increased risk of dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and caused coronary disease. As a result, Congress enacted the  Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act  in 1965, which created the first cigarette warning label in the United States by requiring health warnings on all cigarette packages saying "Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health."  A few years later, Congress passed the  Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act  of 1969, which banned cigarette advertising on television and radio as well as slightly changed the health warning to "Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health."  However, in a 1981 report to Congress, the  Federal Trade Commission  concluded that the health warning labels were not effective enough on public knowledge and peoples' attitudes towards smoking. This led to the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984.	Does smoking cause cancer?
Some of the risk factors include: Cigarette smoking:Cigarette smoking doubles the risk of pancreatic cancer. In fact, some scientists have estimated that one in four, or one in five cases of pancreatic cancer are caused by smoking cigarettes. Smoking is also associated with early age at diagnosis. Very importantly, the risk of pancreatic cancer drops close to normal in people who quit smoking. Simply put, cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of pancreatic cancer. Age: The risk of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age. Over 80% of pancreatic cancers develop between the ages of 60 and 80 years.	Does smoking cause cancer?

Nicotine , the primary psychoactive chemical in cigarettes, is highly addictive.  The resulting use of tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. Smoking leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, being a major risk factor for  heart attacks ,  stroke s,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) (including  emphysema  and  chronic bronchitis ), and  cancer  (particularly  lung cancer ,  cancers of the larynx and mouth , and  pancreatic cancer ). It also causes peripheral vascular disease and  hypertension . On average, each cigarette smoked is estimated to shorten life by 11 minutes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in  tar  increases the risk of these diseases. The  World Health Organization   estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. Cigarettes produce an aerosol containing over 4,000 chemical compounds, including nicotine, carbon monoxide, acrolein, and oxidant substances. Over 50 of these are  carcinogen s.

In 1964,  Surgeon General   Luther Terry  issued a report on smoking and health saying that tobacco causes lung cancer and is a main contributor to  bronchitis . Members of the  Federal Trade Commission  read the report the day it was released and quickly proposed a mandatory cigarette label that warned, "CAUTION: cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health and may cause death from cancer and other diseases." However, Congress intervened to block this warning label with language that was less dire. In 1965, the  United States Congress  passed the  Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act  (FCLAA), which required a health warning on all cigarette packs. In 1970, President  Richard Nixon  signed the  Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act , which banned cigarettes ads on the radio or television. It also required an updated warning on the cigarette packages which read: "Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."	Does smoking cause cancer?

In June 2011, the FDA released nine new warning signs containing both graphic text and images that should be included on all cigarette packaging and advertisement by September 2012. The textual warnings state:"WARNING: Cigarettes are addictive. WARNING: Tobacco smoke can harm your children.WARNING: Cigarettes cause fatal lung disease.WARNING: Cigarettes cause cancer.WARNING: Cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease.WARNING: Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby.WARNING: Smoking can kill you.WARNING: Tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in nonsmokers.WARNING: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health." Each warning is to be paired with one of the following colored images:  a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole in his throat; a plume of cigarette smoke enveloping an infant receiving a kiss from his or her mother; a pair of diseased lungs next to a pair of healthy lungs; a diseased mouth afflicted with what appears to be cancerous lesions; a man breathing into an oxygen mask; a bare-chested male cadaver lying on a table, and featuring what appears to be post-autopsy chest staples down the middle of his torso; a woman weeping uncontrollably; or a man wearing a T-shirt that features a "no smoking" symbol and the words "I Quit."

Underage  smoking  in  Australia  is still a major concern, although the Australian government has reduced the number of smokers each year, through numerous and intensive anti-smoking campaigns (National Tobacco Campaign). As a result, from these campaigns, statics have been recorded and compared from surveys completed throughout Australia, showing how the numbers of underage smokers have drastically decreased in the years between 1991 and 2013. However, adolescents are still being influenced to try smoking, such influences include: family, advertising and school. The amount of advertising that is being publicised, is still striking attention in adolescent’s minds, this is why  tobacco smoking  is still relatively popular among young people in Australia. The broadcasts promoting smoking are found to be highly influential to the targeted audience, regardless of age, however it is young people who it is affecting the most. Almost all smokers start while they are young, and studies have found that nearly all first time smoking experiences take place during high school years. The younger a person is when they start smoking, commonly  tobacco , the more likely the person is to use it as an adult; which results in having more trouble quitting, as opposed to starting smoking later on in life. Substances that are commonly smoked by adolescents in Australia include  cigarette s,  marijuana ,  hookah s and  electronic cigarette s. It is known that while being an adolescent and smoking, there is an increased higher risk of establishing a smoking addiction rapidly, with adolescent smokers forming a sense of dependence. This is consistently initiated with smoking  cigarette s, as  nicotine  is the addictive drug found in tobacco smoke. Adolescents taking part in the commencement of smoking don’t take into consideration the struggle of being able to quit, as smoking can destroy their education and bring upon many smoking-related health complications.

NiQuitin is a range of  nicotine  replacement products designed to help smokers quit by replacing the nicotine supplied by cigarettes with a lower, steadier level in order to relieve withdrawal. This is to help users wean off nicotine gradually. Nicotine replacement therapy products (e.g. chewing gum, lozenges, transdermal systems) are indicated as temporary aids for the cigarette smoker who wants to give up smoking. They serve as alternative sources of nicotine and provide relief of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in nicotine-dependent individuals who are acutely withdrawing from cigarette smoking.

While acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of nicotine receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitisation of nicotine receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with research showing low dose nicotine patches being an effective treatment of  major depressive disorder  in non-smokers. However, the original research concluded that: "Nicotine patches produced short-term improvement of depression with minor side effects. Because of nicotine's high risk to health, nicotine patches are not recommended for clinical use in depression."	How effective are the patches?

" Cold turkey " is a colloquial term indicating abrupt withdrawal from an addictive drug, and in this context indicates sudden and complete cessation of all nicotine use. In three studies, it was the quitting method cited by 76%, 85%, or 88% of long-term successful quitters. In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was "not at all difficult" to stop, 27% said it was "fairly difficult", and the remaining 20% found it very difficult. Studies have found that two-thirds of recent quitters reported using the cold turkey method and found it helpful.	Tell me about the cold turkey method.
The most documented symptoms are cravings for nicotine, anger/irritability,  anxiety ,  depression , impatience,  trouble sleeping ,  restlessness ,  hunger  or  weight gain , and difficulty concentrating. Symptoms are usually strongest for the first few days and then dissipate over 2-4 weeks. Withdrawal symptoms make it harder to quit nicotine products and most methods for  quitting smoking  involve reducing nicotine withdrawal. The most common symptoms are irritability, anxiety and difficulty concentrating. Depression and insomnia are the least common. Other withdrawal symptoms may include constipation, cough, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, impulsivity, fatigue, flu symptoms, mood swings, mouth ulcers, and increased dreaming. Cessation of nicotine usually increases eating and weight, decreases memory, decreases the ability to pay attention and concentrate on tasks, and decreased heart rate. Cessation of tobacco can also require changes in levels of various medications.	Describe typical withdrawal symptoms.
The most common natural predator of sperm whales is the  orca , but  pilot whale s and  false killer whale s sometimes harass them. Orcas prey on target groups of females with young, usually making an effort to extract and kill a calf. The adults will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them.  They may face inwards with their tails out (the 'marguerite formation', named after  the flower ). The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale can deliver lethal blows. Alternatively, they may face outwards (the 'heads-out formation'). Other than sperm whales,  southern right whale s had been observed to perform similar formations. However, formations in non dangerous situations have been recorded as well. Early whalers exploited this behaviour, attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members. If the orca pod is extremely large, its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales. Solitary mature males are known to interfere and come to the aid of vulnerable groups nearby. Individual large mature male sperm whales have no non-human predators, and are believed to be too large, powerful and aggressive to be threatened by orcas. In addition, male sperm whales have been observed to attack and intimidate orca pods. An incident was filmed from a long-line trawler: an orca pod was systematically taking fish caught on the trawler's long lines (as the lines were being pulled into the ship) when a male sperm whale appeared to repeatedly charge the orca pod in an attempt to drive them away; it was speculated by the film crew that the sperm whale was attempting to access the same fish. The orcas employed a tail outward and tail slapping defensive position against the bull sperm whale similar to that used by female sperm whales against attacking orcas.	Tell me about Orca whales.

The most common natural predator of sperm whales is the  orca , but  pilot whale s and  false killer whale s sometimes harass them. Orcas prey on target groups of females with young, usually making an effort to extract and kill a calf. The adults will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them.  They may face inwards with their tails out (the 'marguerite formation', named after  the flower ). The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale can deliver lethal blows. Alternatively, they may face outwards (the 'heads-out formation'). Other than sperm whales,  southern right whale s had been observed to perform similar formations. However, formations in non dangerous situations have been recorded as well. Early whalers exploited this behaviour, attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members. If the orca pod is extremely large, its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales. Solitary mature males are known to interfere and come to the aid of vulnerable groups nearby.

There is one documented case in  National Geographic Magazine  of a blue whale being attacked by  orca s off the  Baja California Peninsula ; although the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably died as a result of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off of  California , with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.	Are Orca whales dangerous?

On the West Coast of Canada and the United States, excellent whale watching can be found in Alaska (summer), British Columbia, and the San Juan Islands/Puget Sound in  Washington , where orca pods are sometimes visible from shore.  Three types of orca pods can be observed during the summer months in the Northeast Pacific: resident, transient, and offshore killer whales. On the  Oregon Coast , several whale species, especially  gray whale s, may be seen year-round, and the state trains volunteers to assist tourists in the winter months, during whale migration season.  In  California , good whale-watching can be found year-round on the Southern California coast. During the winter and spring (December–May),  gray whale s can be seen from shore on their annual migration (the best spot being  Point Vicente ), while  blue whale s are often seen between July and October.

In  Spain  whale watching is available along the  Strait of Gibraltar , the  Canary Islands , and in the  Bay of Biscay .  Tarifa  is the most important whale watching town in the Strait of Gibraltar; this gateway to the  Mediterranean Sea  is also a central point in between the colder waters to the North and the tropical waters off of Africa: a good route for migrating cetaceans. The species observed in this area are:  bottlenose dolphin ,  common dolphin ,  striped dolphin ,  pilot whale ,  sperm whale ,  fin whale  and  orca .	Where can go to watch Orca whales?
On the West Coast of Canada and the United States, excellent whale watching can be found in Alaska (summer), British Columbia, and the San Juan Islands/Puget Sound in  Washington , where orca pods are sometimes visible from shore.  Three types of orca pods can be observed during the summer months in the Northeast Pacific: resident, transient, and offshore killer whales. On the  Oregon Coast , several whale species, especially  gray whale s, may be seen year-round, and the state trains volunteers to assist tourists in the winter months, during whale migration season.  In  California , good whale-watching can be found year-round on the Southern California coast. During the winter and spring (December–May),  gray whale s can be seen from shore on their annual migration (the best spot being  Point Vicente ), while  blue whale s are often seen between July and October.  Fin whales ,  minke whales ,  orcas , and various species of dolphins can be seen year-round. In spring, summer, and fall at the  Farallon Islands  off  San Francisco , one may see  humpbacks ,  grays , and  blue whales . In  Mexico , the various  lagoons  of  Baja California Sur  become breeding habitat in February and March. A number of towns in the  Mexican state  celebrate the whale's arrival with festivals such as  Guerrero Negro , in the first half of February and the port of  San Blas  on 24 and 25 February.

In August 2014, SeaWorld announced it planned to build new killer whale tanks that would be almost double the size of the existing ones to provide more space for its whales, scheduled for completion in 2018. The company maintained the move was not in response to the release of the Blackfish documentary. Wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres (100 mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.  PETA , which opposes whales being kept in captivity has proposed the theme park operator base its whales in seaside sanctuaries. The company also pledged $10 million in matching funds for killer whale research. The plans to increase the size of the tanks in San Diego were put on hold in October 2015 after the  California Coastal Commission  ruled that the work could only go ahead if they banned captive breeding which would eventually lead to end of killer whale shows at the park. On March 17, 2016, SeaWorld announced the end of their breeding program, which signifies the last generation of orcas in captivity in their care, though Takara was still pregnant at the time. Theatrical orca shows will end at SeaWorld San Diego in 2017 and in Orlando and San Antonio in 2019.	How does captivity affect Orca whales?
5. SeaWorldâs breeding program results in a high number of stillbirths. Orcas are notoriously difficult breeders -- even more so in captivity. In fact, until the whale Kalina was born in September 1985, no captive-born orca was able to survive more than a few days.opics: cetaceans tilikum orcas whales inbreeding marine mammals blackfish orca whales seaworld seaworld breeding orca breeding captivity.

Organizations such as  World Animal Protection  and the  Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society  campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the  dorsal fin  collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s, although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas, Corky II and Lolita, are in their mid-40s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior. Wild killer whales may travel up to  in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of  stress .	How does captivity affect Orca whales?
The lifespan of killer whales in captivity versus wild killer whales is disputed.  Several studies published in scientific journals show that the average mortality rate for captive killer whales is approximately three times higher than in the wild. A 2015 study in the  Journal of Mammalogy , authored by SeaWorld's vice-president of theriogenology, Todd Robeck, concluded that the life expectancy for killer whales born at SeaWorld is the same as those in the wild. In the wild, female killer whales have a typical lifespan of 60–80 years, and a maximum recorded lifespan of 103 years.  The average lifespan for males in the wild is 30 years, but some live up to 50–60 years. The 2015 study has been criticised by Trevor Willis, senior lecture in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, "clearly wrong" and indicative of "poor practice".  He stated that it is misleading in two ways: "First, it compares two completely different circumstances: the controlled environment of a swimming pool, with highly trained vets on hand; and the wild ocean. "There are no predators in a swimming pool. Second, and in the absence of any other information, it appears they’ve looked at the survival rate of calves in the first two years of life and extrapolated it out 50 years into the future." He also stated that no captive orca has lived for 55.8 years, the recorded average life expectancy of adult orcas at SeaWorld.	How does captivity affect Orca whales?

The infection has the potential of seriously harming or even causing the  death  of a  preterm infant , an  infant of low or very low birth weight , or an infant with an  immune system defect  or a  congenital defect  of the immune system. The presence of this  pathogen  can sometimes be determined by the  symptoms  that appear as a  gastrointestinal illness  in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other  animal products  such as,  hot dogs ,  delicatessen meats , and  cheese .	Can dairy products harm you instead?
Milk products and production relationships. A dairy product or milk product is food produced from the milk of mammals. Dairy products are usually high energy-yielding food products. A production plant for the processing of milk is called a dairy or a dairy factory.Apart from breastfed infants, the human consumption of dairy products is sourced primarily from the milk of cows, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, yaks, horses, camels, domestic buffaloes, and other mammals.dditionally dairy products including cheese, ice cream, milk, butter, and yogurt can contribute significant amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat to the diet. Diets high in fat and especially in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease and can cause other serious health problems.	Can dairy products harm you instead?

Whatâs clear is that the cholesterol-controlling benefits are due to soluble fiber, one of two types of fiber. Soluble fiber is found in the flesh of fruit such as pears and apples, vegetables like peas, and whole grains, such as oats and barley. The second important type of fiber, insoluble fiber, is indigestible and also a necessary part of a healthy diet, but not for controlling cholesterol â itâs the kind that helps with digestion. âHigh-fiber foods that contain soluble fiber appear to affect short-chain fatty acids in the bloodstream,â Van Horn says.

Causes of Diverticulitis. Todayâs typical western diet often consists of highly processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats. This type of diet contributes to the development of diverticula, and an infection. Eating a diet rich with fiber can help to prevent diverticulitis, and helps in the healing of the colon. All of these risk factors, combined with a diet lacking in necessary fiber, and high in animal fats, can lead to the development of marble-sized diverticula in the digestive tract.

People often don't consume the recommended amount of fiber in their diet, which can increase the risk for constipation because fiber bulks up your stool and ensures that it moves quickly through your digestive system. If you increase your fiber consumption too quickly, it can upset your stomach or make constipation worse. Women should consume at least 21 to 25 grams of fiber per day, and men should consume at least 30 to 38 grams. Eat a variety of fiber-containing foods to ensure that you consume a mix of soluble and insoluble fiber.	What happens if fiber is consumed in a smaller amount than recommended?
Linux on z gives the flexibility of running Linux with the advantages of  fault-tolerant mainframe hardware  capable of over 90,000 I/O operations per second and with a  mean time between failure (MTBF)  measured in decades. Using virtualization, numerous smaller servers can be combined onto one mainframe, gaining some benefits of centralization and cost reduction, while still allowing specialized servers. Instead of  paravirtualization , IBM mainframes use  full virtualization , which permits workload density far greater than paravirtualization does. Combining full virtualization of the hardware plus lightweight  Virtual Machine  containers that run Linux in isolation (somewhat similar in concept to  Docker ) result in a platform that supports more virtual servers than any other in a single footprint, which also can lower operating costs. Additional savings can be seen from reduced need for floor space, power, cooling, networking hardware, and the other  infrastructure  needed to support a  data center . IBM mainframes allow transparent use of  redundant processor execution steps  and  integrity checking , which is important for critical applications in certain industries such as banking.. Mainframes typically allow  hot-swapping of hardware , such as processors and memory. z Systems provides fault tolerance for all key components, including processors, memory, I/O Interconnect, power supply, channel paths, network cards, and others. Through internal monitoring, possible problems are detected and problem components are designed to be switched over without even failing a single transaction. In the rare event of failure, firmware will automatically enable a spare component, disable the failing component, and notify IBM to dispatch a service representative. This is transparent to the operating system, allowing routine repairs to be performed without shutting down the system.  Industries continue to rely on mainframes because they are genuinely the best option, in terms of reliability, security, and often cost.	What are some advantages of using Linux?
The  Ubuntu distribution  is a popular version of Linux. Strangely enough, Ubuntu didn't have desktop search until Feisty Fawn 7.04. Using  Tracker  desktop search, the desktop search feature was very similar to Mac OS's AppleSearch and Sherlock. Considering the fact that both are UNIX-based systems. Tracker, released in late 2007, was built to have a relatively low impact on system resources. But unfortunately occasionally had sporadic control over what resources it was using. It not only featured the basic features of file format sorting and meta-data matching, but support for searching through emails and instant messages was added. Years later, in 2014  Recoll  was added to Linux distributions, it works with other search programs such as Tracker and  Beagle  to provide efficient full text search. This greatly increased the types of queries that Linux desktop searches could handle as well as file types. A major advantage of Recoll is that it allows for greater customization of what is indexed. For example, Recoll will index the entire hard disk by default, but will and can index just a few select directories instead of wasting time indexing directories you know you will never need to look at. It also allows for more search options, you may actually narrow down what kind of query you want to ask. For example, you could search for just file types or by content.

You can install windows software in the virtual machine and run it on your Linux desktop. Virtual machines introduce some overhead, but with todayâs fast CPUs, running many types of software in a virtual machine shouldnât be a problem. This is especially true after youâve tweaked those virtual machines for speed.se Wine. Wine is a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Linux. Itâs basically an implementation of the Windows API on Linux. Of course, Microsoft doesnât publish all the information we need to re-implement the Windows API from scratch, so Wine has to be reverse-engineered.	Can I run Windows software in Linux?
Many other types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X also run on Linux. Commonly, either a  free software  application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system, or that application will have a version that works on Linux, such as with  Skype  and some  video games  like  Dota 2  and  Team Fortress 2 . Furthermore, the  Wine  project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. It is sponsored by commercial interests including  CodeWeavers , which produces a commercial version of the software. Since 2009, Google has also provided funding to the Wine project.  CrossOver , a proprietary solution based on the open-source Wine project, supports running Windows versions of  Microsoft Office ,  Intuit  applications such as  Quicken  and  QuickBooks ,  Adobe Photoshop  versions through CS2, and many popular games such as  World of Warcraft . In other cases, where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as  desktop publishing  and  professional audio , there is equivalent software available on Linux.

For example, the  Linux kernel  is not compatible with Windows. This does not mean that Linux can't be binary compatible with Windows applications. Additional software,  Wine , is available that does that to some degree. The  ReactOS  OS development effort, seeks to create an  open source ,  free software  OS that is binary compatible with  Microsoft's   Windows NT  family of OSes using Wine for application compatibility and reimplementing the Windows kernel for additional compatibility such as for drivers whereas Linux would use Linux drivers not Windows drivers.   FreeBSD  and other members of the  BSD  family have binary compatibility with the  Linux kernel  in  usermode  by translating Linux system calls into BSD ones.  This enables the application and libraries code that run on  Linux -based OSes to be run on BSD as well.	Can I run Windows software in Linux?
Some specific proprietary software products are not available in any form for Linux. As of September 2015, the  Steam  gaming service has 1,500 games available on Linux, compared to 2,323 games for Mac and 6,500 Windows games.  Emulation  and API-translation projects like  Wine  and  CrossOver  make it possible to run non-Linux-based software on Linux systems, either by emulating a proprietary operating system or by translating proprietary API calls (e.g., calls to Microsoft's  Win32  or  DirectX  APIs) into native Linux API calls. A  virtual machine  can also be used to run a proprietary OS (like Microsoft Windows) on top of Linux.	Can I run Windows software in Linux?
Linux Mint comes with a wide range of software installed that includes  LibreOffice ,  Firefox ,  Thunderbird ,  HexChat ,  Pidgin ,  Transmission ,  VLC media player  and  GIMP . Additional software that is not installed by default can be downloaded using the package manager. Linux Mint allows  networking ports  to be closed using its  firewall , with customized port selection available. The default Linux Mint  desktop environment s,  MATE  and  Cinnamon , support many languages. Linux Mint can also run many programs designed for  Microsoft Windows  (such as  Microsoft Office ), using the  Wine  Windows  compatibility layer  software for Linux, or  virtualization  software, including  VMware Workstation  and  VirtualBox , or  KVM  (Kernel based Virtual Machine, built into the Linux kernel) hypervisor using Virtual Machine Manager.

In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the  total cost of ownership  (TCO) of  Windows Server 2003  to  Linux ; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO). This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the  Yankee Group  concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the  switching costs  from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products. Another study, released by the  Open Source Development Labs , claimed that the Microsoft studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.

Critics of Linux on the desktop have frequently argued that limited availability of native versions of top-selling  video game s on the platform holds adoption back, sometimes ignoring the fact that developers of games, not the Linux Foundation, are responsible for supporting the operating system. This creates a  chicken or the egg  situation where developers make games for Windows due to its market share as well as driver support, and gamers use Windows due to availability of games. As of September 2015, the  Steam  gaming service has 1,500 games available on Linux, compared to 2,323 games for Mac and 6,500 Windows games. Additionally one can either run the games through  Wine , a  virtual machine , or dual-booting.	How does Linux compare to Windows?
Microsoft encourages  original equipment manufacturer s (OEMs) to supply computers with Windows pre-installed, saying that consumers benefit by not having to install an operating system.  Analyst Vishal Tripathi said that many consumers purchase PCs with pre-installed operating systems because they do not want to deal with the "learning curve" and inconvenience of installing an operating system.  Virtually all large computer vendors  bundle  Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges.  In 1999,  Maximum PC  wrote that non-Windows users "have long griped that machines from large companies can't be purchased without Windows".  In 1999, analyst Rob Enderle attributed the lack of computers without Windows available for individual purchase to economic impracticality, citing certification and warranty requirements.  In 1999, Dell stated that it only offered non-Microsoft operating systems on servers and as part of customized large orders, but if Linux became popular enough to make Linux pre-installation cost-effective, "we'd be foolish not to offer it".   The Guardian s computer editor Jack Schofield said that there were significant overhead costs associated with pre-installation of Linux, in part due to Linux's small market share.  Serdar Yegulalp of  Computerworld  said that in the late 1990s, because Linux was not fully developed, Linux computers were "a tough sell for non-technical users".	How does Linux compare to Windows?
